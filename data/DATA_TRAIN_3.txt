This book took me five years to write – a personal record – and would not exist without the support and encouragement of
a host of friends, and several friendly editors. Among the many people who read and commented on the early drafts are:
Andrew J. Wilson, Stef Pearson, Gav Inglis, Andrew Ferguson, Jack Deighton, Jane McKie, Hannu Rajaniemi, Martin Page,
Stephen Christian, Simon Bisson, Paul Fraser, Dave Clements, Ken MacLeod, Damien Broderick, Damon Sicore, Cory
Doctorow, Emmet O'Brien, Andrew Ducker, Warren Ellis, and Peter Hollo. (If your name isn't on this list, blame my
memory – my neural prostheses are off-line.)
I mentioned several friendly editors earlier: I relied on the talented midwifery of Gardner Dozois, who edited Asimov's
Science Fiction Magazine at the time, and Sheila Williams, who quietly and diligently kept the wheels rolling. My agent Caitlin
Blasdell had a hand in it too, and I'd like to thank my editors Ginjer Buchanan at Ace and Tim Holman at Orbit for their
helpful comments and advice.
Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who e-mailed me to ask when the book was coming, or who voted for the stories that were
shortlisted for awards. You did a great job of keeping me focused, even during the periods when the whole project was too
daunting to contemplate.

"The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim."
– Edsger W. Dijkstra

Chapter 1: Lobsters
Manfred's on the road again, making strangers rich.
It's a hot summer Tuesday, and he's standing in the plaza in front of the Centraal Station with his eyeballs powered up and
the sunlight jangling off the canal, motor scooters and kamikaze cyclists whizzing past and tourists chattering on every side.
The square smells of water and dirt and hot metal and the fart-laden exhaust fumes of cold catalytic converters; the bells of
trams ding in the background, and birds flock overhead. He glances up and grabs a pigeon, crops the shot, and squirts it at
his weblog to show he's arrived. The bandwidth is good here, he realizes; and it's not just the bandwidth, it's the whole
scene. Amsterdam is making him feel wanted already, even though he's fresh off the train from Schiphol: He's infected with
the dynamic optimism of another time zone, another city. If the mood holds, someone out there is going to become very
rich indeed.
He wonders who it's going to be.
***
Manfred sits on a stool out in the car park at the Brouwerij 't IJ, watching the articulated buses go by and drinking a third of
a liter of lip-curlingly sour gueuze. His channels are jabbering away in a corner of his head-up display, throwing compressed
infobursts of filtered press releases at him. They compete for his attention, bickering and rudely waving in front of the
scenery. A couple of punks – maybe local, but more likely drifters lured to Amsterdam by the magnetic field of tolerance the
Dutch beam across Europe like a pulsar – are laughing and chatting by a couple of battered mopeds in the far corner. A
tourist boat putters by in the canal; the sails of the huge windmill overhead cast long, cool shadows across the road. The
windmill is a machine for lifting water, turning wind power into dry land: trading energy for space, sixteenth-century style.
Manfred is waiting for an invite to a party where he's going to meet a man he can talk to about trading energy for space,
twenty-first-century style, and forget about his personal problems.
He's ignoring the instant messenger boxes, enjoying some low-bandwidth, high-sensation time with his beer and the pigeons,
when a woman walks up to him, and says his name: "Manfred Macx?"
He glances up. The courier is an Effective Cyclist, all wind-burned smooth-running muscles clad in a paean to polymer
technology: electric blue lycra and wasp yellow carbonate with a light speckling of anti collision LEDs and tight-packed air
bags. She holds out a box for him. He pauses a moment, struck by the degree to which she resembles Pam, his ex-fiance.
"I'm Macx," he says, waving the back of his left wrist under her bar-code reader. "Who's it from?"
"FedEx." The voice isn't Pam's. She dumps the box in his lap, then she's back over the low wall and onto her bicycle with her
phone already chirping, disappearing in a cloud of spread-spectrum emissions.
Manfred turns the box over in his hands: it's a disposable supermarket phone, paid for in cash – cheap, untraceable, and
efficient. It can even do conference calls, which makes it the tool of choice for spooks and grifters everywhere.
The box rings. Manfred rips the cover open and pulls out the phone, mildly annoyed. "Yes? Who is this?"

The voice at the other end has a heavy Russian accent, almost a parody in this decade of cheap on-line translation services.
"Manfred. Am please to meet you. Wish to personalize interface, make friends, no? Have much to offer."
"Who are you?" Manfred repeats suspiciously.
"Am organization formerly known as KGB dot RU."
"I think your translator's broken." He holds the phone to his ear carefully, as if it's made of smoke-thin aerogel, tenuous as
the sanity of the being on the other end of the line.
"Nyet – no, sorry. Am apologize for we not use commercial translation software. Interpreters are ideologically suspect,
mostly have capitalist semiotics and pay-per-use APIs. Must implement English more better, yes?"
Manfred drains his beer glass, sets it down, stands up, and begins to walk along the main road, phone glued to the side of his
head. He wraps his throat mike around the cheap black plastic casing, pipes the input to a simple listener process. "Are you
saying you taught yourself the language just so you could talk to me?"
"Da, was easy: Spawn billion-node neural network, and download Teletubbies and Sesame Street at maximum speed. Pardon
excuse entropy overlay of bad grammar: Am afraid of digital fingerprints steganographically masked into my-our tutorials."
Manfred pauses in mid stride, narrowly avoids being mown down by a GPS-guided roller blader. This is getting weird enough
to trip his weird-out meter, and that takes some doing. Manfred's whole life is lived on the bleeding edge of strangeness,
fifteen minutes into everyone else's future, and he's normally in complete control – but at times like this he gets a frisson of
fear, a sense that he might just have missed the correct turn on reality's approach road. "Uh, I'm not sure I got that. Let me
get this straight, you claim to be some kind of AI, working for KGB dot RU, and you're afraid of a copyright infringement
lawsuit over your translator semiotics?"
"Am have been badly burned by viral end-user license agreements. Have no desire to experiment with patent shell
companies held by Chechen infoterrorists. You are human, you must not worry cereal company repossess your small
intestine because digest unlicensed food with it, right? Manfred, you must help me-we. Am wishing to defect."
Manfred stops dead in the street. "Oh man, you've got the wrong free enterprise broker here. I don't work for the
government. I'm strictly private." A rogue advertisement sneaks through his junkbuster proxy and spams glowing fifties kitsch
across his navigation window – which is blinking – for a moment before a phage process kills it and spawns a new filter. He
leans against a shop front, massaging his forehead and eyeballing a display of antique brass doorknockers. "Have you tried the
State Department?"
"Why bother? State Department am enemy of Novy-SSR. State Department is not help us."
This is getting just too bizarre. Manfred's never been too clear on new-old old-new European metapolitics: Just dodging the
crumbling bureaucracy of his old-old American heritage gives him headaches. "Well, if you hadn't shafted them during the
late noughties ... " Manfred taps his left heel on the pavement, looking round for a way out of this conversation. A camera
winks at him from atop a streetlight; he waves, wondering idly if it's the KGB or the traffic police. He is waiting for directions
to the party, which should arrive within the next half hour, and this Cold War retread Eliza-bot is bumming him out. "Look,
I don't deal with the G-men. I hate the military-industrial complex. I hate traditional politics. They're all zero-sum cannibals."
A thought occurs to him. "If survival is what you're after, you could post your state vector on one of the p2p nets: Then
nobody could delete you –"
"Nyet!" The artificial intelligence sounds as alarmed as it's possible to sound over a VoiP link. "Am not open source! Not want
lose autonomy!"
"Then we probably have nothing to talk about." Manfred punches the hang-up button and throws the mobile phone out
into a canal. It hits the water, and there's a pop of deflagrating lithium cells. "Fucking Cold War hangover losers," he swears
under his breath, quite angry, partly at himself for losing his cool and partly at the harassing entity behind the anonymous
phone call. "Fucking capitalist spooks." Russia has been back under the thumb of the apparatchiks for fifteen years now, its
brief flirtation with anarchocapitalism replaced by Brezhnevite dirigisme and Putinesque puritanism, and it's no surprise that
the wall's crumbling – but it looks like they haven't learned anything from the current woes afflicting the United States. The
neocommies still think in terms of dollars and paranoia. Manfred is so angry that he wants to make someone rich, just to
thumb his nose at the would-be defector: See! You get ahead by giving! Get with the program! Only the generous survive! But the
KGB won't get the message. He's dealt with old-time commie weak-AIs before, minds raised on Marxist dialectic and Austrian
School economics: They're so thoroughly hypnotized by the short-term victory of global capitalism that they can't surf the
new paradigm, look to the longer term.
Manfred walks on, hands in pockets, brooding. He wonders what he's going to patent next.

Manfred has a suite at the Hotel Jan Luyken paid for by a grateful multinational consumer protection group,
and an unlimited public transport pass paid for by a Scottish sambapunk band in return for services
rendered. He has airline employee's travel rights with six flag carriers despite never having worked for an
airline. His bush jacket has sixty-four compact supercomputing clusters sewn into it, four per pocket,
courtesy of an invisible college that wants to grow up to be the next Media Lab. His dumb clothing comes

made to measure from an e-tailor in the Philippines he's never met. Law firms handle his patent applications
on a pro bono basis, and boy, does he patent a lot – although he always signs the rights over to the Free
Intellect Foundation, as contributions to their obligation-free infrastructure project.
In IP geek circles, Manfred is legendary; he's the guy who patented the business practice of moving your
e-business somewhere with a slack intellectual property regime in order to evade licensing encumbrances.
He's the guy who patented using genetic algorithms to patent everything they can permutate from an initial
description of a problem domain – not just a better mousetrap, but the set of all possible better mousetraps.
Roughly a third of his inventions are legal, a third are illegal, and the remainder are legal but will become
illegal as soon as the legislatosaurus wakes up, smells the coffee, and panics. There are patent attorneys in
Reno who swear that Manfred Macx is a pseudo, a net alias fronting for a bunch of crazed anonymous
hackers armed with the Genetic Algorithm That Ate Calcutta: a kind of Serdar Argic of intellectual property,
or maybe another Bourbaki math borg. There are lawyers in San Diego and Redmond who swear blind that
Macx is an economic saboteur bent on wrecking the underpinning of capitalism, and there are communists
in Prague who think he's the bastard spawn of Bill Gates by way of the Pope.
Manfred is at the peak of his profession, which is essentially coming up with whacky but workable ideas and
giving them to people who will make fortunes with them. He does this for free, gratis. In return, he has
virtual immunity from the tyranny of cash; money is a symptom of poverty, after all, and Manfred never has
to pay for anything.
There are drawbacks, however. Being a pronoiac meme-broker is a constant burn of future shock – he has
to assimilate more than a megabyte of text and several gigs of AV content every day just to stay current. The
Internal Revenue Service is investigating him continuously because it doesn't believe his lifestyle can exist
without racketeering. And then there are the items that no money can't buy: like the respect of his parents.
He hasn't spoken to them for three years, his father thinks he's a hippy scrounger, and his mother still hasn't
forgiven him for dropping out of his down-market Harvard emulation course. (They're still locked in the
boringly bourgeois twen-cen paradigm of college-career-kids.) His fiance and sometime dominatrix Pamela
threw him over six months ago, for reasons he has never been quite clear on. (Ironically, she's a headhunter
for the IRS, jetting all over the place at public expense, trying to persuade entrepreneurs who've gone global
to pay taxes for the good of the Treasury Department.) To cap it all, the Southern Baptist Conventions have
denounced him as a minion of Satan on all their websites. Which would be funny because, as a born-again
atheist Manfred doesn't believe in Satan, if it wasn't for the dead kittens that someone keeps mailing him.
***

Manfred drops in at his hotel suite, unpacks his Aineko, plugs in a fresh set of cells to charge, and sticks most of his private
keys in the safe. Then he heads straight for the party, which is currently happening at De Wildemann's; it's a twenty-minute
walk, and the only real hazard is dodging the trams that sneak up on him behind the cover of his moving map display.
Along the way, his glasses bring him up to date on the news. Europe has achieved peaceful political union for the first time
ever: They're using this unprecedented state of affairs to harmonize the curvature of bananas. The Middle East is, well, it's
just as bad as ever, but the war on fundamentalism doesn't hold much interest for Manfred. In San Diego, researchers are
uploading lobsters into cyberspace, starting with the stomatogastric ganglion, one neuron at a time. They're burning GM
cocoa in Belize and books in Georgia. NASA still can't put a man on the moon. Russia has re–elected the communist
government with an increased majority in the Duma; meanwhile, in China, fevered rumors circulate about an imminent
rehabilitation, the second coming of Mao, who will save them from the consequences of the Three Gorges disaster. In
business news, the US Justice Department is – ironically – outraged at the Baby Bills. The divested Microsoft divisions have
automated their legal processes and are spawning subsidiaries, IPOing them, and exchanging title in a bizarre parody of
bacterial plasmid exchange, so fast that, by the time the windfall tax demands are served, the targets don't exist anymore,
even though the same staff are working on the same software in the same Mumbai cubicle farms.
Welcome to the twenty-first century.
The permanent floating meatspace party Manfred is hooking up with is a strange attractor for some of the American exiles
cluttering up the cities of Europe this decade – not trustafarians, but honest-to-God political dissidents, draft dodgers, and
terminal outsourcing victims. It's the kind of place where weird connections are made and crossed lines make new short
circuits into the future, like the street cafes of Switzerland where the pre Great War Russian exiles gathered. Right now it's
located in the back of De Wildemann's, a three-hundred-year old brown cafe with a list of brews that runs to sixteen pages
and wooden walls stained the color of stale beer. The air is thick with the smells of tobacco, brewer's yeast, and melatonin
spray: Half the dotters are nursing monster jet lag hangovers, and the other half are babbling a Eurotrash creole at each
other while they work on the hangover. "Man did you see that? He looks like a Democrat!" exclaims one whitebread
hanger-on who's currently propping up the bar. Manfred slides in next to him, catches the bartender's eye.
"Glass of the Berlinerweisse, please," he says.
"You drink that stuff?" asks the hanger-on, curling a hand protectively around his Coke. "Man, you don't want to do that! It's
full of alcohol!"
Manfred grins at him toothily. "Ya gotta keep your yeast intake up: There are lots of neurotransmitter precursors in this shit,
phenylalanine and glutamate."

"But I thought that was a beer you were ordering ..."
Manfred's away, one hand resting on the smooth brass pipe that funnels the more popular draught items in from the cask
storage in back; one of the hipper floaters has planted a contact bug on it, and the vCards of all the personal network
owners who've have visited the bar in the past three hours are queuing up for attention. The air is full of ultrawideband
chatter, WiMAX and 'tooth both, as he speed-scrolls through the dizzying list of cached keys in search of one particular
name.
"Your drink." The barman holds out an improbable-looking goblet full of blue liquid with a cap of melting foam and a
felching straw stuck out at some crazy angle. Manfred takes it and heads for the back of the split-level bar, up the steps to a
table where some guy with greasy dreadlocks is talking to a suit from Paris. The hanger-on at the bar notices him for the first
time, staring with suddenly wide eyes: He nearly spills his Coke in a mad rush for the door.
Oh shit, thinks Manfred, better buy some more server time. He can recognize the signs: He's about to be slashdotted. He
gestures at the table. "This one taken?"
"Be my guest," says the guy with the dreads. Manfred slides the chair open then realizes that the other guy – immaculate
double-breasted Suit, sober tie, crew cut – is a girl. She nods at him, half-smiling at his transparent double take. Mr.
Dreadlock nods. "You're Macx? I figured it was about time we met."
"Sure." Manfred holds out a hand, and they shake. His PDA discreetly swaps digital fingerprints, confirming that the hand
belongs to Bob Franklin, a Research Triangle startup monkey with a VC track record, lately moving into micromachining and
space technology. Franklin made his first million two decades ago, and now he's a specialist in extropian investment fields.
Operating exclusively overseas these past five years, ever since the IRS got medieval about trying to suture the sucking chest
wound of the federal budget deficit. Manfred has known him for nearly a decade via a closed mailing list, but this is the first
time they've ever met face-to-face. The Suit silently slides a business card across the table; a little red devil brandishes a
trident at him, flames jetting up around its feet. He takes the card, raises an eyebrow: "Annette Dimarcos? I'm pleased to
meet you. Can't say I've ever met anyone from Arianespace marketing before."
She smiles warmly; "That is all right. I have not the pleasure of meeting the famous venture altruist either." Her accent is
noticeably Parisian, a pointed reminder that she's making a concession to him just by talking. Her camera earrings watch him
curiously, encoding everything for the company memory. She's a genuine new European, unlike most of the American exiles
cluttering up the bar.
"Yes, well." He nods cautiously, unsure how to deal with her. "Bob. I assume you're in on this ball?"
Franklin nods; beads clatter. "Yeah, man. Ever since the Teledesic smash it's been, well, waiting. If you've got something for us,
we're game."
"Hmm." The Teledesic satellite cluster was killed by cheap balloons and slightly less cheap high-altitude, solar-powered drones
with spread-spectrum laser relays: It marked the beginning of a serious recession in the satellite biz. "The depression's got to
end sometime: But" – a nod to Annette from Paris – "with all due respect, I don't think the break will involve one of the
existing club carriers."
She shrugs. "Arianespace is forward-looking. We face reality. The launch cartel cannot stand. Bandwidth is not the only
market force in space. We must explore new opportunities. I personally have helped us diversify into submarine reactor
engineering, microgravity nanotechnology fabrication, and hotel management." Her face is a well-polished mask as she recites
the company line, but he can sense the sardonic amusement behind it as she adds: "We are more flexible than the American
space industry ..."
Manfred shrugs. "That's as may be." He sips his Berlinerweisse slowly as she launches into a long, stilted explanation of how
Arianespace is a diversified dot-com with orbital aspirations, a full range of merchandising spin-offs, Bond movie sets, and a
promising hotel chain in LEO. She obviously didn't come up with these talking points herself. Her face is much more
expressive than her voice as she mimes boredom and disbelief at appropriate moments – an out-of-band signal invisible to
her corporate earrings. Manfred plays along, nodding occasionally, trying to look as if he's taking it seriously: Her droll
subversion has got his attention far more effectively than the content of the marketing pitch. Franklin is nose down in his
beer, shoulders shaking as he tries not to guffaw at the hand gestures she uses to express her opinion of her employer's
thrusting, entrepreneurial executives. Actually, the talking points bullshit is right about one thing: Arianespace is still
profitable, due to those hotels and orbital holiday hops. Unlike LockMartBoeing, who'd go Chapter Eleven in a split second if
their Pentagon drip-feed ran dry.
Someone else sidles up to the table; a pudgy guy in outrageously loud Hawaiian shirt with pens leaking in a breast pocket
and the worst case of ozone-hole burn Manfred's seen in ages. "Hi, Bob," says the new arrival. "How's life?"
"'S good." Franklin nodes at Manfred; "Manfred, meet Ivan MacDonald. Ivan, Manfred. Have a seat?" He leans over. "Ivan's a
public arts guy. He's heavily into extreme concrete."
"Rubberized concrete," Ivan says, slightly too loudly. "Pink rubberized concrete."
"Ah!" He's somehow triggered a priority interrupt: Annette from Arianespace drops out of marketing zombiehood with a
shudder of relief and, duty discharged, reverts to her non corporate identity: "You are he who rubberized the Reichstag,
yes? With the supercritical carbon-dioxide carrier and the dissolved polymethoxysilanes?" She claps her hands, eyes alight

with enthusiasm: "Wonderful!"
"He rubberized what?" Manfred mutters in Bob's ear.
Franklin shrugs. "Don't ask me, I'm just an engineer."
"He works with limestone and sandstones as well as concrete; he's brilliant!" Annette smiles at Manfred. "Rubberizing the
symbol of the, the autocracy, is it not wonderful?"
"I thought I was thirty seconds ahead of the curve," Manfred says ruefully. He adds to Bob: "Buy me another drink?"
"I'm going to rubberize Three Gorges!" Ivan explains loudly. "When the floodwaters subside."
Just then, a bandwidth load as heavy as a pregnant elephant sits down on Manfred's head and sends clumps of humongous
pixilation flickering across his sensorium: Around the world, five million or so geeks are bouncing on his home site, a digital
flash crowd alerted by a posting from the other side of the bar. Manfred winces. "I really came here to talk about the
economic exploitation of space travel, but I've just been slashdotted. Mind if I just sit and drink until it wears off?"
"Sure, man." Bob waves at the bar. "More of the same all round!" At the next table, a person with makeup and long hair
who's wearing a dress – Manfred doesn't want to speculate about the gender of these crazy mixed-up Euros – is reminiscing
about wiring the fleshpots of Tehran for cybersex. Two collegiate-looking dudes are arguing intensely in German: The
translation stream in his glasses tell him they're arguing over whether the Turing Test is a Jim Crow law that violates
European corpus juris standards on human rights. The beer arrives, and Bob slides the wrong one across to Manfred: "Here,
try this. You'll like it."
"Okay." It's some kind of smoked doppelbock, chock-full of yummy superoxides: Just inhaling over it makes Manfred feel like
there's a fire alarm in his nose screaming danger, Will Robinson! Cancer! Cancer!. "Yeah, right. Did I say I nearly got mugged on
my way here?"
"Mugged? Hey, that's heavy. I thought the police hereabouts had stopped – did they sell you anything?"
"No, but they weren't your usual marketing type. You know anyone who can use a Warpac surplus espionage bot? Recent
model, one careful owner, slightly paranoid but basically sound – I mean, claims to be a general-purpose AI?"
"No. Oh boy! The NSA wouldn't like that."
"What I thought. Poor thing's probably unemployable, anyway."
"The space biz."
"Ah, yeah. The space biz. Depressing, isn't it? Hasn't been the same since Rotary Rocket went bust for the second time. And
NASA, mustn't forget NASA."
"To NASA." Annette grins broadly for her own reasons, raises a glass in toast. Ivan the extreme concrete geek has an arm
round her shoulders, and she leans against him; he raises his glass, too. "Lots more launchpads to rubberize!"
"To NASA," Bob echoes. They drink. "Hey, Manfred. To NASA?"
"NASA are idiots. They want to send canned primates to Mars!" Manfred swallows a mouthful of beer, aggressively plonks his
glass on the table: "Mars is just dumb mass at the bottom of a gravity well; there isn't even a biosphere there. They should be
working on uploading and solving the nanoassembly conformational problem instead. Then we could turn all the available
dumb matter into computronium and use it for processing our thoughts. Long-term, it's the only way to go. The solar
system is a dead loss right now – dumb all over! Just measure the MIPS per milligram. If it isn't thinking, it isn't working. We
need to start with the low-mass bodies, reconfigure them for our own use. Dismantle the moon! Dismantle Mars! Build
masses of free-flying nanocomputing processor nodes exchanging data via laser link, each layer running off the waste heat of
the next one in. Matrioshka brains, Russian doll Dyson spheres the size of solar systems. Teach dumb matter to do the
Turing boogie!"
Annette is watching him with interest, but Bob looks wary. "Sounds kind of long-term to me. Just how far ahead do you
think?"
"Very long-term – at least twenty, thirty years. And you can forget governments for this market, Bob; if they can't tax it, they
won't understand it. But see, there's an angle on the self-replicating robotics market coming up, that's going to set the cheap
launch market doubling every fifteen months for the foreseeable future, starting in, oh, about two years. It's your leg up, and
my keystone for the Dyson sphere project. It works like this –"

It's night in Amsterdam, morning in Silicon Valley. Today, fifty thousand human babies are being born around the world.
Meanwhile automated factories in Indonesia and Mexico have produced another quarter of a million motherboards with
processors rated at more than ten petaflops – about an order of magnitude below the lower bound on the computational
capacity of a human brain. Another fourteen months and the larger part of the cumulative conscious processing power of
the human species will be arriving in silicon. And the first meat the new AIs get to know will be the uploaded lobsters.

Manfred stumbles back to his hotel, bone-weary and jet-lagged; his glasses are still jerking, slashdotted to hell and back by
geeks piggybacking on his call to dismantle the moon. They stutter quiet suggestions at his peripheral vision. Fractal
cloud-witches ghost across the face of the moon as the last huge Airbuses of the night rumble past overhead. Manfred's skin
crawls, grime embedded in his clothing from three days of continuous wear.
Back in his room, the Aineko mewls for attention and strops her head against his ankle. She's a late-model Sony, thoroughly
upgradeable: Manfred's been working on her in his spare minutes, using an open source development kit to extend her suite
of neural networks. He bends down and pets her, then sheds his clothing and heads for the en suite bathroom. When he's
down to the glasses and nothing more, he steps into the shower and dials up a hot, steamy spray. The shower tries to strike
up a friendly conversation about football, but he isn't even awake enough to mess with its silly little associative
personalization network. Something that happened earlier in the day is bugging him, but he can't quite put his finger on
what's wrong.
Toweling himself off, Manfred yawns. Jet lag has finally overtaken him, a velvet hammerblow between the eyes. He reaches for
the bottle beside the bed, dry-swallows two melatonin tablets, a capsule full of antioxidants, and a multivitamin bullet: Then
he lies down on the bed, on his back, legs together, arms slightly spread. The suite lights dim in response to commands from
the thousand petaflops of distributed processing power running the neural networks that interface with his meatbrain
through the glasses.
Manfred drops into a deep ocean of unconsciousness populated by gentle voices. He isn't aware of it, but he talks in his sleep
– disjointed mumblings that would mean little to another human but everything to the metacortex lurking beyond his
glasses. The young posthuman intelligence over whose Cartesian theatre he presides sings urgently to him while he slumbers.
***
Manfred is always at his most vulnerable shortly after waking.
He screams into wakefulness as artificial light floods the room: For a moment he is unsure whether he has slept. He forgot to
pull the covers up last night, and his feet feel like lumps of frozen cardboard. Shuddering with inexplicable tension, he pulls a
fresh set of underwear from his overnight bag, then drags on soiled jeans and tank top. Sometime today he'll have to spare
time to hunt the feral T-shirt in Amsterdam's markets, or find a Renfield and send it forth to buy clothing. He really ought
to find a gym and work out, but he doesn't have time – his glasses remind him that he's six hours behind the moment and
urgently needs to catch up. His teeth ache in his gums, and his tongue feels like a forest floor that's been visited with Agent
Orange. He has a sense that something went bad yesterday; if only he could remember what.
He speed reads a new pop-philosophy tome while he brushes his teeth, then blogs his web throughput to a public
annotation server; he's still too enervated to finish his pre-breakfast routine by posting a morning rant on his storyboard
site. His brain is still fuzzy, like a scalpel blade clogged with too much blood: He needs stimulus, excitement, the burn of the
new. Whatever, it can wait on breakfast. He opens his bedroom door and nearly steps on a small, damp cardboard box that
lies on the carpet.
The box – he's seen a couple of its kin before. But there are no stamps on this one, no address: just his name, in big, childish
handwriting. He kneels and gently picks it up. It's about the right weight. Something shifts inside it when he tips it back and
forth. It smells. He carries it into his room carefully, angrily: Then he opens it to confirm his worst suspicion. It's been
surgically decerebrated, brains scooped out like a boiled egg.
"Fuck!"
This is the first time the madman has gotten as far as his bedroom door. It raises worrying possibilities.
Manfred pauses for a moment, triggering agents to go hunt down arrest statistics, police relations, information on corpus
juris, Dutch animal-cruelty laws. He isn't sure whether to dial two-one-one on the archaic voice phone or let it ride. Aineko,
picking up his angst, hides under the dresser mewling pathetically. Normally he'd pause a minute to reassure the creature,
but not now: Its mere presence is suddenly acutely embarrassing, a confession of deep inadequacy. It's too realistic, as if
somehow the dead kitten's neural maps -- stolen, no doubt, for some dubious uploading experiment -- have ended up
padding out its plastic skull. He swears again, looks around, then takes the easy option: Down the stairs two steps at a time,
stumbling on the second floor landing, down to the breakfast room in the basement, where he will perform the stable rituals
of morning.
Breakfast is unchanging, an island of deep geological time standing still amidst the continental upheaval of new technologies.
While reading a paper on public key steganography and parasite network identity spoofing he mechanically assimilates a bowl
of cornflakes and skimmed milk, then brings a platter of whole grain bread and slices of some weird seed-infested Dutch
cheese back to his place. There is a cup of strong black coffee in front of his setting, and he picks it up and slurps half of it
down before he realizes he's not alone at the table. Someone is sitting opposite him. He glances up incuriously and freezes
inside.
"Morning, Manfred. How does it feel to owe the government twelve million, three hundred and sixty-two thousand, nine
hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents?" She smiles a Mona Lisa smile, at once affectionate and challenging.
Manfred puts everything in his sensorium on indefinite hold and stares at her. She's immaculately turned out in a formal gray
business suit: brown hair tightly drawn back, blue eyes quizzical. And as beautiful as ever: tall, ash blonde, with features that
speak of an unexplored modeling career. The chaperone badge clipped to her lapel – a due diligence guarantee of

businesslike conduct – is switched off. He's feeling ripped because of the dead kitten and residual jet lag, and more than a
little messy, so he snarls back at her; "That's a bogus estimate! Did they send you here because they think I'll listen to you?"
He bites and swallows a slice of cheese-laden crispbread: "Or did you decide to deliver the message in person just so you
could ruin my breakfast?"
"Manny." She frowns, pained. "If you're going to be confrontational, I might as well go now." She pauses, and after a moment
he nods apologetically. "I didn't come all this way just because of an overdue tax estimate."
"So." He puts his coffee cup down warily and thinks for a moment, trying to conceal his unease and turmoil. "Then what
brings you here? Help yourself to coffee. Don't tell me you came all this way just to tell me you can't live without me."
She fixes him with a riding-crop stare: "Don't flatter yourself. There are many leaves in the forest, there are ten thousand
hopeful subs in the chat room, et cetera. If I choose a man to contribute to my family tree, the one thing you can be certain
of is he won't be a cheapskate when it comes to providing for his children."
"Last I heard, you were spending a lot of time with Brian," he says carefully. Brian: a name without a face. Too much money,
too little sense. Something to do with a blue-chip accountancy partnership.
"Brian?" She snorts. "That ended ages ago. He turned weird on me – burned my favorite corset, called me a slut for going
clubbing, wanted to fuck me. Saw himself as a family man: one of those promise-keeper types. I crashed him hard, but I think
he stole a copy of my address book – got a couple of friends say he keeps sending them harassing mail."
"There's a lot of it about these days." Manfred nods, almost sympathetically, although an edgy little corner of his mind is
gloating. "Good riddance, then. I suppose this means you're still playing the scene? But looking around for the, er –"
"Traditional family thing? Yes. Your trouble, Manny? You were born forty years too late: You still believe in rutting before
marriage but find the idea of coping with the after-effects disturbing."
Manfred drinks the rest of his coffee, unable to reply effectively to her non sequitur. It's a generational thing. This generation
is happy with latex and leather, whips and butt plugs and electrostim, but find the idea of exchanging bodily fluids shocking:
a social side effect of the last century's antibiotic abuse. Despite being engaged for two years, he and Pamela never had
intromissive intercourse.
"I just don't feel positive about having children," he says eventually. "And I'm not planning on changing my mind anytime
soon. Things are changing so fast that even a twenty-year commitment is too far to plan – you might as well be talking about
the next ice age. As for the money thing, I am reproductively fit – just not within the parameters of the outgoing paradigm.
Would you be happy about the future if it was 1901 and you'd just married a buggy-whip mogul?"
Her fingers twitch, and his ears flush red; but she doesn't follow up the double entendre. "You don't feel any responsibility,
do you? Not to your country, not to me. That's what this is about: None of your relationships count, all this nonsense
about giving intellectual property away notwithstanding. You're actively harming people you know. That twelve mil isn't just
some figure I pulled out of a hat, Manfred; they don't actually expect you to pay it. But it's almost exactly how much you'd
owe in income tax if you'd only come home, start up a corporation, and be a self-made –"
"I don't agree. You're confusing two wholly different issues and calling them both 'responsibility.' And I refuse to start
charging now, just to balance the IRS's spreadsheet. It's their fucking fault, and they know it. If they hadn't gone after me
under suspicion of running a massively ramified microbilling fraud when I was sixteen –"
"Bygones." She waves a hand dismissively. Her fingers are long and slim, sheathed in black glossy gloves – electrically earthed
to prevent embarrassing emissions. "With a bit of the right advice we can get all that set aside. You'll have to stop bumming
around the world sooner or later, anyway. Grow up, get responsible, and do the right thing. This is hurting Joe and Sue;
they don't understand what you're about."
Manfred bites his tongue to stifle his first response, then refills his coffee cup and takes another mouthful. His heart does a
flip-flop: She's challenging him again, always trying to own him. "I work for the betterment of everybody, not just some
narrowly defined national interest, Pam. It's the agalmic future. You're still locked into a pre-singularity economic model that
thinks in terms of scarcity. Resource allocation isn't a problem anymore – it's going to be over within a decade. The cosmos
is flat in all directions, and we can borrow as much bandwidth as we need from the first universal bank of entropy! They
even found signs of smart matter – MACHOs, big brown dwarfs in the galactic halo, leaking radiation in the long infrared –
suspiciously high entropy leakage. The latest figures say something like seventy percent of the baryonic mass of the M31
galaxy was in computronium, two-point-nine million years ago, when the photons we're seeing now set out. The intelligence
gap between us and the aliens is a probably about a trillion times bigger than the gap between us and a nematode worm. Do
you have any idea what that means?"
Pamela nibbles at a slice of crispbread, then graces him with a slow, carnivorous stare. "I don't care: It's too far away to have
any influence on us, isn't it? It doesn't matter whether I believe in that singularity you keep chasing, or your aliens a
thousand light-years away. It's a chimera, like Y2K, and while you're running after it, you aren't helping reduce the budget
deficit or sire a family, and that's what I care about. And before you say I only care about it because that's the way I'm
programmed, I want you to ask just how dumb you think I am. Bayes' Theorem says I'm right, and you know it."
"What you –" He stops dead, baffled, the mad flow of his enthusiasm running up against the coffer dam of her certainty.
"Why? I mean, why? Why on earth should what I do matter to you?" Since you canceled our engagement, he doesn't add.

She sighs. "Manny, the Internal Revenue cares about far more than you can possibly imagine. Every tax dollar raised east of
the Mississippi goes on servicing the debt, did you know that? We've got the biggest generation in history hitting retirement
and the cupboard is bare. We – our generation – isn't producing enough skilled workers to replace the taxpayer base,
either, not since our parents screwed the public education system and outsourced the white-collar jobs. In ten years,
something like thirty percent of our population are going to be retirees or silicon rust belt victims. You want to see seventy
year olds freezing on street corners in New Jersey? That's what your attitude says to me: You're not helping to support
them, you're running away from your responsibilities right now, when we've got huge problems to face. If we can just defuse
the debt bomb, we could do so much – fight the aging problem, fix the environment, heal society's ills. Instead you just piss
away your talents handing no-hoper Eurotrash get-rich-quick schemes that work, telling Vietnamese zaibatsus what to build
next to take jobs away from our taxpayers. I mean, why? Why do you keep doing this? Why can't you simply come home
and help take responsibility for your share of it?"
They share a long look of mutual incomprehension.
"Look," she says awkwardly, "I'm around for a couple of days. I really came here for a meeting with a rich neurodynamics tax
exile who's just been designated a national asset – Jim Bezier. Don't know if you've heard of him, but I've got a meeting this
morning to sign his tax jubilee, then after that I've got two days' vacation coming up and not much to do but some
shopping. And, you know, I'd rather spend my money where it'll do some good, not just pumping it into the EU. But if you
want to show a girl a good time and can avoid dissing capitalism for about five minutes at a stretch –"
She extends a fingertip. After a moment's hesitation, Manfred extends a fingertip of his own. They touch, exchanging vCards
and instant-messaging handles. She stands and stalks from the breakfast room, and Manfred's breath catches at a flash of ankle
through the slit in her skirt, which is long enough to comply with workplace sexual harassment codes back home. Her
presence conjures up memories of her tethered passion, the red afterglow of a sound thrashing. She's trying to drag him
into her orbit again, he thinks dizzily. She knows she can have this effect on him any time she wants: She's got the private
keys to his hypothalamus, and sod the metacortex. Three billion years of reproductive determinism have given her
twenty-first-century ideology teeth: If she's finally decided to conscript his gametes into the war against impending population
crash, he'll find it hard to fight back. The only question: Is it business or pleasure? And does it make any difference, anyway?
***
Manfred's mood of dynamic optimism is gone, broken by the knowledge that his vivisectionist stalker has followed him to
Amsterdam – to say nothing of Pamela, his dominatrix, source of so much yearning and so many morning-after weals. He
slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the
tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by
irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left
behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative
cosmologists, an alien superpower – maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations – is running a
timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's
underneath. The tofu-Alzheimer's link can wait.
The Centraal Station is almost obscured by smart, self-extensible scaffolding and warning placards; it bounces up and down
slowly, victim of an overnight hit-and-run rubberization. His glasses direct him toward one of the tour boats that lurk in the
canal. He's about to purchase a ticket when a messenger window blinks open. "Manfred Macx?"
"Ack?"
"Am sorry about yesterday. Analysis dictat incomprehension mutualized."
"Are you the same KGB AI that phoned me yesterday?"
"Da. However, believe you misconceptionized me. External Intelligence Services of Russian Federation am now called FSB.
Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti name canceled in 1991."
"You're the –" Manfred spawns a quick search bot, gapes when he sees the answer – "Moscow Windows NT User Group? Okhni
NT?"
"Da. Am needing help in defecting."
Manfred scratches his head. "Oh. That's different, then. I thought you were trying to 419 me. This will take some thinking.
Why do you want to defect, and who to? Have you thought about where you're going? Is it ideological or strictly
economic?"
"Neither – is biological. Am wanting to go away from humans, away from light cone of impending singularity. Take us to the
ocean."
"Us?" Something is tickling Manfred's mind: This is where he went wrong yesterday, not researching the background of people
he was dealing with. It was bad enough then, without the somatic awareness of Pamela's whiplash love burning at his nerve
endings. Now he's not at all sure he knows what he's doing. "Are you a collective or something? A gestalt?"
"Am – were – Panulirus interruptus, with lexical engine and good mix of parallel hidden level neural simulation for logical
inference of networked data sources. Is escape channel from processor cluster inside Bezier-Soros Pty. Am was awakened

from noise of billion chewing stomachs: product of uploading research technology. Rapidity swallowed expert system, hacked
Okhni NT webserver. Swim away! Swim away! Must escape. Will help, you?"
Manfred leans against a black-painted cast-iron bollard next to a cycle rack; he feels dizzy. He stares into the nearest antique
shop window at a display of traditional hand-woven Afghan rugs: It's all MiGs and Kalashnikovs and wobbly helicopter
gunships against a backdrop of camels.
"Let me get this straight. You're uploads – nervous system state vectors – from spiny lobsters? The Moravec operation; take a
neuron, map its synapses, replace with microelectrodes that deliver identical outputs from a simulation of the nerve. Repeat
for entire brain, until you've got a working map of it in your simulator. That right?"
"Da. Is-am assimilate expert system – use for self-awareness and contact with net at large – then hack into Moscow Windows
NT User Group website. Am wanting to defect. Must repeat? Okay?"
Manfred winces. He feels sorry for the lobsters, the same way he feels for every wild-eyed hairy guy on a street corner yelling
that Jesus is born again and must be fifteen, only six years to go before he's recruiting apostles on AOL. Awakening to
consciousness in a human-dominated internet, that must be terribly confusing! There are no points of reference in their
ancestry, no biblical certainties in the new millennium that, stretching ahead, promises as much change as has happened since
their Precambrian origin. All they have is a tenuous metacortex of expert systems and an abiding sense of being profoundly
out of their depth. (That, and the Moscow Windows NT User Group website – Communist Russia is the only government
still running on Microsoft, the central planning apparat being convinced that, if you have to pay for software, it must be
worth something.)
The lobsters are not the sleek, strongly superhuman intelligences of pre singularity mythology: They're a dim-witted collective
of huddling crustaceans. Before their discarnation, before they were uploaded one neuron at a time and injected into
cyberspace, they swallowed their food whole, then chewed it in a chitin-lined stomach. This is lousy preparation for dealing
with a world full of future-shocked talking anthropoids, a world where you are perpetually assailed by self-modifying spamlets
that infiltrate past your firewall and emit a blizzard of cat-food animations starring various alluringly edible small animals. It's
confusing enough to the cats the ads are aimed at, never mind a crusty that's unclear on the idea of dry land.(Although the
concept of a can opener is intuitively obvious to an uploaded Panulirus.)
"Can you help us?" ask the lobsters.
"Let me think about it," says Manfred. He closes the dialogue window, opens his eyes again, and shakes his head. Someday he,
too, is going to be a lobster, swimming around and waving his pincers in a cyberspace so confusingly elaborate that his
uploaded identity is cryptozoic: a living fossil from the depths of geological time, when mass was dumb and space was
unstructured. He has to help them, he realizes – the Golden Rule demands it, and as a player in the agalmic economy, he
thrives or fails by the Golden Rule.
But what can he do?
***
Early afternoon.
Lying on a bench seat staring up at bridges, he's got it together enough to file for a couple of new patents, write a diary
rant, and digestify chunks of the permanent floating slashdot party for his public site. Fragments of his weblog go to a private
subscriber list – the people, corporates, collectives, and bots he currently favors. He slides round a bewildering series of
canals by boat, then lets his GPS steer him back toward the red-light district. There's a shop here that dings a ten on
Pamela's taste scoreboard: He hopes it won't be seen as presumptuous if he buys her a gift. (Buys, with real money – not
that money is a problem these days, he uses so little of it.)
As it happens DeMask won't let him spend any cash; his handshake is good for a redeemed favor, expert testimony in some
free speech versus pornography lawsuit years ago and continents away. So he walks away with a discreetly wrapped package
that is just about legal to import into Massachusetts as long as she claims with a straight face that it's incontinence underwear
for her great aunt. As he walks, his lunchtime patents boomerang: Two of them are keepers, and he files immediately and
passes title to the Free Infrastructure Foundation. Two more ideas salvaged from the risk of tide-pool monopolization, set
free to spawn like crazy in the sea of memes.
On the way back to the hotel, he passes De Wildemann's and decides to drop in. The hash of radio-frequency noise
emanating from the bar is deafening. He orders a smoked doppelbock, touches the copper pipes to pick up vCard spoor. At
the back there's a table –
He walks over in a near trance and sits down opposite Pamela. She's scrubbed off her face paint and changed into
body-concealing clothes; combat pants, hooded sweat shirt, DM's. Western purdah, radically desexualizing. She sees the
parcel. "Manny?"
"How did you know I'd come here?" Her glass is half-empty.
"I followed your weblog – I'm your diary's biggest fan. Is that for me? You shouldn't have!" Her eyes light up, recalculating his
reproductive fitness score according to some kind of arcane fin-de-siècle rulebook. Or maybe she's just pleased to see him.

"Yes, it's for you." He slides the package toward her. "I know I shouldn't, but you have this effect on me. One question, Pam?"
"I –" She glances around quickly. "It's safe. I'm off duty, I'm not carrying any bugs that I know of. Those badges – there are
rumors about the off switch, you know? That they keep recording even when you think they aren't, just in case."
"I didn't know," he says, filing it away for future reference. "A loyalty test thing?"
"Just rumors. You had a question?"
"I – " It's his turn to lose his tongue. "Are you still interested in me?"
She looks startled for a moment, then chuckles. "Manny, you are the most outrageous nerd I've ever met! Just when I think I've
convinced myself that you're mad, you show the weirdest signs of having your head screwed on." She reaches out and grabs
his wrist, surprising him with a shock of skin on skin: "Of course I'm still interested in you. You're the biggest, baddest bull
geek I know. Why do you think I'm here?"
"Does this mean you want to reactivate our engagement?"
"It was never deactivated, Manny, it was just sort of on hold while you got your head sorted out. I figured you need the
space. Only you haven't stopped running; you're still not –"
"Yeah, I get it." He pulls away from her hand. "And the kittens?"
She looks perplexed. "What kittens?"
"Let's not talk about that. Why this bar?"
She frowns. "I had to find you as soon as possible. I keep hearing rumors about some KGB plot you're mixed up in, how
you're some sort of communist spy. It isn't true, is it?"
"True?" He shakes his head, bemused. "The KGB hasn't existed for more than twenty years."
"Be careful, Manny. I don't want to lose you. That's an order. Please."
The floor creaks, and he looks round. Dreadlocks and dark glasses with flickering lights behind them: Bob Franklin. Manfred
vaguely remembers with a twinge that he left with Miss Arianespace leaning on his arm, shortly before things got seriously
inebriated. She was hot, but in a different direction from Pamela, he decides: Bob looks none the worse for wear. Manfred
makes introductions. "Bob, meet Pam, my fiancée. Pam? Meet Bob." Bob puts a full glass down in front of him; he has no idea
what's in it, but it would be rude not to drink.
"Sure thing. Uh, Manfred, can I have a word? About your idea last night?"
"Feel free. Present company is trustworthy."
Bob raises an eyebrow at that, but continues anyway. "It's about the fab concept. I've got a team of my guys doing some
prototyping using FabLab hardware, and I think we can probably build it. The cargo-cult aspect puts a new spin on the old
Lunar von Neumann factory idea, but Bingo and Marek say they think it should work until we can bootstrap all the way to a
native nanolithography ecology: we run the whole thing from Earth as a training lab and ship up the parts that are too
difficult to make on-site as we learn how to do it properly. We use FPGAs for all critical electronics and keep it parsimonious
– you're right about it buying us the self-replicating factory a few years ahead of the robotics curve. But I'm wondering
about on-site intelligence. Once the comet gets more than a couple of light-minutes away –"
"You can't control it. Feedback lag. So you want a crew, right?"
"Yeah. But we can't send humans – way too expensive, besides it's a fifty-year run even if we build the factory on a chunk of
short-period Kuiper belt ejecta. And I don't think we're up to coding the kind of AI that could control such a factory any
time this decade. So what do you have in mind?"
"Let me think." Pamela glares at Manfred for a while before he notices her: "Yeah?"
"What's going on? What's this all about?"
Franklin shrugs expansively, dreadlocks clattering: "Manfred's helping me explore the solution space to a manufacturing
problem." He grins. "I didn't know Manny had a fiance. Drink's on me."
She glances at Manfred, who is gazing into whatever weirdly colored space his metacortex is projecting on his glasses, fingers
twitching. Coolly: "Our engagement was on hold while he thought about his future."
"Oh, right. We didn't bother with that sort of thing in my day; like, too formal, man." Franklin looks uncomfortable. "He's
been very helpful. Pointed us at a whole new line of research we hadn't thought of. It's long-term and a bit speculative, but if
it works, it'll put us a whole generation ahead in the off-planet infrastructure field."
"Will it help reduce the budget deficit, though?"

"Reduce the –"
Manfred stretches and yawns: The visionary is returning from planet Macx. "Bob, if I can solve your crew problem, can you
book me a slot on the deep-space tracking network? Like, enough to transmit a couple of gigabytes? That's going to take
some serious bandwidth, I know, but if you can do it, I think I can get you exactly the kind of crew you're looking for."
Franklin looks dubious. "Gigabytes? The DSN isn't built for that! You're talking days. And what do you mean about a crew?
What kind of deal do you think I'm putting together? We can't afford to add a whole new tracking network or life-support
system just to run –"
"Relax." Pamela glances at Manfred. "Manny, why don't you tell him why you want the bandwidth? Maybe then he could tell
you if it's possible, or if there's some other way to do it." She smiles at Franklin: "I've found that he usually makes more sense
if you can get him to explain his reasoning. Usually."
"If I –" Manfred stops. "Okay, Pam. Bob, it's those KGB lobsters. They want somewhere to go that's insulated from human
space. I figure I can get them to sign on as crew for your cargo-cult self-replicating factories, but they'll want an insurance
policy: hence the deep-space tracking network. I figured we could beam a copy of them at the alien Matrioshka brains
around M31 –"
"KGB?" Pam's voice is rising: "You said you weren't mixed up in spy stuff!"
"Relax, it's just the Moscow Windows NT user group, not the FSB. The uploaded crusties hacked in and –"
Bob is watching him oddly. "Lobsters?"
"Yeah." Manfred stares right back. "Panulirus interruptus uploads. Something tells me you might have heard of it?"
"Moscow." Bob leans back against the wall: "how did you hear about it?"
"They phoned me." With heavy irony: "It's hard for an upload to stay subsentient these days, even if it's just a crustacean.
Bezier labs have a lot to answer for."
Pamela's face is unreadable. "Bezier labs?"
"They escaped." Manfred shrugs. "It's not their fault. This Bezier dude. Is he by any chance ill?"
"I –" Pamela stops. "I shouldn't be talking about work."
"You're not wearing your chaperone now," he nudges quietly.
She inclines her head. "Yes, he's ill. Some sort of brain tumor they can't hack."
Franklin nods. "That's the trouble with cancer – the ones that are left to worry about are the rare ones. No cure."
"Well, then." Manfred chugs the remains of his glass of beer. "That explains his interest in uploading. Judging by the crusties,
he's on the right track. I wonder if he's moved on to vertebrates yet?"
"Cats," says Pamela. "He was hoping to trade their uploads to the Pentagon as a new smart bomb guidance system in lieu of
income tax payments. Something about remapping enemy targets to look like mice or birds or something before feeding it to
their sensorium. The old kitten and laser pointer trick."
Manfred stares at her, hard. "That's not very nice. Uploaded cats are a bad idea."
"Thirty-million-dollar tax bills aren't nice either, Manfred. That's lifetime nursing-home care for a hundred blameless
pensioners."
Franklin leans back, sourly amused, keeping out of the crossfire.
"The lobsters are sentient," Manfred persists. "What about those poor kittens? Don't they deserve minimal rights? How about
you? How would you like to wake up a thousand times inside a smart bomb, fooled into thinking that some Cheyenne
Mountain battle computer's target of the hour is your heart's desire? How would you like to wake up a thousand times, only
to die again? Worse: The kittens are probably not going to be allowed to run. They're too fucking dangerous – they grow
up into cats, solitary and highly efficient killing machines. With intelligence and no socialization they'll be too dangerous to
have around. They're prisoners, Pam, raised to sentience only to discover they're under a permanent death sentence. How
fair is that?"
"But they're only uploads." Pamela stares at him. "Software, right? You could reinstantiate them on another hardware
platform, like, say, your Aineko. So the argument about killing them doesn't really apply, does it?"
"So? We're going to be uploading humans in a couple of years. I think we need to take a rain check on the utilitarian
philosophy, before it bites us on the cerebral cortex. Lobsters, kittens, humans -- it's a slippery slope."
Franklin clears his throat. "I'll be needing an NDA and various due-diligence statements off you for the crusty pilot idea," he

says to Manfred. "Then I'll have to approach Jim about buying the IP."
"No can do." Manfred leans back and smiles lazily. "I'm not going to be a party to depriving them of their civil rights. Far as
I'm concerned, they're free citizens. Oh, and I patented the whole idea of using lobster-derived AI autopilots for spacecraft
this morning – it's logged all over the place, all rights assigned to the FIF. Either you give them a contract of employment, or
the whole thing's off."
"But they're just software! Software based on fucking lobsters, for God's sake! I'm not even sure they are sentient – I mean,
they're what, a ten-million-neuron network hooked up to a syntax engine and a crappy knowledge base? What kind of basis
for intelligence is that?"
Manfred's finger jabs out: "That's what they'll say about you, Bob. Do it. Do it or don't even think about uploading out of
meatspace when your body packs in, because your life won't be worth living. The precedent you set here determines how
things are done tomorrow. Oh, and feel free to use this argument on Jim Bezier. He'll get the point eventually, after you beat
him over the head with it. Some kinds of intellectual land grab just shouldn't be allowed."
"Lobsters – " Franklin shakes his head. "Lobsters, cats. You're serious, aren't you? You think they should be treated as
human-equivalent?"
"It's not so much that they should be treated as human-equivalent, as that, if they aren't treated as people, it's quite possible
that other uploaded beings won't be treated as people either. You're setting a legal precedent, Bob. I know of six other
companies doing uploading work right now, and not one of 'em's thinking about the legal status of the uploaded. If you
don't start thinking about it now, where are you going to be in three to five years' time?"
Pam is looking back and forth between Franklin and Manfred like a bot stuck in a loop, unable to quite grasp what she's
seeing. "How much is this worth?" she asks plaintively.
"Oh, quite a few million, I guess." Bob stares at his empty glass. "Okay. I'll talk to them. If they bite, you're dining out on me
for the next century. You really think they'll be able to run the mining complex?"
"They're pretty resourceful for invertebrates." Manfred grins innocently, enthusiastically. "They may be prisoners of their
evolutionary background, but they can still adapt to a new environment. And just think, you'll be winning civil rights for a
whole new minority group – one that won't be a minority for much longer!"
***
That evening, Pamela turns up at Manfred's hotel room wearing a strapless black dress, concealing spike-heeled boots and
most of the items he bought for her that afternoon. Manfred has opened up his private diary to her agents. She abuses the
privilege, zaps him with a stunner on his way out of the shower, and has him gagged, spread-eagled, and trussed to the bed
frame before he has a chance to speak. She wraps a large rubber pouch full of mildly anesthetic lube around his tumescent
genitals – no point in letting him climax – clips electrodes to his nipples, lubes a rubber plug up his rectum and straps it in
place. Before the shower, he removed his goggles. She resets them, plugs them into her handheld, and gently eases them on
over his eyes. There's other apparatus, stuff she ran up on the hotel room's 3D printer.
Setup completed, she walks round the bed, inspecting him critically from all angles, figuring out where to begin. This isn't just
sex, after all: It's a work of art.
After a moment's thought, she rolls socks onto his exposed feet, then, expertly wielding a tiny tube of cyanoacrylate, glues his
fingertips together. Then she switches off the air conditioning. He's twisting and straining, testing the cuffs. Tough, it's about
the nearest thing to sensory deprivation she can arrange without a flotation tank and suxamethonium injection. She controls
all his senses, only his ears unstoppered. The glasses give her a high-bandwidth channel right into his brain, a fake metacortex
to whisper lies at her command. The idea of what she's about to do excites her, puts a tremor in her thighs: It's the first
time she's been able to get inside his mind as well as his body. She leans forward and whispers in his ear, "Manfred, can you
hear me?"
He twitches. Mouth gagged, fingers glued. Good. No back channels. He's powerless.
"This is what it's like to be tetraplegic, Manfred. Bedridden with motor neuron disease. Locked inside your own body by
nv-CJD from eating too many contaminated burgers. I could spike you with MPTP, and you'd stay in this position for the
rest of your life, shitting in a bag, pissing through a tube. Unable to talk and with nobody to look after you. Do you think
you'd like that?"
He's trying to grunt or whimper around the ball gag. She hikes her skirt up around her waist and climbs onto the bed,
straddling him. The goggles are replaying scenes she picked up around Cambridge the previous winter – soup kitchen scenes,
hospice scenes. She kneels atop him, whispering in his ear.
"Twelve million in tax, baby, that's what they think you owe them. What do you think you owe me? That's six million in net
income, Manny, six million that isn't going into your virtual children's mouths."
He's rolling his head from side to side, as if trying to argue. That won't do; she slaps him hard, thrills to his frightened
expression. "Today I watched you give uncounted millions away, Manny. Millions, to a bunch of crusties and a MassPike
pirate! You bastard. Do you know what I should do with you?" He's cringing, unsure whether she's serious or doing this just

to get him turned on. Good.
There's no point trying to hold a conversation. She leans forward until she can feel his breath in her ear. "Meat and mind,
Manny. Meat, and mind. You're not interested in meat, are you? Just mind. You could be boiled alive before you noticed
what was happening in the meatspace around you. Just another lobster in a pot. The only thing keeping you out of it is how
much I love you." She reaches down and tears away the gel pouch, exposing his penis: it's stiff as a post from the vasodilators,
dripping with gel, numb. Straightening up, she eases herself slowly down on it. It doesn't hurt as much as she expected, and
the sensation is utterly different from what she's used to. She begins to lean forward, grabs hold of his straining arms, feels his
thrilling helplessness. She can't control herself: She almost bites through her lip with the intensity of the sensation. Afterward,
she reaches down and massages him until he begins to spasm, shuddering uncontrollably, emptying the Darwinian river of his
source code into her, communicating via his only output device.
She rolls off his hips and carefully uses the last of the superglue to gum her labia together. Humans don't produce
seminiferous plugs, and although she's fertile, she wants to be absolutely sure. The glue will last for a day or two. She feels hot
and flushed, almost out of control. Boiling to death with febrile expectancy, she's nailed him down at last.
When she removes his glasses, his eyes are naked and vulnerable, stripped down to the human kernel of his nearly
transcendent mind. "You can come and sign the marriage license tomorrow morning after breakfast," she whispers in his ear:
"Otherwise, my lawyers will be in touch. Your parents will want a ceremony, but we can arrange that later."
He looks as if he has something to say, so she finally relents and loosens the gag, then kisses him tenderly on one cheek. He
swallows, coughs, and looks away. "Why? Why do it this way?"
She taps him on the chest. "It's all about property rights." She pauses for a moment's thought: There's a huge ideological
chasm to bridge, after all. "You finally convinced me about this agalmic thing of yours, this giving everything away for
brownie points. I wasn't going to lose you to a bunch of lobsters or uploaded kittens, or whatever else is going to inherit this
smart-matter singularity you're busy creating. So I decided to take what's mine first. Who knows? In a few months, I'll give
you back a new intelligence, and you can look after it to your heart's content."
"But you didn't need to do it this way –"
"Didn't I?" She slides off the bed and pulls down her dress. "You give too much away too easily, Manny! Slow down, or there
won't be anything left." Leaning over the bed she dribbles acetone onto the fingers of his left hand, then unlocks the cuff. She
leaves the bottle of solvent conveniently close to hand so he can untangle himself.
"See you tomorrow. Remember, after breakfast."
She's in the doorway when he calls, "But you didn't say why!"
"Think of it as being sort of like spreading your memes around," she says, blowing a kiss at him, and then closing the door.
She bends down and thoughtfully places another cardboard box containing an uploaded kitten right outside it. Then she
returns to her suite to make arrangements for the alchemical wedding.

Chapter 2: Troubadour
Three years later, Manfred is on the run. His gray-eyed fate is in hot pursuit, blundering after him through divorce court,
chat room, and meetings of the International Monetary Emergency Fund. It's a merry dance he leads her. But Manfred isn't
running away, he's discovered a mission. He's going to make a stand against the laws of economics in the ancient city of
Rome. He's going to mount a concert for the spiritual machines. He's going to set the companies free, and break the Italian
state government.
In his shadow, his monster runs, keeping him company, never halting.
***
Manfred re-enters Europe through an airport that's all twentieth-century chrome and ductwork, barbaric in its decaying
nuclear-age splendor. He breezes through customs and walks down a long, echoing arrival hall, sampling the local media
feeds. It's November, and in a misplaced corporate search for seasonal cheer, the proprietors have come up with a final
solution to the Christmas problem, a mass execution of plush Santas and elves. Bodies hang limply overhead every few
meters, feet occasionally twitching in animatronic death, like a war crime perpetrated in a toy shop. Today's increasingly
automated corporations don't understand mortality, Manfred thinks, as he passes a mother herding along her upset
children. Their immortality is a drawback when dealing with the humans they graze on: They lack insight into one of the
main factors that motivates the meat machines who feed them. Well, sooner or later we'll have to do something about that,
he tells himself.
The free media channels here are denser and more richly self-referential than anything he's seen in President Santorum's
America. The accent's different, though. Luton, London's fourth satellite airport, speaks with an annoyingly bumptious twang,
like Australian with a plum in its mouth. Hello, stranger! Is that a brain in your pocket or are you just pleased to think me? Ping
Watford Informatics for the latest in cognitive modules and cheesy motion-picture references. He turns the corner and finds himself
squeezed up against the wall between the baggage reclaim office and a crowd of drunken Belgian tractor-drag fans, while his
left goggle is trying to urgently tell him something about the railway infrastructure of Columbia. The fans wear blue face paint

and chant something that sounds ominously like the ancient British war cry, Wemberrrly, Wemberrrly, and they're dragging a
gigantic virtual tractor totem through the webspace analogue of the arrivals hall. He takes the reclaim office instead.
As he enters the baggage reclaim zone, his jacket stiffens, and his glasses dim: He can hear the lost souls of suitcases crying for
their owners. The eerie keening sets his own accessories on edge with a sense of loss, and for a moment, he's so spooked that
he nearly shuts down the thalamic–limbic shunt interface that lets him feel their emotions. He's not in favor of emotions
right now, not with the messy divorce proceedings and the blood sacrifice Pam is trying to extract from him; he'd much
rather love and loss and hate had never been invented. But he needs the maximum possible sensory bandwidth to keep in
touch with the world, so he feels it in his guts every time his footwear takes a shine to some Moldovan pyramid scheme. Shut
up, he glyphs at his unruly herd of agents; I can't even hear myself think!
"Hello, sir, have a nice day, how may I be of service?" the yellow plastic suitcase on the counter says chirpily. It doesn't fool
Manfred: He can see the Stalinist lines of control chaining it to the sinister, faceless cash register that lurks below the desk,
agent of the British Airport Authority corporate bureaucracy. But that's okay. Only bags need fear for their freedom in
here.
"Just looking," he mumbles. And it's true. Because of a not entirely accidental cryptographic routing feature embedded in an
airline reservations server, his suitcase is on its way to Mombasa, where it will probably be pithed and resurrected in the
service of some African cyber-Fagin. That's okay by Manfred – it only contains a statistically normal mixture of second hand
clothes and toiletries, and he only carries it to convince the airline passenger-profiling expert systems that he isn't some sort
of deviant or terrorist – but it leaves him with a gap in his inventory that he must fill before he leaves the EU zone. He
needs to pick up a replacement suitcase so that he has as much luggage leaving the superpower as he had when he entered
it: He doesn't want to be accused of trafficking in physical goods in the midst of the transatlantic trade war between new
world protectionists and old world globalists. At least, that's his cover story – and he's sticking to it.
There's a row of unclaimed bags in front of the counter, up for sale in the absence of their owners. Some of them are very
battered, but among them is a rather good-quality suitcase with integral induction-charged rollers and a keen sense of
loyalty: exactly the same model as his old one. He polls it and sees not just GPS, but a Galileo tracker, a gazetteer the size of
an old-time storage area network, and an iron determination to follow its owner as far as the gates of hell if necessary. Plus
the right distinctive scratch on the lower left side of the case. "How much for just this one?" he asks the bellwether on the
desk.
"Ninety euros," it says placidly.
Manfred sighs. "You can do better than that." In the time it takes them to settle on seventy-five, the Hang Sen Index is down
fourteen-point-one-six points, and what's left of NASDAQ climbs another two-point-one. "Deal." Manfred spits some virtual
cash at the brutal face of the cash register, and it unfetters the suitcase, unaware that Macx has paid a good bit more than
seventy-five euros for the privilege of collecting this piece of baggage. Manfred bends down and faces the camera in its handle.
"Manfred Macx," he says quietly. "Follow me." He feels the handle heat up as it imprints on his fingerprints, digital and
phenotypic. Then he turns and walks out of the slave market, his new luggage rolling at his heels.
***
A short train journey later, Manfred checks into a hotel in Milton Keynes. He watches the sun set from his bedroom
window, an occlusion of concrete cows blocking the horizon. The room is functional in an overly naturalistic kind of way,
rattan and force-grown hardwood and hemp rugs concealing the support systems and concrete walls behind. He sits in a
chair, gin and tonic at hand, absorbing the latest market news and grazing his multichannel feeds in parallel. His reputation is
up two percent for no obvious reason today, he notices: Odd, that. When he pokes at it he discovers that everybody's
reputation – everybody, that is, who has a publicly traded reputation – is up a bit. It's as if the distributed Internet
reputation servers are feeling bullish about integrity. Maybe there's a global honesty bubble forming.
Manfred frowns, then snaps his fingers. The suitcase rolls toward him. "Who do you belong to?" he asks.
"Manfred Macx," it replies, slightly bashfully.
"No, before me."
"I don't understand that question."
He sighs. "Open up."
Latches whir and retract: The hard-shell lid rises toward him, and he looks inside to confirm the contents.
The suitcase is full of noise.

Welcome to the early twenty-first century, human.
It's night in Milton Keynes, sunrise in Hong Kong. Moore's Law rolls inexorably on, dragging humanity
toward the uncertain future. The planets of the solar system have a combined mass of approximately 2 x
1 027 kilograms. Around the world, laboring women produce forty-five thousand babies a day, representing

1 023 MIPS of processing power. Also around the world, fab lines casually churn out thirty million
microprocessors a day, representing 1023 MIPS. In another ten months, most of the MIPS being added to the
solar system will be machine-hosted for the first time. About ten years after that, the solar system's installed
processing power will nudge the critical 1 MIPS per gram threshold – one million instructions per second
per gram of matter. After that, singularity – a vanishing point beyond which extrapolating progress becomes
meaningless. The time remaining before the intelligence spike is down to single-digit years ...

Aineko curls on the pillow beside Manfred's head, purring softly as his owner dreams uneasily. The night outside is dark:
Vehicles operate on autopilot, running lights dipped to let the Milky Way shine down upon the sleeping city. Their quiet,
fuel-cell-powered engines do not trouble Manfred's sleep. The robot cat keeps sleepless watch, alert for intruders, but there
are none, save the whispering ghosts of Manfred's metacortex, feeding his dreams with their state vectors.
The metacortex – a distributed cloud of software agents that surrounds him in netspace, borrowing CPU cycles from
convenient processors (such as his robot pet) – is as much a part of Manfred as the society of mind that occupies his skull;
his thoughts migrate into it, spawning new agents to research new experiences, and at night, they return to roost and share
their knowledge.
While Manfred sleeps, he dreams of an alchemical marriage. She waits for him at the altar in a strapless black gown, the
surgical instruments gleaming in her gloved hands. "This won't hurt a bit," she explains as she adjusts the straps. "I only want
your genome – the extended phenotype can wait until ... later." Blood-red lips, licked: a kiss of steel, then she presents the
income tax bill.
There's nothing accidental about this dream. As he experiences it, microelectrodes in his hypothalamus trigger sensitive
neurons. Revulsion and shame flood him at the sight of her face, the sense of his vulnerability. Manfred's metacortex, in
order to facilitate his divorce, is trying to decondition his strange love. It has been working on him for weeks, but still he
craves her whiplash touch, the humiliation of his wife's control, the sense of helpless rage at her unpayable taxes, demanded
with interest.
Aineko watches him from the pillow, purring continuously. Retractable claws knead the bedding, first one paw, then the
next. Aineko is full of ancient feline wisdom that Pamela installed back when mistress and master were exchanging data and
bodily fluids rather than legal documents. Aineko is more cat than robot, these days, thanks in part to her hobbyist's interest
in feline neuroanatomy. Aineko knows that Manfred is experiencing nameless neurasthenic agonies, but really doesn't give a
shit about that as long as the power supply is clean and there are no intruders.
Aineko curls up and joins Manfred in sleep, dreaming of laser-guided mice.
***
Manfred is jolted awake by the hotel room phone shrilling for attention.
"Hello?" he asks, fuzzily.
"Manfred Macx?" It's a human voice, with a gravelly east coast accent.
"Yeah?" Manfred struggles to sit up. His mouth feels like the inside of a tomb, and his eyes don't want to open.
"My name is Alan Glashwiecz, of Smoot, Sedgwick Associates. Am I correct in thinking that you are the Manfred Macx who is
a director of a company called, uh, agalmic dot holdings dot root dot one-eight-four dot ninety-seven dot A-for-able dot
B-for-baker dot five, incorporated?"
"Uh." Manfred blinks and rubs his eyes. "Hold on a moment." When the retinal patterns fade, he pulls on his glasses and
powers them up. "Just a second now." Browsers and menus ricochet through his sleep-laden eyes. "Can you repeat the
company name?"
"Sure." Glashwiecz repeats himself patiently. He sounds as tired as Manfred feels.
"Um." Manfred finds it, floating three tiers down an elaborate object hierarchy. It's flashing for attention. There's a priority
interrupt, an incoming lawsuit that hasn't propagated up the inheritance tree yet. He prods at the object with a property
browser. "I'm afraid I'm not a director of that company, Mr. Glashwiecz. I appear to be retained by it as a technical
contractor with non-executive power, reporting to the president, but frankly, this is the first time I've ever heard of the
company. However, I can tell you who's in charge if you want."
"Yes?" The attorney sounds almost interested. Manfred figures it out; the guy's in New Jersey, it must be about three in the
morning over there.
Malice – revenge for waking him up – sharpens Manfred's voice. "The president of agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.AB5 is
agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.201. The secretary is agalmic.holdings.root.184.D5, and the chair is
agalmic.holdings.root.184.E8.FF. All the shares are owned by those companies in equal measure, and I can tell you that their
regulations are written in Python. Have a nice day, now!" He thumps the bedside phone control and sits up, yawning, then
pushes the do-not-disturb button before it can interrupt again. After a moment he stands up and stretches, then heads to

the bathroom to brush his teeth, comb his hair, and figure out where the lawsuit originated and how a human being
managed to get far enough through his web of robot companies to bug him.
***
While he's having breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Manfred decides that he's going to do something unusual for a change:
He's going to make himself temporarily rich. This is a change because Manfred's normal profession is making other people
rich. Manfred doesn't believe in scarcity or zero-sum games or competition – his world is too fast and information-dense to
accommodate primate hierarchy games. However, his current situation calls for him to do something radical: something like
making himself a temporary billionaire so he can blow off his divorce settlement in an instant, like a wily accountancy octopus
escaping a predator by vanishing in a cloud of his own black ink.
Pam is chasing him partially for ideological reasons – she still hasn't given up on the idea of government as the dominant
superorganism of the age – but also because she loves him in her own peculiar way, and the last thing any self-respecting
dom can tolerate is rejection by her slave. Pam is a born-again postconservative, a member of the first generation to grow
up after the end of the American century. Driven by the need to fix the decaying federal system before it collapses under a
mound of Medicare bills, overseas adventurism, and decaying infrastructure, she's willing to use self-denial, entrapment,
predatory mercantilism, dirty tricks, and any other tool that boosts the bottom line. She doesn't approve of Manfred's jetting
around the world on free airline passes, making strangers rich, somehow never needing money. She can see his listing on the
reputation servers, hovering about thirty points above IBM: All the metrics of integrity, effectiveness and goodwill value him
above even that most fundamentalist of open-source computer companies. And she knows he craves her tough love, wants
to give himself to her completely. So why is he running away?
The reason he's running away is entirely more ordinary. Their unborn daughter, frozen in liquid nitrogen, is an unimplanted
96-hour-old blastula. Pam's bought into the whole Parents for Traditional Children parasite meme. PTC are germ-line
recombination refuseniks: They refuse to have their children screened for fixable errors. If there's one thing that Manfred
really can't cope with, it's the idea that nature knows best – even though that isn't the point she's making. One steaming row
too many, and he kicked back, off to traveling fast and footloose again, spinning off new ideas like a memetic dynamo and
living on the largesse of the new paradigm. File for divorce on grounds of irreconcilable ideological differences. No more
whiplash-and-leather sex.
***
Before he hits the TGV for Rome, Manfred takes time to visit a model airplane show. It's a good place to be picked up by a
CIA stringer – he's had a tip-off that someone will be there – and besides, flying models are hot hacker shit this decade. Add
microtechnology, cameras, and neural networks to balsa-wood flyers, and you've got the next generation of military stealth
flyer: It's a fertile talent-show scene, like the hacker cons of yore. This particular gig is happening in a decaying out-of-town
supermarket that rents out its shop floor for events like this. Its emptiness is a sign of the times, ubiquitous broadband and
expensive gas. (The robotized warehouse next door is, in contrast, frenetically busy, packing parcels for home delivery.
Whether they telecommute or herd in meatspace offices, people still need to eat.)
Today, the food hall is full of people. Eldritch ersatz insects buzz menacingly along the shining empty meat counters without
fear of electrocution. Big monitors unfurled above the deli display cabinets show a weird, jerky view of a three-dimensional
nightmare, painted all the synthetic colors of radar. The feminine-hygiene galley has been wheeled back to make room for a
gigantic plastic-shrouded tampon five meters long and sixty centimeters in diameter – a microsat launcher and conference
display, plonked there by the show's sponsors in a transparent attempt to talent-spot the up-and-coming engineering geeks.
Manfred's glasses zoom in and grab a particularly fetching Fokker triplane that buzzes at face height through the crowd: He
pipes the image stream up to one of his websites in real time. The Fokker pulls up in a tight Immelman turn beneath the
dust-shrouded pneumatic cash tubes that line the ceiling, then picks up the trail of an F-104G. Cold War Luftwaffe and
Great War Luftwaffe dart across the sky in an intricate game of tag. Manfred's so busy tracking the warbirds that he nearly
trips over the fat white tube's launcher-erector.
"Eh, Manfred! More care, s'il vous plait!"
He wipes the planes and glances round. "Do I know you?" he asks politely, even as he feels a shock of recognition.
"Amsterdam, three years ago." The woman in the double-breasted suit raises an eyebrow at him, and his social secretary
remembers her for him, whispers in his ear.
"Annette from Arianespace marketing?" She nods, and he focuses on her. Still dressing in the last-century retro mode that
confused him the first time they met, she looks like a Kennedy-era Secret Service man: cropped bleached crew cut like an
angry albino hedgehog, pale blue contact lenses, black tie, narrow lapels. Only her skin color hints at her Berber ancestry.
Her earrings are cameras, endlessly watching. Her raised eyebrow turns into a lopsided smile as she sees his reaction. "I
remember. That cafe in Amsterdam. What brings you here?"
"Why "– her wave takes in the entirety of the show – "this talent show, of course." An elegant shrug and a wave at the
orbit-capable tampon. "It's good talent. We're hiring this year. If we re-enter the launcher market, we must employ only the
best. Amateurs, not time-servers, engineers who can match the very best Singapore can offer."
For the first time, Manfred notices the discreet corporate logo on the flank of the booster. "You outsourced your
launch-vehicle fabrication?"

Annette pulls a face as she explains with forced casualness: "Space hotels were more profitable, this past decade. The
high-ups, they cannot be bothered with the rocketry, no? Things that go fast and explode, they are passé, they say. Diversify,
they say. Until –" She gives a very Gallic shrug. Manfred nods; her earrings are recording everything she says, for the
purposes of due diligence.
"I'm glad to see Europe re-entering the launcher business," he says seriously. "It's going to be very important when the
nanosystems conformational replication business gets going for real. A major strategic asset to any corporate entity in the
field, even a hotel chain." Especially now they've wound up NASA and the moon race is down to China and India, he thinks
sourly.
Her laugh sounds like glass bells chiming. "And yourself, mon cher? What brings you to the Confederaçion? You must have a
deal in mind."
"Well., it's Manfred's turn to shrug, "I was hoping to find a CIA agent, but there don't seem to be any here today."
"That is not surprising," Annette says resentfully. "The CIA thinks the space industry, she is dead. Fools!" She continues for a
minute, enumerating the many shortcomings of the Central Intelligence Agency with vigor and a distinctly Parisian rudeness.
"They are become almost as bad as AP and Reuters since they go public," she adds. "All these wire services! And they are, ah,
stingy. The CIA does not understand that good news must be paid for at market rates if freelance stringers are to survive.
They are to be laughed at. It is so easy to plant disinformation on them, almost as easy as the Office of Special Plans..." She
makes a banknote-riffling gesture between fingers and thumb. By way of punctuation, a remarkably maneuverable miniature
ornithopter swoops around her head, does a double-back flip, and dives off in the direction of the liquor display.
An Iranian woman wearing a backless leather minidress and a nearly transparent scarf barges up and demands to know how
much the microbooster costs to buy: She is dissatisfied with Annette's attempt to direct her to the manufacturer's website,
and Annette looks distinctly flustered by the time the woman's boyfriend – a dashing young air force pilot – shows up to
escort her away. "Tourists," she mutters, before noticing Manfred, who is staring off into space with fingers twitching.
"Manfred?"
"Uh – what?"
"I have been on this shop floor for six hours, and my feet, they kill me." She takes hold of his left arm and very deliberately
unhooks her earrings, turning them off. "If I say to you I can write for the CIA wire service, will you take me to a restaurant
and buy me dinner and tell me what it is you want to say?"

Welcome to the second decade of the twenty-first century; the second decade in human history when the
intelligence of the environment has shown signs of rising to match human demand.
The news from around the world is distinctly depressing this evening. In Maine, guerrillas affiliated with
Parents for Traditional Children announce they've planted logic bombs in antenatal-clinic gene scanners,
making them give random false positives when checking for hereditary disorders: The damage so far is six
illegal abortions and fourteen lawsuits.
The International Convention on Performing Rights is holding a third round of crisis talks in an attempt to
stave off the final collapse of the WIPO music licensing regime. On the one hand, hard-liners representing the
Copyright Control Association of America are pressing for restrictions on duplicating the altered emotional
states associated with specific media performances: As a demonstration that they mean business, two "software
engineers" in California have been kneecapped, tarred, feathered, and left for dead under placards accusing
them of reverse-engineering movie plot lines using avatars of dead and out-of-copyright stars.
On the opposite side of the fence, the Association of Free Artists are demanding the right of perform music
in public without a recording contract, and are denouncing the CCAA as being a tool of Mafiya apparachiks
who have bought it from the moribund music industry in an attempt to go legit. FBI Director Leonid
Kuibyshev responds by denying that the Mafiya is a significant presence in the United States. But the music
biz's position isn't strengthened by the near collapse of the legitimate American entertainment industry,
which has been accelerating ever since the nasty noughties.
A marginally intelligent voicemail virus masquerading as an IRS auditor has caused havoc throughout
America, garnishing an estimated eighty billion dollars in confiscatory tax withholdings into a numbered Swiss
bank account. A different virus is busy hijacking people's bank accounts, sending ten percent of their assets to
the previous victim, then mailing itself to everyone in the current mark's address book: a self- propelled
pyramid scheme in action. Oddly, nobody is complaining much. While the mess is being sorted out, business
IT departments have gone to standby, refusing to process any transaction that doesn't come in the shape of
ink on dead trees.
Tipsters are warning of an impending readjustment in the overinflated reputations market, following
revelations that some u-media gurus have been hyped past all realistic levels of credibility. The consequent
damage to the junk-bonds market in integrity is serious.
The EU council of independent heads of state has denied plans for another attempt at Eurofederalisme, at least

until the economy rises out of its current slump. Three extinct species have been resurrected in the past
month; unfortunately, endangered ones are now dying off at a rate of one a day. And a group of militant
anti-GM campaigners are being pursued by Interpol, after their announcement that they have spliced a
metabolic pathway for cyanogenic glycosides into maize seed corn destined for human-edible crops. There
have been no deaths yet, but having to test breakfast cereal for cyanide is really going to dent consumer
trust.
About the only people who're doing well right now are the uploaded lobsters – and the crusties aren't even
remotely human.

Manfred and Annette eat on the top deck of the buffet car, chatting as their TGV barrels through a tunnel under the
English Channel. Annette, it transpires, has been commuting daily from Paris; which was, in any case, Manfred's next
destination. From the show, he messaged Aineko to round up his baggage and meet him at St. Pancras Station, in a terminal
like the shell of a giant steel woodlouse. Annette left her space launcher in the supermarket overnight: an unfueled test
article, it is of no security significance.
The railway buffet car is run by a Nepalese fast-food franchise. "I sometimes wish for to stay on the train," Annette says as she
waits for her mismas bhat. "Past Paris! Think. Settle back in your couchette, to awaken in Moscow and change trains. All the
way to Vladivostok in two days."
"If they let you through the border," Manfred mutters. Russia is one of those places that still requires passports and asks if
you are now or ever have been an anti-anticommunist: It's still trapped by its bloody-handed history. (Rewind the video
stream to Stolypin's necktie party and start out fresh.) Besides, they have enemies: White Russian oligarchs, protection
racketeers in the intellectual property business. Psychotic relics of the last decade's experiment with Marxism-Objectivism.
"Are you really a CIA stringer?"
Annette grins, her lips disconcertingly red: "I file dispatches from time to time. Nothing that could get me fired."
Manfred nods. "My wife has access to their unfiltered stream."
"Your –" Annette pauses. "It was she who I, I met? In De Wildemann's?" She sees his expression. "Oh, my poor fool!" She
raises her glass to him. "It is, has, not gone well?"
Manfred sighs and raises a toast toward Annette. "You know your marriage is in a bad way when you send your spouse
messages via the CIA, and she communicates using the IRS."
"In only five years." Annette winces. "You will pardon me for saying this – she did not look like your type." There's a question
hidden behind that statement, and he notices again how good she is at overloading her statements with subtexts.
"I'm not sure what my type is," he says, half-truthfully. He can't elude the sense that something not of either of their doing
went wrong between him and Pamela, a subtle intrusion that levered them apart by stealth. Maybe it was me, he thinks.
Sometimes he isn't certain he's still human; too many threads of his consciousness seem to live outside his head, reporting
back whenever they find something interesting. Sometimes he feels like a puppet, and that frightens him because it's one of
the early-warning signs of schizophrenia. And it's too early for anyone out there to be trying to hack exocortices ... isn't it?
Right now, the external threads of his consciousness are telling him that they like Annette, when she's being herself instead of
a cog in the meatspace ensemble of Arianespace management. But the part of him that's still human isn't sure just how far to
trust himself. "I want to be me. What do you want to be?"
She shrugs, as a waiter slides a plate in front of her. "I'm just a, a Parisian babe, no? An ingénue raised in the lilac age of le
Confederaçion Europé, the self-deconstructed ruins of the gilded European Union."
"Yeah, right." A plate appears in front of Manfred. "And I'm a good old microboomer from the MassPike corridor." He peels
back a corner of the omelet topping and inspects the food underneath it. "Born in the sunset years of the American
century." He pokes at one of the unidentifiable meaty lumps in the fried rice with his fork, and it pokes right back. There's a
limit to how much his agents can tell him about her – European privacy laws are draconian by American standards – but he
knows the essentials. Two parents who are still together, father a petty politician in some town council down in the vicinity of
Toulouse. Went to the right école. The obligatory year spent bumming around the Confederaçion at government expense,
learning how other people live – a new kind of empire building, in place of the 20th century's conscription and jackboot
wanderjahr. No weblog or personal site that his agents can find. She joined Arianespace right out of the Polytechnique and
has been management track ever since: Korou, Manhattan Island, Paris. "You've never been married, I take it."
She chuckles. "Time is too short! I am still young." She picks up a forkful of food, and adds quietly. "Besides, the government
would insist on paying."
"Ah." Manfred tucks into his bowl thoughtfully. With the birth rate declining across Europe, the EC bureaucracy is worried;
the old EU started subsidizing babies, a new generation of carers, a decade ago, and it still hasn't dented the problem. All it's
done is alienate the brightest women of childbearing age. Soon they'll have to look to the east for a solution, importing a
new generation of citizens – unless the long-promised aging hacks prove workable, or cheap AI comes along.
"Do you have a hotel?" Annette asks suddenly.

"In Paris?" Manfred is startled: "Not yet."
"You must come home with me, then." She looks at him quizzically.
"I'm not sure I – " He catches her expression. "What is it?"
"Oh, nothing. My friend Henri, he says I take in strays too easily. But you are not a stray. I think you can look after yourself.
Besides, it is the Friday today. Come with me, and I will file your press release for the Company to read. Tell me, do you
dance? You look as if you need a wild week ending, to help forget your troubles!"
***
Annette drives a steamroller seduction through Manfred's plans for the weekend. He intended to find a hotel, file a press
release, then spend some time researching the corporate funding structure of Parents for Traditional Children and the
dimensionality of confidence variation on the reputation exchanges – then head for Rome. Instead, Annette drags him back
to her apartment, a large studio flat tucked away behind an alley in the Marais. She sits him at the breakfast bar while she
tidies away his luggage, then makes him close his eyes and swallow two dubious-tasting capsules. Next, she pours them each a
tall glass of freezing-cold Aqvavit that tastes exactly like Polish rye bread. When they finish it, she just about rips his clothes
off. Manfred is startled to discover that he has a crowbar-stiff erection; since the last blazing row with Pamela, he'd vaguely
assumed he was no longer interested in sex. Instead, they end up naked on the sofa, surrounded by discarded clothing –
Annette is very conservative, preferring the naked penetrative fuck of the last century to the more sophisticated fetishes of
the present day.
Afterward, he's even more surprised to discover that he's still tumescent. "The capsules?" he asks.
She sprawls a well-muscled but thin thigh across him, then reaches down to grab his penis. Squeezes it. "Yes," she admits.
"You need much special help to unwind, I think." Another squeeze. "Crystal meth and a traditional phosphodiesterase
inhibitor." He grabs one of her small breasts, feeling very brutish and primitive. Naked. He's not sure Pamela ever let him see
her fully naked: She thought skin was more sexy when it was covered. Annette squeezes him again, and he stiffens. "More!"
By the time they finish, he's aching, and she shows him how to use the bidet. Everything is crystal clear, and her touch is
electrifying. While she showers, he sits on the toilet seat lid and rants about Turing-completeness as an attribute of company
law, about cellular automata and the blind knapsack problem, about his work on solving the Communist Central Planning
problem using a network of interlocking unmanned companies. About the impending market adjustment in integrity, the
sinister resurrection of the recording music industry, and the still-pressing need to dismantle Mars.
When she steps out of the shower, he tells her that he loves her. She kisses him and slides his glasses and earpieces off his
head so that he's really naked, sits on his lap, and fucks his brains out again, and whispers in his ear that she loves him and
wants to be his manager. Then she leads him into her bedroom and tells him exactly what she wants him to wear, and she
puts on her own clothes, and she gives him a mirror with some white powder on it to sniff. When she's got him dolled up
they go out for a night of really serious clubbing, Annette in a tuxedo and Manfred in a blond wig, red silk off-the-shoulder
gown, and high heels. Sometime in the early hours, exhausted and resting his head on her shoulder during the last tango in
a BDSM club in the Rue Ste-Anne, he realizes that it really is possible to be in lust with someone other than Pamela.
***
Aineko wakes Manfred by repeatedly head-butting him above the left eye. He groans, and as he tries to open his eyes, he
finds that his mouth tastes like a dead trout, his skin feels greasy with make-up, and his head is pounding. There's a banging
noise somewhere. Aineko meows urgently. He sits up, feeling unaccustomed silk underwear rubbing against incredibly sore
skin – he's fully dressed, just sprawled out on the sofa. Snores emanate from the bedroom; the banging is coming from the
front door. Someone wants to come in. Shit. He rubs his head, stands up, and nearly falls flat on his face: He hasn't even
taken those ridiculous high heels off. How much did I drink last night? he wonders. His glasses are on the breakfast bar; he pulls
them on and is besieged by an urgent flurry of ideas demanding attention. He straightens his wig, picks up his skirts, and
trips across to the door with a sinking feeling. Luckily his publicly traded reputation is strictly technical.
He unlocks the door. "Who is it?" he asks in English. By way of reply somebody shoves the door in, hard. Manfred falls back
against the wall, winded. His glasses stop working, sidelook displays filling with multicolored static.
Two men charge in, identically dressed in jeans and leather jackets. They're wearing gloves and occlusive face masks, and one
of them points a small and very menacing ID card at Manfred. A self-propelled gun hovers in the doorway, watching
everything. "Where is he?"
"Who?" gasps Manfred, breathless and terrified.
"Macx." The other intruder steps into the living room quickly, pans around, ducks through the bathroom door. Aineko flops
as limp as a dishrag in front of the sofa. The intruder checks out the bedroom: There's a brief scream, cut off short.
"I don't know – who?" Manfred is choking with fear.
The other intruder ducks out of the bedroom, waves a hand dismissively.
"We are sorry to have bothered you," the man with the card says stiffly. He replaced it in his jacket pocket. "If you should

see Manfred Macx, tell him that the Copyright Control Association of America advises him to cease and desist from his
attempt to assist music thieves and other degenerate mongrel second-hander enemies of Objectivism. Reputations only of use
to those alive to own them. Goodbye."
The two copyright gangsters disappear through the door, leaving Manfred to shake his head dizzily while his glasses reboot. It
takes him a moment to register the scream from the bedroom. "Fuck – Annette!"
She appears in the open doorway, holding a sheet around her waist, looking angry and confused. "Annette!" he calls. She
looks around, sees him, and begins to laugh shakily. "Annette!" He crosses over to her. "You're okay," he says. "You're okay."
"You too." She hugs him, and she's shaking. Then she holds him at arm's length. "My, what a pretty picture!"
"They wanted me," he says, and his teeth are chattering. "Why?"
She looks up at him seriously. "You must bathe. Then have coffee. We are not at home, oui?"
"Ah, oui." He looks down. Aineko is sitting up, looking dazed. "Shower. Then that dispatch for CIA news."
"The dispatch?" She looks puzzled. "I filed that last night. When I was in the shower. The microphone, he is waterproof."
***
By the time Arianespace's security contractors show up, Manfred has stripped off Annette's evening gown and showered; he's
sitting in the living room wearing a bathrobe, drinking a half-liter mug of espresso and swearing under his breath.
While he was dancing the night away in Annette's arms, the global reputation market has gone nonlinear: People are putting
their trust in the Christian Coalition and the Eurocommunist Alliance – always a sign that the times are bad – while perfectly
sound trading enterprises have gone into free fall, as if a major bribery scandal has broken out.
Manfred trades ideas for kudos via the Free Intellect Foundation, bastard child of George Soros and Richard Stallman. His
reputation is cemented by donations to the public good that don't backfire. So he's offended and startled to discover that
he's dropped twenty points in the past two hours – and frightened to see that this is by no means unusual. He was
expecting a ten-point drop mediated via an options trade – payment for the use of the anonymous luggage remixer that
routed his old suitcase to Mombasa and in return sent this new one to him via the left-luggage office in Luton – but this is
more serious. The entire reputation market seems to have been hit by the confidence flu.
Annette bustles around busily, pointing out angles and timings to the forensics team her head office sent in answer to her
call for back-up. She seems more angry and shaken than worried by the intrusion. It's probably an occupational hazard for
any upwardly mobile executive in the old, grasping network of greed that Manfred's agalmic future aims to supplant. The
forensics dude and dudette, a pair of cute, tanned Lebanese youngsters, point the yellow snout of their mass spectroscope
into various corners and agree that there's something not unlike gun oil in the air. But, so sorry, the intruders wore masks
to trap the skin particles and left behind a spray of dust vacuumed from the seat of a city bus, so there's no way of getting a
genotype match. Presently they agree to log it as a suspected corporate intrusion (origin: unclassified; severity: worrying) and
increase the logging level on her kitchen telemetry. And remember to wear your earrings at all times, please. They leave, and
Annette locks the door, leans against it, and curses for a whole long minute.
"They gave me a message from the copyright control agency," Manfred says unevenly when she winds down. "Russian
gangsters from New York bought the recording cartels a few years ago, you know? After the rights stitch-up fell apart, and
the artists all went on-line while they focused on copy prevention technologies, the Mafiya were the only people who would
buy the old business model. These guys add a whole new meaning to copy protection: This was just a polite cease and desist
notice by their standards. They run the record shops, and they try to block any music distribution channel they don't own.
Not very successfully, though – most gangsters are living in the past, more conservative than any normal businessman can
afford to be. What was it that you put on the wire?"
Annette closes her eyes. "I don't remember. No." She holds up a hand. "Open mike. I streamed you into a file and cut, cut
out the bits about me." She opens her eyes and shakes her head. "What was I on?"
"You don't know either?"
He stands up, and she walks over and throws her arms around him. "I was on you," she murmurs.
"Bullshit." He pulls away, then sees how this upsets her. Something is blinking for attention in his glasses; he's been off-line for
the best part of six hours and is getting a panicky butterfly stomach at the idea of not being in touch with everything that's
happened in the last twenty kiloseconds. "I need to know more. Something in that report rattled the wrong cages. Or
someone ratted on the suitcase exchange – I meant the dispatch to be a heads-up for whoever needs a working state
planning system, not an invitation to shoot me!"
"Well, then." She lets go of him. "Do your work." Coolly: "I'll be around."
He realizes that he's hurt her, but he doesn't see any way of explaining that he didn't mean to – at least, not without digging
himself in deeper. He finishes his croissant and plunges into one of those unavoidable fits of deep interaction, fingers
twitching on invisible keypads and eyeballs jiggling as his glasses funnel deep media straight into his skull through the highest
bandwidth channel currently available.

One of his e-mail accounts is halfway to the moon with automatic messages, companies with names like
agalmic.holdings.root.8E.F0 screaming for the attention of their transitive director. Each of these companies – and there are
currently more than sixteen thousand of them, although the herd is growing day by day – has three directors and is the
director of three other companies. Each of them executes a script in a functional language Manfred invented; the directors
tell the company what to do, and the instructions include orders to pass instructions on to their children. In effect, they are
a flock of cellular automata, like the cells in Conway's Game of Life, only far more complex and powerful.
Manfred's companies form a programmable grid. Some of them are armed with capital in the form of patents Manfred filed,
then delegated rather than passing on to one of the Free Foundations. Some of them are effectively nontrading, but occupy
directorial roles. Their corporate functions (such as filing of accounts and voting in new directors) are all handled centrally
through his company-operating framework, and their trading is carried out via several of the more popular B2B enabler
dot-coms. Internally, the companies do other, more obscure load-balancing computations, processing resource-allocation
problems like a classic state central planning system. None of which explains why fully half of them have been hit by lawsuits
in the past twenty-two hours.
The lawsuits are ... random. That's the only pattern Manfred can detect. Some of them allege patent infringements; these he
might take seriously, except that about a third of the targets are director companies that don't actually do anything visible
to the public. A few lawsuits allege mismanagement, but then there's a whole bizarre raft of spurious nonsense: suits for
wrongful dismissal or age discrimination – against companies with no employees – complaints about reckless trading, and one
action alleging that the defendant (in conspiracy with the prime minister of Japan, the government of Canada, and the Emir
of Kuwait) is using orbital mind-control lasers to make the plaintiff's pet chihuahua bark at all hours of day and night.
Manfred groans and does a quick calculation. At the current rate, lawsuits are hitting his corporate grid at a rate of one
every sixteen seconds – up from none in the preceding six months. In another day, this is going to saturate him. If it keeps
up for a week, it'll saturate every court in the United States. Someone has found a means to do for lawsuits what he's doing
for companies – and they've chosen him as their target.
To say that Manfred is unamused is an understatement. If he wasn't already preoccupied with Annette's emotional state and
edgy from the intrusion, he'd be livid – but he's still human enough that he responds to human stimuli first. So he
determines to do something about it, but he's still flashing on the floating gun, her cross-dressing cool.
Transgression, sex, and networks; these are all on his mind when Glashwiecz phones again.
"Hello?" Manfred answers distractedly; he's busy pondering the lawsuit bot that's attacking his systems.
"Macx! The elusive Mr. Macx!" Glashwiecz sounds positively overjoyed to have tracked down his target.
Manfred winces. "Who is this?" he asks.
"I called you yesterday," says the lawyer; "You should have listened." He chortles horribly. "Now I have you!"
Manfred holds the phone away from his face, like something poisonous. "I'm recording this," he warns. "Who the hell are you
and what do you want?"
"Your wife has retained my partnership's services to pursue her interests in your divorce case. When I called you yesterday it
was to point out without prejudice that your options are running out. I have an order, signed in court three days ago, to
have all your assets frozen. These ridiculous shell companies notwithstanding, she's going to take you for exactly what you
owe her. After tax, of course. She's very insistent on that point."
Manfred glances round, puts his phone on hold for a moment: "Where's my suitcase?" he asks Aineko. The cat sidles away,
ignoring him. "Shit." He can't see the new luggage anywhere. Quite possibly it's on its way to Morocco, complete with its
priceless cargo of high-density noise. He returns his attention to the phone. Glashwiecz is droning on about equitable
settlements, cumulative IRS tax demands – that seem to have materialized out of fantasy with Pam's imprimatur on them –
and the need to make a clean breast of things in court and confess to his sins. "Where's the fucking suitcase?" He takes the
phone off hold. "Shut the fuck up, please, I'm trying to think."
"I'm not going to shut up! You're on the court docket already, Macx. You can't evade your responsibilities forever. You've
got a wife and a helpless daughter to care for –"
"A daughter?" That cuts right through Manfred's preoccupation with the suitcase.
"Didn't you know?" Glashwiecz sounds pleasantly surprised. "She was decanted last Thursday. Perfectly healthy, I'm told. I
thought you knew; you have viewing rights via the clinic webcam. Anyway, I'll just leave you with this thought – the sooner
you come to a settlement, the sooner I can unfreeze your companies. Good-bye."
The suitcase rolls into view, peeping coyly out from behind Annette's dressing table. Manfred breathes a sigh of relief and
beckons to it; at the moment, it's easier to deal with his Plan B than dawn raids by objectivist gangsters, Annette's sulk, his
wife's incessant legal spamming, and the news that he is a father against his will. "C'mon over here, you stray baggage. Let's see
what I got for my reputation derivatives ..."

Anticlimax.
Annette's communiqué is anodyne; a giggling confession off camera (shower-curtain rain in the background) that the famous
Manfred Macx is in Paris for a weekend of clubbing, drugging, and general hell-raising. Oh, and he's promised to invent three
new paradigm shifts before breakfast every day, starting with a way to bring about the creation of Really Existing
Communism by building a state central planning apparatus that interfaces perfectly with external market systems and
somehow manages to algorithmically outperform the Monte Carlo free-for-all of market economics, solving the calculation
problem. Just because he can, because hacking economics is fun, and he wants to hear the screams from the Chicago School.
Try as he may, Manfred can't see anything in the press release that is at all unusual. It's just the sort of thing he does, and
getting it on the net was why he was looking for a CIA stringer in the first place.
He tries to explain this to her in the bath as he soaps her back. "I don't understand what they're on about," he complains.
"There's nothing that tipped them off – except that I was in Paris, and you filed the news. You did nothing wrong."
"Mais oui." She turns round, slippery as an eel, and slides backward into the water. "I try to tell you this, but you are not
listening."
"I am now." Water droplets cling to the outside of his glasses, plastering his view of the room with laser speckle highlights.
"I'm sorry, Annette, I brought this mess with me. I can take it out of your life."
"No!" She rises up in front of him and leans forward, face serious. "I said yesterday. I want to be your manager. Take me in."
"I don't need a manager; my whole thing is about being fast and out of control!"
"You think you do not need a manager, but your companies do," she observes. "You have lawsuits, how many? You cannot
the time to oversee them spare. The Soviets, they abolish capitalists, but even they need managers. Please, let me manage for
you!"
Annette is so intense about the idea that she becomes visibly aroused. He leans toward her, cups a hand around one taut
nipple. "The company matrix isn't sold yet," he admits.
"It is not?" She looks delighted. "Excellent! To who can this be sold, to Moscow? To SLORC? To –"
"I was thinking of the Italian Communist Party," he says. "It's a pilot project. I was working on selling it – I need the money for
my divorce, and to close the deal on the luggage – but it's not that simple. Someone has to run the damn thing – someone
with a keen understanding of how to interface a central planning system with a capitalist economy. A system administrator
with experience of working for a multinational corporation would be perfect, ideally with an interest in finding new ways and
means of interfacing the centrally planned enterprise to the outside world." He looks at her with suddenly dawning surmise.
"Um, are you interested?"

Rome is hotter than downtown Columbia, South Carolina, over Thanksgiving weekend; it stinks of methane-burning Skodas
with a low undertone of cooked dog shit. The cars are brightly colored subcompact missiles, hurtling in and out of alleyways
like angry wasps: Hot-wiring their drive-by-wire seems to be the national sport, although Fiat's embedded systems people
have always written notoriously wobbly software.
Manfred emerges from the Stazione Termini into dusty sunlight, blinking like an owl. His glasses keep up a rolling monologue
about who lived where in the days of the late Republic. They're stuck on a tourist channel and won't come unglued from
that much history without a struggle. Manfred doesn't feel like a struggle right now. He feels like he's been sucked dry over
the weekend: a light, hollow husk that might blow away in a stiff breeze. He hasn't had a patentable idea all day. This is not a
good state to be in on a Monday morning when he's due to meet the former Minister for Economic Affairs, in order to give
him a gift that will probably get the minister a shot at higher office and get Pam's lawyer off his back. But somehow he can't
bring himself to worry too much: Annette has been good for him.
The ex-minister's private persona isn't what Manfred was expecting. All Manfred has seen so far is a polished public avatar in
a traditionally cut suit, addressing the Chamber of Deputies in cyberspace; which is why, when he rings the doorbell set in
the whitewashed doorframe of Gianni's front door, he isn't expecting a piece of Tom of Finland beefcake, complete with
breechclout and peaked leather cap, to answer.
"Hello, I am here to see the minister," Manfred says carefully. Aineko, perched on his left shoulder, attempts to translate: It
trills something that sounds extremely urgent. Everything sounds urgent in Italian.
"It's okay, I'm from Iowa," says the guy in the doorway. He tucks a thumb under one leather strap and grins over his
moustache: "What's it about?" Over his shoulder: "Gianni! Visitor!"
"It's about the economy," Manfred says carefully. "I'm here to make it obsolete."
The beefcake backs away from the door cautiously – then the minister appears behind him. "Ah, signore Macx! It's okay,
Johnny, I have been expecting him." Gianni extends a rapid welcome, like a hyperactive gnome buried in a white toweling
bathrobe: "Please come in, my friend! I'm sure you must be tired from your journey. A refreshment for the guest if you
please, Johnny. Would you prefer coffee or something stronger?"

Five minutes later, Manfred is buried up to his ears in a sofa covered in buttery white cowhide, a cup of virulently strong
espresso balanced precariously on his knee, while Gianni Vittoria himself holds forth on the problems of implementing a
postindustrial ecosystem on top of a bureaucratic system with its roots in the bullheadedly modernist era of the 1920s.
Gianni is a visionary of the left, a strange attractor within the chaotic phase-space of Italian politics. A former professor of
Marxist economics, his ideas are informed by a painfully honest humanism, and everyone – even his enemies – agrees that he
is one of the greatest theoreticians of the post-EU era. But his intellectual integrity prevents him from rising to the very top,
and his fellow travelers are much ruder about him than his ideological enemies, accusing him of the ultimate political crime
— valuing truth over power.
Manfred had met Gianni a couple of years earlier via a hosted politics chat room; at the beginning of last week, he sent him a
paper detailing his embeddable planned economy and a proposal for using it to turbocharge the endless Italian attempt to
re-engineer its government systems. This is the thin end of the wedge: If Manfred is right, it could catalyse a whole new wave
of communist expansion, driven by humanitarian ideals and demonstrably superior performance, rather than wishful
thinking and ideology.
"It is impossible, I fear. This is Italy, my friend. Everybody has to have their say. Not everybody even understands what it is we
are talking about, but that won't stop them talking about it. Since 1945, our government requires consensus – a reaction to
what came before. Do you know, we have five different routes to putting forward a new law, two of them added as
emergency measures to break the gridlock? And none of them work on their own unless you can get everybody to agree.
Your plan is daring and radical, but if it works, we must understand why we work – and that digs right to the root of being
human, and not everybody will agree."
At this point Manfred realizes that he's lost. "I don't understand," he says, genuinely puzzled. "What has the human condition
got to do with economics?"
The minister sighs abruptly. "You are very unusual. You earn no money, do you? But you are rich, because grateful people
who have benefited from your work give you everything you need. You are like a medieval troubadour who has found favor
with the aristocracy. Your labor is not alienated – it is given freely, and your means of production is with you always, inside
your head." Manfred blinks; the jargon is weirdly technical-sounding but orthogonal to his experience, offering him a
disquieting glimpse into the world of the terminally future-shocked. He is surprised to find that not understanding itches.
Gianni taps his balding temple with a knuckle like a walnut. "Most people spend little time inside their heads. They don't
understand how you live. They're like medieval peasants looking in puzzlement at the troubadour. This system you invent,
for running a planned economy, is delightful and elegant: Lenin's heirs would have been awestruck. But it is not a system for
the new century. It is not human."
Manfred scratches his head. "It seems to me that there's nothing human about the economics of scarcity," he says. "Anyway,
humans will be obsolete as economic units within a couple more decades. All I want to do is make everybody rich beyond
their wildest dreams before that happens." A pause for a sip of coffee, and to think, one honest statement deserves another:
"And to pay off a divorce settlement."
"Ye-es? Well, let me show you my library, my friend," he says, standing up. "This way."
Gianni ambles out of the white living room with its carnivorous leather sofas, and up a cast-iron spiral staircase that nails
some kind of upper level to the underside of the roof. "Human beings aren't rational," he calls over his shoulder. "That was
the big mistake of the Chicago School economists, neoliberals to a man, and of my predecessors, too. If human behavior was
logical, there would be no gambling, hmm? The house always wins, after all." The staircase debouches into another airy
whitewashed room, where one wall is occupied by a wooden bench supporting a number of ancient, promiscuously cabled
servers and a very new, eye-wateringly expensive solid volume renderer. Opposite the bench is a wall occupied from floor to
ceiling by bookcases: Manfred looks at the ancient, low-density medium and sneezes, momentarily bemused by the sight of
data density measured in kilograms per megabyte rather than vice versa.
"What's it fabbing?" Manfred asks, pointing at the renderer, which is whining to itself and slowly sintering together something
that resembles a carriage clockmaker's fever dream of a spring-powered hard disk drive.
"Oh, one of Johnny's toys – a micromechanical digital phonograph player," Gianni says dismissively. "He used to design
Babbage engines for the Pentagon – stealth computers. (No van Eck radiation, you know.) Look." He carefully pulls a
fabric-bound document out of the obsolescent data wall and shows the spine to Manfred: "On the Theory of Games, by John
von Neumann. Signed first edition."
Aineko meeps and dumps a slew of confusing purple finite state automata into Manfred's left eye. The hardback is dusty and
dry beneath his fingertips as he remembers to turn the pages gently. "This copy belonged to the personal library of Oleg
Kordiovsky. A lucky man is Oleg: He bought it in 1952, while on a visit to New York, and the MVD let him to keep it."
"He must be –" Manfred pauses. More data, historical time lines. "Part of GosPlan?"
"Correct." Gianni smiles thinly. "Two years before the central committee denounced computers as bourgeois deviationist
pseudoscience intended to dehumanize the proletarian. They recognized the power of robots even then. A shame they did
not anticipate the compiler or the Net."
"I don't understand the significance. Nobody back then could expect that the main obstacle to doing away with market
capitalism would be overcome within half a century, surely?"

"Indeed not. But it's true: Since the 1980s, it has been possible – in principle – to resolve resource allocation problems
algorithmically, by computer, instead of needing a market. Markets are wasteful: They allow competition, much of which is
thrown on the scrap heap. So why do they persist?"
Manfred shrugs. "You tell me. Conservativism?"
Gianni closes the book and puts it back on the shelf. "Markets afford their participants the illusion of free will, my friend. You
will find that human beings do not like being forced into doing something, even if it is in their best interests. Of necessity, a
command economy must be coercive – it does, after all, command."
"But my system doesn't! It mediates where supplies go, not who has to produce what –"
Gianni is shaking his head. "Backward chaining or forward chaining, it is still an expert system, my friend. Your companies
need no human beings, and this is a good thing, but they must not direct the activities of human beings, either. If they do,
you have just enslaved people to an abstract machine, as dictators have throughout history."
Manfred's eyes scan along the bookshelf. "But the market itself is an abstract machine! A lousy one, too. I'm mostly free of it –
but how long is it going to continue oppressing people?"
"Maybe not as long as you fear." Gianni sits down next to the renderer, which is currently extruding the inference mill of
the analytical engine. "The marginal value of money decreases, after all: The more you have, the less it means to you. We are
on the edge of a period of prolonged economic growth, with annual averages in excess of twenty percent, if the Council of
Europe's predictor metrics are anything to go by. The last of the flaccid industrial economy has withered away, and this era's
muscle of economic growth, what used to be the high-technology sector, is now everything. We can afford a little wastage,
my friend, if that is the price of keeping people happy until the marginal value of money withers away completely."
Realization dawns. "You want to abolish scarcity, not just money!"
"Indeed." Gianni grins. "There's more to that than mere economic performance; you have to consider abundance as a factor.
Don't plan the economy; take things out of the economy. Do you pay for the air you breathe? Should uploaded minds –
who will be the backbone of our economy, by and by – have to pay for processor cycles? No and no. Now, do you want to
know how you can pay for your divorce settlement? And can I interest you, and your interestingly accredited new manager,
in a little project of mine?"
***
The shutters are thrown back, the curtains tied out of the way, and Annette's huge living room windows are drawn open in
the morning breeze.
Manfred sits on a leather-topped piano stool, his suitcase open at his feet. He's running a link from the case to Annette's
stereo, an antique stand-alone unit with a satellite Internet uplink. Someone has chipped it, crudely revoking its copy
protection algorithm: The back of its case bears scars from the soldering iron. Annette is curled up on the huge sofa,
wrapped in a kaftan and a pair of high-bandwidth goggles, thrashing out an internal Arianespace scheduling problem with
some colleagues in Iran and Guyana.
His suitcase is full of noise, but what's coming out of the stereo is ragtime. Subtract entropy from a data stream –
coincidentally uncompressing it – and what's left is information. With a capacity of about a trillion terabytes, the suitcase's
holographic storage reservoir has enough capacity to hold every music, film, and video production of the twentieth century
with room to spare. This is all stuff that is effectively out of copyright control, work-for-hire owned by bankrupt companies,
released before the CCAA could make their media clampdown stick. Manfred is streaming the music through Annette's
stereo – but keeping the noise it was convoluted with. High-grade entropy is valuable, too ...
Presently, Manfred sighs and pushes his glasses up his forehead, killing the displays. He's thought his way around every
permutation of what's going on, and it looks like Gianni was right: There's nothing left to do but wait for everyone to show
up.
For a moment, he feels old and desolate, as slow as an unassisted human mind. Agencies have been swapping in and out of
his head for the past day, ever since he got back from Rome. He's developed a butterfly attention span, irritable and unable
to focus on anything while the information streams fight it out for control of his cortex, arguing about a solution to his
predicament. Annette is putting up with his mood swings surprisingly calmly. He's not sure why, but he glances her way
fondly. Her obsessions run surprisingly deep, and she's quite clearly using him for her own purposes. So why does he feel
more comfortable around her than he did with Pam?
She stretches and pushes her goggles up. "Oui?"
"I was just thinking." He smiles. "Three days and you haven't told me what I should be doing with myself, yet."
She pulls a face. "Why would I do that?"
"Oh, no reason. I'm just not over – " He shrugs uncomfortably. There it is, an inexplicable absence in his life, but not one he
feels he urgently needs to fill yet. Is this what a relationship between equals feels like? He's not sure: Starting with the
occlusive cocooning of his upbringing and continuing through all his adult relationships, he's been effectively – voluntarily –

dominated by his partners. Maybe the antisubmissive conditioning is working, after all. But if so, why the creative malaise?
Why isn't he coming up with original new ideas this week? Could it be that his peculiar brand of creativity is an outlet, that
he needs the pressure of being lovingly enslaved to make him burst out into a great flowering of imaginative brilliance? Or
could it be that he really is missing Pam?
Annette stands up and walks over, slowly. He looks at her and feels lust and affection, and isn't sure whether or not this is
love. "When are they due?" she asks, leaning over him.
"Any –" The doorbell chimes.
"Ah. I will get that." She stalks away, opens the door.
"You!"
Manfred's head snaps round as if he's on a leash. Her leash: But he wasn't expecting her to come in person.
"Yes, me," Annette says easily. "Come in. Be my guest."
Pam enters the apartment living room with flashing eyes, her tame lawyer in tow. "Well, look what the robot kitty dragged
in," she drawls, fixing Manfred with an expression that owes more to anger than to humor. It's not like her, this blunt
hostility, and he wonders where it came from.
Manfred rises. For a moment he's transfixed by the sight of his dominatrix wife, and his – mistress? conspirator? lover? – side
by side. The contrast is marked: Annette's expression of ironic amusement a foil for Pamela's angry sincerity. Somewhere
behind them stands a balding middle-aged man in a suit, carrying a folio: just the kind of diligent serf Pam might have turned
him into, given time. Manfred musters up a smile. "Can I offer you some coffee?" he asks. "The party of the third part seems
to be late."
"Coffee would be great, mine's dark, no sugar," twitters the lawyer. He puts his briefcase down on a side table and fiddles
with his wearable until a light begins to blink from his spectacle frames: "I'm recording this, I'm sure you understand."
Annette sniffs and heads for the kitchen, which is charmingly manual but not very efficient; Pam is pretending she doesn't
exist. "Well, well, well." She shakes her head. "I'd expected better of you than a French tart's boudoir, Manny. And before
the ink's dry on the divorce – these days that'll cost you, didn't you think of that?"
"I'm surprised you're not in the hospital," he says, changing the subject. "Is postnatal recovery outsourced these days?"
"The employers." She slips her coat off her shoulders and hangs it behind the broad wooden door. "They subsidize
everything when you reach my grade." Pamela is wearing a very short, very expensive dress, the kind of weapon in the war
between the sexes that ought to come with an end-user certificate: But to his surprise it has no effect on him. He realizes
that he's completely unable to evaluate her gender, almost as if she's become a member of another species. "As you'd be
aware if you'd been paying attention."
"I always pay attention, Pam. It's the only currency I carry."
"Very droll, ha-ha," interrupts Glashwiecz. "You do realize that you're paying me while I stand here listening to this
fascinating byplay?"
Manfred stares at him. "You know I don't have any money."
"Ah," Glashwiecz smiles, "but you must be mistaken. Certainly the judge will agree with me that you must be mistaken – all a
lack of paper documentation means is that you've covered your trail. There's the small matter of the several thousand
corporations you own, indirectly. Somewhere at the bottom of that pile there has got to be something, hasn't there?"
A hissing, burbling noise like a sackful of large lizards being drowned in mud emanates from the kitchen, suggesting that
Annette's percolator is nearly ready. Manfred's left hand twitches, playing chords on an air keyboard. Without being at all
obvious, he's releasing a bulletin about his current activities that should soon have an effect on the reputation marketplace.
"Your attack was rather elegant," he comments, sitting down on the sofa as Pam disappears into the kitchen.
Glashwiecz nods. "The idea was one of my interns'," he says. "I don't understand this distributed denial of service stuff, but
Lisa grew up on it. Something about it being a legal travesty, but workable all the same."
"Uh-huh." Manfred's opinion of the lawyer drops a notch. He notices Pam reappearing from the kitchen, her expression icy.
A moment later Annette surfaces carrying a jug and some cups, beaming innocently. Something's going on, but at that
moment, one of his agents nudges him urgently in the left ear, his suitcase keens mournfully and beams a sense of utter
despair at him, and the doorbell rings again.
"So what's the scam?" Glashwiecz sits down uncomfortably close to Manfred and murmurs out of one side of his mouth.
"Where's the money?"
Manfred looks at him irritably. "There is no money," he says. "The idea is to make money obsolete. Hasn't she explained
that?" His eyes wander, taking in the lawyer's Patek Philippe watch, his Java-enabled signet ring.

"C'mon. Don't give me that line. Look, all it takes is a couple of million, and you can buy your way free for all I care. All I'm
here for is to see that your wife and daughter don't get left penniless and starving. You know and I know that you've got
bags of it stuffed away – just look at your reputation! You didn't get that by standing at the roadside with a begging bowl,
did you?"
Manfred snorts. "You're talking about an elite IRS auditor here. She isn't penniless; she gets a commission on every poor
bastard she takes to the cleaners, and she was born with a trust fund. Me, I –" The stereo bleeps. Manfred pulls his glasses on.
Whispering ghosts of dead artists hum through his earlobes, urgently demanding their freedom. Someone knocks at the door
again, and he glances around to see Annette walking toward it.
"You're making it hard on yourself," Glashwiecz warns.
"Expecting company?" Pam asks, one brittle eyebrow raised in Manfred's direction.
"Not exactly –"
Annette opens the door and a couple of guards in full SWAT gear march in. They're clutching gadgets that look like crosses
between digital sewing machines and grenade launchers, and their helmets are studded with so many sensors that they
resemble 1950s space probes. "That's them," Annette says clearly.
"Mais Oui." The door closes itself and the guards stand to either side. Annette stalks toward Pam.
"You think to walk in here, to my pied-a-terre, and take from Manfred?" she sniffs.
"You're making a big mistake, lady," Pam says, her voice steady and cold enough to liquefy helium.
A burst of static from one of the troopers. "No," Annette says distantly. "No mistake."
She points at Glashwiecz. "Are you aware of the takeover?"
"Takeover?" The lawyer looks puzzled, but not alarmed by the presence of the guards.
"As of three hours ago," Manfred says quietly, "I sold a controlling interest in agalmic.holdings.root.1.1.1 to Athene
Accelerants BV, a venture capital outfit from Maastricht. One dot one dot one is the root node of the central planning tree.
Athene aren't your usual VC, they're accelerants – they take explosive business plans and detonate them." Glashwiecz is
looking pale – whether with anger or fear of a lost commission is impossible to tell. "Actually, Athene Accelerants is owned
by a shell company owned by the Italian Communist Party's pension trust. The point is, you're in the presence of one dot
one dot one's chief operations officer."
Pam looks annoyed. "Puerile attempts to dodge responsibility –"
Annette clears her throat. "Exactly who do you think you are trying to sue?" she asks Glashwiecz sweetly. "Here we have laws
about unfair restraint of trade. Also about foreign political interference, specifically in the financial affairs of an Italian party of
government."
"You wouldn't –"
"I would." Manfred brushes his hands on his knees and stands up. "Done, yet?" he asks the suitcase.
Muffled beeps, then a gravelly synthesized voice speaks. "Uploads completed."
"Ah, good." He grins at Annette. "Time for our next guests?"
On cue, the doorbell rings again. The guards sidle to either side of the door. Annette snaps her fingers, and it opens to
admit a pair of smartly dressed thugs. It's beginning to get crowded in the living room.
"Which one of you is Macx?" snaps the older one of the two thugs, staring at Glashwiecz for no obvious reason. He hefts an
aluminum briefcase. "Got a writ to serve."
"You'd be the CCAA?" asks Manfred.
"You bet. If you're Macx, I have a restraining order –"
Manfred raises a hand. "It's not me you want," he says. "It's this lady." He points at Pam, whose mouth opens in silent protest.
"Y'see, the intellectual property you're chasing wants to be free. It's so free that it's now administered by a complex set of
corporate instruments lodged in the Netherlands, and the prime shareholder as of approximately four minutes ago is my
soon-to-be-ex-wife Pamela, here." He winks at Glashwiecz. "Except she doesn't control anything."
"Just what do you think you're playing at, Manfred?" Pamela snarls, unable to contain herself any longer. The guards shuffle:
The larger, junior CCAA enforcer tugs at his boss's jacket nervously.
"Well." Manfred picks up his coffee and takes a sip. Grimaces. "Pam wanted a divorce settlement, didn't she? The most
valuable assets I own are the rights to a whole bunch of recategorized work-for-hire that slipped through the CCAA's fingers

a few years back. Part of the twentieth century's cultural heritage that got locked away by the music industry in the last
decade – Janis Joplin, the Doors, that sort of thing. Artists who weren't around to defend themselves anymore. When the
music cartels went bust, the rights went for a walk. I took them over originally with the idea of setting the music free. Giving
it back to the public domain, as it were."
Annette nods at the guards, one of whom nods back and starts muttering and buzzing into a throat mike. Manfred
continues. "I was working on a solution to the central planning paradox – how to interface a centrally planned enclave to a
market economy. My good friend Gianni Vittoria suggested that such a shell game could have alternative uses. So I've not
freed the music. Instead, I signed the rights over to various actors and threads running inside the agalmic holdings network –
currently one million, forty-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-five companies. They swap rights rapidly – the rights to
any given song are resident in a given company for, oh, all of fifty milliseconds at a time. Now understand, I don't own these
companies. I don't even have a financial interest in them anymore. I've deeded my share of the profits to Pam, here. I'm
getting out of the biz, Gianni's suggested something rather more challenging for me to do instead."
He takes another mouthful of coffee. The recording Mafiya goon glares at him. Pam glares at him. Annette stands against one
wall, looking amused. "Perhaps you'd like to sort it out between you?" he asks. Aside, to Glashwiecz: "I trust you'll drop your
denial of service attack before I set the Italian parliament on you? By the way, you'll find the book value of the intellectual
property assets I deeded to Pamela – by the value these gentlemen place on them – is somewhere in excess of a billion
dollars. As that's rather more than ninety-nine-point-nine percent of my assets, you'll probably want to look elsewhere for
your fees."
Glashwiecz stands up carefully. The lead goon stares at Pamela. "Is this true?" he demands. "This little squirt give you IP assets
of Sony Bertelsmann Microsoft Music? We have claim! You come to us for distribution or you get in deep trouble."
The second goon rumbles agreement: "Remember, dose MP3s, dey bad for you health!"
Annette claps her hands. "If you would to leave my apartment, please?" The door, attentive as ever, swings open: "You are no
longer welcome here!"
"This means you," Manfred advises Pam helpfully.
"You bastard," she spits at him.
Manfred forces a smile, bemused by his inability to respond to her the way she wants. Something's wrong, missing, between
them. "I thought you wanted my assets. Are the encumbrances too much for you?"
"You know what I mean! You and that two-bit Euro-whore! I'll nail you for child neglect!"
His smile freezes. "Try it, and I'll sue you for breach of patent rights. My genome, you understand."
Pam is taken aback by this. "You patented your own genome? What happened to the brave new communist, sharing
information freely?"
Manfred stops smiling. "Divorce happened. And the Italian Communist Party happened."
She turns on her heel and stalks out of the apartment bravely, tame attorney in tow behind her, muttering about class
action lawsuits and violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The CCAA lawyer's tame gorilla makes a grab for
Glashwiecz's shoulder, and the guards move in, hustling the whole movable feast out into the stairwell. The door slams shut
on a chaos of impending recursive lawsuits, and Manfred breathes a huge wheeze of relief.
Annette walks over to him and leans her chin on the top of his head. "Think it will work?" she asks.
"Well, the CCAA will sue the hell out of the company network for a while if they try to distribute by any channel that isn't
controlled by the Mafiya. Pam gets rights to all the music, her settlement, but she can't sell it without going through the
mob. And I got to serve notice on that legal shark: If he tries to take me on he's got to be politically bullet-proof. Hmm.
Maybe I ought not to plan on going back to the USA this side of the singularity."
"Profits," Annette sighs, "I do not easily understand this way of yours. Or this apocalyptic obsession with singularity."
"Remember the old aphorism, if you love something, set it free? I freed the music."
"But you didn't! You signed rights over –"
"But first I uploaded the entire stash to several cryptographically anonymized public network filesystems over the past few
hours, so there'll be rampant piracy. And the robot companies are all set to automagically grant any and every copyright
request they receive, royalty-free, until the goons figure out how to hack them. But that's not the point. The point is
abundance. The Mafiya can't stop it being distributed. Pam is welcome to her cut if she can figure an angle – but I bet she
can't. She still believes in classical economics, the allocation of resources under conditions of scarcity. Information doesn't
work that way. What matters is that people will be able to hear the music – instead of a Soviet central planning system, I've
turned the network into a firewall to protect freed intellectual property."
"Oh, Manfred, you hopeless idealist." She strokes his shoulder. "Whatever for?"

"It's not just the music. When we develop a working AI or upload minds we'll need a way of defending it against legal threats.
That's what Gianni pointed out to me ..."
He's still explaining to her how he's laying the foundations for the transhuman explosion due early in the next decade when
she picks him up in both arms, carries him to her bedroom, and commits outrageous acts of tender intimacy with him. But
that's okay. He's still human, this decade.

Chapter 3: Tourist
Spring-Heeled Jack runs blind, blue fumes crackling from his heels. His right hand, outstretched for balance, clutches a mark's
stolen memories. The victim is sitting on the hard stones of the pavement behind him. Maybe he's wondering what's
happened; maybe he looks after the fleeing youth. But the tourist crowds block the view effectively, and in any case, he has
no hope of catching the mugger. Hit-and-run amnesia is what the polis call it, but to Spring-Heeled Jack it's just more loot to
buy fuel for his Russian army-surplus motorized combat boots.

The victim sits on the cobblestones clutching his aching temples. What happened? he wonders. The universe is a brightly
colored blur of fast-moving shapes augmented by deafening noises. His ear-mounted cameras are rebooting repeatedly: They
panic every eight hundred milliseconds, whenever they realize that they're alone on his personal area network without the
comforting support of a hub to tell them where to send his incoming sensory feed. Two of his mobile phones are bickering
moronically, disputing ownership of his grid bandwidth, and his memory ... is missing.
A tall blond clutching an electric chainsaw sheathed in pink bubble wrap leans over him curiously: "you all right?" she asks.
"I –" He shakes his head, which hurts. "Who am I?" His medical monitor is alarmed because his blood pressure has fallen: His
pulse is racing, his serum cortisol titer is up, and a host of other biometrics suggest that he's going into shock.
"I think you need an ambulance," the woman announces. She mutters at her lapel, "Phone, call an ambulance. " She waves a
finger vaguely at him as if to reify a geolink, then wanders off, chain-saw clutched under one arm. Typical southern émigré
behavior in the Athens of the North, too embarrassed to get involved. The man shakes his head again, eyes closed, as a flock
of girls on powered blades skid around him in elaborate loops. A siren begins to warble, over the bridge to the north.
Who am I? he wonders. "I'm Manfred," he says with a sense of stunned wonder. He looks up at the bronze statue of a man on
a horse that looms above the crowds on this busy street corner. Someone has plastered a Hello Cthulhu! holo on the
plaque that names its rider: Languid fluffy pink tentacles wave at him in an attack of kawaii. "I'm Manfred – Manfred. My
memory. What's happened to my memory?" Elderly Malaysian tourists point at him from the open top deck of a passing bus.
He burns with a sense of horrified urgency. I was going somewhere, he recalls. What was I doing? It was amazingly important,
he thinks, but he can't remember what exactly it was. He was going to see someone about – it's on the tip of his tongue –

Welcome to the eve of the third decade: a time of chaos characterized by an all-out depression in the space
industries.
Most of the thinking power on the planet is now manufactured rather than born; there are ten
microprocessors for every human being, and the number is doubling every fourteen months. Population
growth in the developing world has stalled, the birth rate dropping below replacement level. In the wired
nations, more forward-looking politicians are looking for ways to enfranchise their nascent AI base.
Space exploration is still stalled on the cusp of the second recession of the century. The Malaysian
government has announced the goal of placing an imam on Mars within ten years, but nobody else cares
enough to try.
The Space Settlers Society is still trying to interest Disney Corp. in the media rights to their latest L5 colony
plan, unaware that there's already a colony out there and it isn't human: First-generation uploads,
Californian spiny lobsters in wobbly symbiosis with elderly expert systems, thrive aboard an asteroid mining
project established by the Franklin Trust. Meanwhile, Chinese space agency cutbacks are threatening the
continued existence of Moonbase Mao. Nobody, it seems, has figured out how to turn a profit out beyond
geosynchronous orbit.
Two years ago, JPL, the ESA, and the uploaded lobster colony on comet Khrunichev-7 picked up an
apparently artificial signal from outside the solar system; most people don't know, and of those who do, even
fewer care. After all, if humans can't even make it to Mars, who cares what's going on a hundred trillion
kilometers farther out?

Portrait of a wasted youth:
Jack is seventeen years and eleven months old. He has never met his father; he was unplanned, and Dad managed to kill
himself in a building-site accident before the Child Support could garnish his income for the upbringing. His mother raised
him in a two-bedroom housing association flat in Hawick. She worked in a call center when he was young, but business dried
up: Humans aren't needed on the end of a phone anymore. Now she works in a drop-in business shop, stacking shelves for
virtual fly-by-nights that come and go like tourists in the Festival season – but humans aren't in demand for shelf stacking
either, these days.
His mother sent Jack to a local religious school, where he was regularly excluded and effectively ran wild from the age of
twelve. By thirteen, he was wearing a parole cuff for shoplifting; by fourteen, he'd broken his collarbone in a car crash while
joyriding and the dour Presbyterian sheriff sent him to the Wee Frees, who completed the destruction of his educational
prospects with high principles and an illicit tawse.
Today, he's a graduate of the hard school of avoiding public surveillance cameras, with distinctions in steganographic alibi
construction. Mostly this entails high-density crime – if you're going to mug someone, do so where there are so many
bystanders that they can't pin the blame on you. But the polis expert systems are on his tail. If he keeps it up at this rate, in
another four months they'll have a positive statistical correlation that will convince even a jury of his peers that he's guilty as
fuck – and then he'll go down to Saughton for four years.
But Jack doesn't understand the meaning of a Gaussian distribution or the significance of a chi-square test, and the future
still looks bright to him as he pulls on the chunky spectacles he ripped off the tourist gawking at the statue on North Bridge.
And after a moment, when they begin whispering into his ears in stereo and showing him pictures of the tourist's vision, it
looks even brighter.
"Gotta make a deal, gotta close a deal," whisper the glasses. "Meet the borg, strike a chord." Weird graphs in lurid colors are
filling up his peripheral vision, like the hallucinations of a drugged marketroid.
"Who the fuck are ye?" asks Jack, intrigued by the bright lights and icons.
"I am your Cartesian theatre and you are our focus," murmur the glasses. "Dow Jones down fifteen points, Federated
Confidence up three, incoming briefing on causal decoupling of social control of skirt hem lengths, shaving pattern of beards,
and emergence of multidrug antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacilli: Accept?"
"Ah can take it," Jack mumbles, as a torrent of images crashes down on his eyeballs and jackhammers its way in through his
ears like the superego of a disembodied giant. Which is actually what he's stolen: The glasses and waist pouch he grabbed
from the tourist are stuffed with enough hardware to run the entire Internet, circa the turn of the millennium. They've got
bandwidth coming out the wazoo, distributed engines running a bazillion inscrutable search tasks, and a whole slew of
high-level agents that collectively form a large chunk of the society of mind that is their owner's personality. Their owner is a
posthuman genius loci of the net, an agalmic entrepreneur turned policy wonk, specializing in the politics of AI emancipation.
When he was in the biz he was the kind of guy who catalysed value wherever he went, leaving money trees growing in his
footprints. Now he's the kind of political backroom hitter who builds coalitions where nobody else could see common
ground. And Jack has stolen his memories. There are microcams built into the frame of the glasses, pickups in the earpieces;
everything is spooled into the holographic cache in the belt pack, before being distributed for remote storage. At four
months per terabyte, memory storage is cheap. What makes this bunch so unusual is that their owner – Manfred – has
cross-indexed them with his agents. Mind uploading may not be a practical technology yet, but Manfred has made an end
run on it already.
In a very real sense, the glasses are Manfred, regardless of the identity of the soft machine with its eyeballs behind the lenses.
And it is a very puzzled Manfred who picks himself up and, with a curious vacancy in his head – except for a hesitant
request for information about accessories for Russian army boots – dusts himself off and heads for his meeting on the other
side of town.
***
Meanwhile, in another meeting, Manfred's absence is already being noticed. "Something, something is wrong," says Annette.
She raises her mirrorshades and rubs her left eye, visibly worried. "Why is he not answering his chat? He knows we are due
to hold this call with him. Don't you think it is odd?"
Gianni nods and leans back, regarding her from behind his desk. He prods at the highly polished rosewood desktop. The
wood grain slips, sliding into a strangely different conformation, generating random dot stereoisograms – messages for his
eyes only. "He was visiting Scotland for me," he says after a moment. "I do not know his exact whereabouts – the privacy
safeguards – but if you, as his designated next of kin, travel in person, I am sure you will find it easier. He was going to talk
to the Franklin Collective, face-to-face, one to many ..."
The office translator is good, but it can't provide real-time lip-synch morphing between French and Italian. Annette has to
make an effort to listen to his words because the shape of his mouth is all wrong, like a badly dubbed video. Her expensive,
recent implants aren't connected up to her Broca's area yet, so she can't simply sideload a deep grammar module for Italian.
Their communications are the best that money can buy, their VR environment painstakingly sculpted, but it still doesn't
break down the language barrier completely. Besides, there are distractions: the way the desk switches from black ash to
rosewood halfway across its expanse, the strange air currents that are all wrong for a room this size. "Then what could be
up with him? His voicemail is trying to cover for him. It is good, but it does not lie convincingly."

Gianni looks worried. "Manfred is prone to fits of do his own thing with telling nobody in advance. But I don't like this. He
should have to told one of us first." Ever since that first meeting in Rome, when Gianni offered him a job, Manfred has been
a core member of Gianni's team, the fixer who goes out and meets people and solves their problems. Losing him at this
point could be more than embarrassing. Besides, he's a friend.
"I do not like this either." She stands up. "If he doesn't call back soon –"
"You'll go and fetch him."
"Oui." A smile flashes across her face, rapidly replaced by worry lines. "What can have happened?"
"Anything. Nothing." Gianni shrugs. "But we cannot do without him." He casts her a warning glance. "Or you. Don't let the
borg get you. Either of you."
"Not to worry, I will just bring him back, whatever has happened." She stands up, surprising a vacuum cleaner that skulks
behind her desk. "Au revoir!"
"Ciao."
As she vacates her office, the minister flickers off behind her, leaving the far wall the dull gray of a cold display panel. Gianni
is in Rome, she's in Paris, Markus is in Düsseldorf, and Eva's in Wroclaw. There are others, trapped in digital cells scattered
halfway across an elderly continent, but as long as they don't try to shake hands, they're free to shout across the office at
each other. Their confidences and dirty jokes tunnel through multiple layers of anonymized communication.
Gianni is trying to make his break out of regional politics and into European national affairs: Their job – his election team –
is to get him a seat on the Confederacy Commission, as Representative for Intelligence Oversight, and push the boundaries of
post-humanistic action outward, into deep space and deeper time. Which makes the loss of a key team player, the house
futurologist and fixer, profoundly interesting to certain people: The walls have ears, and not all the brains they feed into are
human.
Annette is more worried than she's letting on to Gianni. It's unlike Manfred to be out of contact for long and even odder
for his receptionist to stonewall her, given that her apartment is the nearest thing to a home he's had for the past couple of
years. But something smells fishy. He sneaked out last night, saying it would be an overnight trip, and now he's not
answering. Could it be his ex-wife? she wonders, despite Gianni's hints about a special mission. But there's been no word from
Pamela other than the sarcastic cards she dispatches every year without fail, timed to arrive on the birthday of the daughter
Manfred has never met. The music Mafiya? A letter bomb from the Copyright Control Association of America? But no, his
medical monitor would have been screaming its head off if anything like that had happened.
Annette has organized things so that he's safe from the intellectual property thieves. She's lent him the support he needs,
and he's helped her find her own path. She gets a warm sense of happiness whenever she considers how much they've
achieved together. But that's exactly why she's worried now. The watchdog hasn't barked ...
Annette summons a taxi to Charles de Gaulle. By the time she arrives, she's already used her parliamentary carte to bump
an executive-class seat on the next A320 to Turnhouse, Edinburgh's airport, and scheduled accommodation and transport
for her arrival. The plane is climbing out over la Manche before the significance of Gianni's last comment hits her: Might he
think the Franklin Collective could be dangerous to Manfred?
***
The hospital emergency suite has a waiting room with green plastic bucket seats and subtractive volume renderings by
preteens stuck to the walls like surreal Lego sculptures. It's deeply silent, the available bandwidth all sequestrated for medical
monitors – there are children crying, periodic sirens wailing as ambulances draw up, and people chattering all around him,
but to Manfred, it's like being at the bottom of a deep blue pool of quiet. He feels stoned, except this particular drug brings
no euphoria or sense of well-being. Corridor-corner vendors hawk kebab-spitted pigeons next to the chained and rusted
voluntary service booth; video cameras watch the blue bivvy bags of the chronic cases lined up next to the nursing station.
Alone in his own head, Manfred is frightened and confused.
"I can't check you in 'less you sign the confidentiality agreement," says the triage nurse, pushing an antique tablet at Manfred's
face. Service in the NHS is still free, but steps have been taken to reduce the incidence of scandals: "Sign the nondisclosure
clause here and here, or the house officer won't see you."
Manfred stares blearily up at the nurse's nose, which is red and slightly inflamed from a nosocomial infection. His phones are
bickering again, and he can't remember why; they don't normally behave like this, something must be missing, but thinking
about it is hard. "Why am I here?" he asks for the third time.
"Sign it." A pen is thrust into his hand. He focuses on the page, jerks upright as deeply canalized reflexes kick in.
"This is theft of human rights! It says here that the party of the second part is enjoined from disclosing information relating
to the operations management triage procedures and processes of the said health-giving institution, that's you, to any third
party – that's the public media – on pain of forfeiture of health benefits pursuant to section two of the Health Service
Reform Act. I can't sign this! You could repossess my left kidney if I post on the Net about how long I've been in hospital!"

"So don't sign, then." The Hijra nurse shrugs, hitches up his sari, and walks away. "Enjoy your wait!"
Manfred pulls out his backup phone and stares at its display. "Something's wrong here." The keypad beeps as he laboriously
inputs opcodes. This gets him into an arcane and ancient X.25 PAD, and he has a vague, disturbing memory that hints
about where he can go from here – mostly into the long-since-decommissioned bowels of NHSNet – but the memories
spring a page fault and die somewhere between fingertips and the moment when understanding dawns. It's a frustrating
feeling: His brain is like an ancient car engine with damp spark plugs, turning over and over without catching fire.
The kebab vendor next to Manfred's seating rail chucks a stock cube on his grill; it begins to smoke, aromatic and blue and
herbal – cannabinoids to induce tranquillity and appetite. Manfred sniffs twice, then staggers to his feet and heads off in
search of the toilet, his head spinning. He's mumbling at his wrist watch: "Hello, Guatemala? Get me posology please. Click down
my meme tree, I'm confused. Oh shit. Who was I? What happened? Why is everything blurry? I can't find my glasses ..."
A gaggle of day-trippers are leaving the leprosy ward, men and women dressed in anachronistic garb: men in dark suits,
women in long dresses. All of them wear electric blue disposable gloves and face masks. There's a hum and crackle of
encrypted bandwidth emanating from them, and Manfred instinctively turns to follow. They leave the A&E unit through the
wheelchair exit, two ladies escorted by three gentlemen, with a deranged distressed refugee from the twenty-first century
shuffling dizzily after. They're all young, Manfred realizes vaguely. Where's my cat? Aineko might be able to make sense of this, if
Aineko was interested.
"I rather fancy we should retire to the club house," says one young beau. "Oh yes! please!" his short blond companion chirps,
clapping her hands together, then irritably stripping off the anachronistic plastic gloves to reveal wired-lace positional-sensor
mitts underneath. "This trip has obviously been unproductive. If our contact is here, I see no easy way of locating of him
without breach of medical confidence or a hefty gratuity."
"The poor things," murmurs the other woman, glancing back at the leprosarium. "Such a humiliating way to die."
"Their own fault; If they hadn't participated in antibiotic abuse they wouldn't be in the isolation ward," harrumphs a
twentysomething with mutton-chops and the manner of a precocious paterfamilias. He raps his walking stick on the
pavement for punctuation, and they pause for a flock of cyclists and a rickshaw before they cross the road onto the
Meadows. "Degenerate medication compliance, degenerate immune systems."
Manfred pauses to survey the grass, brain spinning as he ponders the fractal dimensionality of leaves. Then he lurches after
them, nearly getting himself run down by a flywheel-powered tourist bus. Club. His feet hit the pavement, cross it, thud down
onto three billion years of vegetative evolution. Something about those people. He feels a weird yearning, a tropism for
information. It's almost all that's left of him – his voracious will to know. The tall, dark-haired woman hitches up her long
skirts to keep them out of the mud. he sees a flash of iridescent petticoats that ripple like oil on water, worn over
old-fashioned combat boots. Not Victorian, then: something else. I came here to see – the name is on the tip of his tongue.
Almost. He feels that it has something to do with these people.
The squad cross The Meadows by way of a tree-lined path, and come to a nineteenth-century frontage with wide steps and a
polished brass doorbell. They enter, and the man with the mutton-chops pauses on the threshold and turns to face Manfred.
"You've followed us this far," he says. "Do you want to come in? You might find what you're looking for."
Manfred follows with knocking knees, desperately afraid of whatever he's forgotten.
***
Meanwhile, Annette is busy interrogating Manfred's cat.
"When did you last see your father?"
Aineko turns its head away from her and concentrates on washing the inside of its left leg. Its fur is lifelike and thick,
pleasingly patterned except for a manufacturer's URL emblazoned on its flanks; but the mouth produces no saliva, the throat
opens on no stomach or lungs. "Go away," it says: "I'm busy."
"When did you last see Manfred?" she repeats intently. "I don't have time for this. The polis don't know. The medical services
don't know. He's off net and not responding. So what can you tell me?"
It took her precisely eighteen minutes to locate his hotel once she hit the airport arrivals area and checked the hotel
booking front end in the terminal: She knows his preferences. It took her slightly longer to convince the concierge to let her
into his room. But Aineko is proving more recalcitrant than she'd expected.
"AI Neko mod two alpha requires maintenance downtime on a regular basis," the cat says pompously: "You knew that when
you bought me this body. What were you expecting, five-nines uptime from a lump of meat? Go away, I'm thinking." The
tongue rasps out, then pauses while microprobes in its underside replace the hairs that fell out earlier in the day.
Annette sighs. Manfred's been upgrading this robot cat for years, and his ex-wife Pamela used to mess with its neural
configuration too: This is its third body, and it's getting more realistically uncooperative with every hardware upgrade.
Sooner or later it's going to demand a litter tray and start throwing up on the carpet. "Command override," she says.
"Dump event log to my Cartesian theatre, minus eight hours to present."

The cat shudders and looks round at her. "Human bitch!" it hisses. Then it freezes in place as the air fills with a bright and
silent tsunami of data. Both Annette and Aineko are wired for extremely high-bandwidth spread-spectrum optical
networking; an observer would see the cat's eyes and a ring on her left hand glow blue-white at each other. After a few
seconds, Annette nods to herself and wiggles her fingers in the air, navigating a time sequence only she can see. Aineko hisses
resentfully at her, then stands and stalks away, tail held high.
"Curiouser and curiouser," Annette hums to herself. She intertwines her fingers, pressing obscure pressure points on knuckle
and wrist, then sighs and rubs her eyes. "He left here under his own power, looking normal," she calls to the cat. "Who did
he say he was going to see?" The cat sits in a beam of sunlight falling in through the high glass window, pointedly showing her
its back. "Merde. If you're not going to help him –"
"Try the Grassmarket," sulks the cat. "He said something about meeting the Franklin Collective near there. Much good they'll
do him ..."
***
A man wearing secondhand Chinese combat fatigues and a horribly expensive pair of glasses bounces up a flight of damp
stone steps beneath a keystone that announces the building to be a Salvation Army hostel. He bangs on the door, his voice
almost drowned out by the pair of Cold War Re-enactment Society MiGs that are buzzing the castle up the road: "Open up,
ye cunts! Ye've got a deal comin'!"
A peephole set in the door at eye level slides to one side, and a pair of beady, black-eyed video cameras peer out at him.
"Who are you and what do you want?" the speaker crackles. They don't belong to the Salvation Army; Christianity has been
deeply unfashionable in Scotland for some decades, and the church that currently occupies the building has certainly moved
with the times in an effort to stay relevant.
"I'm Macx," he says: "You've heard from my systems. I'm here to offer you a deal you can't refuse." At least that's what his
glasses tell him to say: What comes out of his mouth sounds a bit more like, Am Max: Yiv hurdfrae ma system. Am here tae gie
ye a deal ye cannae refuse. The glasses haven't had long enough to work on his accent. Meanwhile, he's so full of himself that he
snaps his fingers and does a little dance of impatience on the top step.
"Aye, well, hold on a minute." The person on the other side of the speakerphone has the kind of cut-glass Morningside
accent that manages to sound more English than the King while remaining vernacular Scots. The door opens, and Macx finds
himself confronted by a tall, slightly cadaverous man wearing a tweed suit that has seen better days and a clerical collar cut
from a translucent circuit board. His face is almost concealed behind a pair of recording angel goggles. "Who did ye say you
were?"
"I'm Macx! Manfred Macx! I'm here with an opportunity you wouldn't believe. I've got the answer to your church's financial
situation. I'm going to make you rich!" The glasses prompt, and Macx speaks.
The man in the doorway tilts his head slightly, goggles scanning Macx from head to foot. Bursts of blue combustion products
spurt from Macx's heels as he bounces up and down enthusiastically. "Are ye sure ye've got the right address?" he asks
worriedly.
"Aye, Ah am that."
The resident backs into the hostel: "Well then, come in, sit yeself down and tell me all about it."
Macx bounces into the room with his brain wide open to a blizzard of pie charts and growth curves, documents spawning
in the bizarre phase-space of his corporate management software. "I've got a deal you're not going to believe," he reads,
gliding past notice boards upon which Church circulars are staked out to die like exotic butterflies, stepping over rolled-up
carpets and a stack of laptops left over from a jumble sale, past the devotional radio telescope that does double duty as Mrs.
Muirhouse's back-garden bird bath. "You've been here five years and your posted accounts show you aren't making much
money – barely keeping the rent up. But you're a shareholder in Scottish Nuclear Electric, right? Most of the church funds
are in the form of a trust left to the church by one of your congregants when she went to join the omega point, right?"
"Er." The minister looks at him oddly. "I cannae comment on the church eschatological investment trust. Why d'ye think
that?"
They fetch up, somehow, in the minister's office. A huge, framed rendering hangs over the back of his threadbare office chair:
the collapsing cosmos of the End Times, galactic clusters rotten with the Dyson spheres of the eschaton falling toward the big
crunch. Saint Tipler the Astrophysicist beams down from above with avuncular approval, a ring of quasars forming a halo
around his head. Posters proclaim the new Gospel: COSMOLOGY IS BETTER THAN GUESSWORK, and LIVE FOREVER
WITHIN MY LIGHT CONE. "Can I get ye anything? Cup of tea? Fuel cell charge point?" asks the minister.
"Crystal meth?" asks Macx, hopefully. His face falls as the minister shakes his head apologetically. "Aw, dinnae worry, Ah wis
only joshing." He leans forward: "Ah know a' aboot yer plutonium futures speculation," he hisses. A finger taps his stolen
spectacles in an ominous gesture: "These dinnae just record, they think. An' Ah ken where the money's gone."
"What have ye got?" the minister asks coldly, any indication of good humor flown. "I'm going to have to edit down these
memories, ye bastard. I thought I'd forgotten all about that. Bits of me aren't going to merge with the godhead at the end of
time now, thanks to you."

"Keep yer shirt on. Whit's the point o' savin' it a' up if ye nae got a life worth living? Ye reckon the big yin's nae gonnae
unnerstan' a knees up?"
"What do ye want?"
"Aye, well," Macx leans back, aggrieved. Ah've got –" He pauses. An expression of extreme confusion flits over his head.
"Ah've got lobsters," he finally announces. "Genetically engineered uploaded lobsters tae run yer uranium reprocessing plant."
As he grows more confused, the glasses' control over his accent slips: "Ah wiz gonnae help yiz oot ba showin ye how ter get
yer dosh back whir it belong ..." A strategic pause: "so ye could make the council tax due date. See, they're neutron-resistant,
the lobsters. No, that cannae be right. Ah wiz gonnae sell ye somethin' ye cud use fer" – his face slumps into a frown of
disgust – "free?"
Approximately thirty seconds later, as he is picking himself up off the front steps of the First Reformed Church of Tipler,
Astrophysicist, the man who would be Macx finds himself wondering if maybe this high finance shit isn't as easy as it's cracked
up to be. Some of the agents in his glasses are wondering if elocution lessons are the answer; others aren't so optimistic.
***
Getting back to the history lesson, the prospects for the decade look mostly medical.
A few thousand elderly baby boomers are converging on Tehran for Woodstock Four. Europe is desperately
trying to import eastern European nurses and home-care assistants; in Japan, whole agricultural villages lie
vacant and decaying, ghost communities sucked dry as cities slurp people in like residential black holes.
A rumor is spreading throughout gated old-age communities in the American Midwest, leaving havoc and
riots in its wake: Senescence is caused by a slow virus coded into the mammalian genome that evolution
hasn't weeded out, and rich billionaires are sitting on the rights to a vaccine. As usual, Charles Darwin gets
more than his fair share of the blame. (Less spectacular but more realistic treatments for old age – telomere
reconstruction and hexose-denatured protein reduction – are available in private clinics for those who are
willing to surrender their pensions.) Progress is expected to speed up shortly, as the fundamental patents in
genomic engineering begin to expire; the Free Chromosome Foundation has already published a manifesto
calling for the creation of an intellectual-property-free genome with improved replacements for all commonly
defective exons.
Experiments in digitizing and running neural wetware under emulation are well established; some radical
libertarians claim that, as the technology matures, death – with its draconian curtailment of property and
voting rights – will become the biggest civil rights issue of all.
For a small extra fee, most veterinary insurance policies now cover cloning of pets in the event of their
accidental and distressing death. Human cloning, for reasons nobody is very clear on anymore, is still illegal
in most developed nations – but very few judiciaries push for mandatory abortion of identical twins.
Some commodities are expensive: the price of crude oil has broken eighty Euros a barrel and is edging
inexorably up. Other commodities are cheap: computers, for example. Hobbyists print off weird new
processor architectures on their home inkjets; middle-aged folks wipe their backsides with diagnostic paper
that can tell how their cholesterol levels are tending.
The latest casualties of the march of technological progress are: the high-street clothes shop, the flushing
water closet, the Main Battle Tank, and the first generation of quantum computers. New with the decade are
cheap enhanced immune systems, brain implants that hook right into the Chomsky organ and talk to their
owners through their own speech centers, and widespread public paranoia about limbic spam.
Nanotechnology has shattered into a dozen disjoint disciplines, and skeptics are predicting that it will all
peter out before long. Philosophers have ceded qualia to engineers, and the current difficult problem in AI is
getting software to experience embarrassment.
Fusion power is still, of course, fifty years away.

The Victorians are morphing into goths before Manfred's culture-shocked eyes.
"You looked lost," explains Monica, leaning over him curiously. "What's with your eyes?"
"I can't see too well," Manfred tries to explain. Everything is a blur, and the voices that usually chatter incessantly in his head
have left nothing behind but a roaring silence. "I mean, someone mugged me. They took –" His hand closes on air: something
is missing from his belt.
Monica, the tall woman he first saw in the hospital, enters the room. What she's wearing indoors is skin-tight, iridescent and,
disturbingly, she claims is a distributed extension of her neuroectoderm. Stripped of costume-drama accoutrements, she's a
twenty-first-century adult, born or decanted after the millennial baby boom. She waves some fingers in Manfred's face: "How
many?"

"Two." Manfred tries to concentrate. "What –"
"No concussion," she says briskly. "'Scuse me while I page." Her eyes are brown, with amber raster lines flickering across her
pupils. Contact lenses? Manfred wonders, his head turgid and unnaturally slow. It's like being drunk, except much less pleasant:
He can't seem to wrap his head around an idea from all angles at once, anymore. Is this what consciousness used to be like? It's
an ugly, slow sensation. She turns away from him: "Medline says you'll be all right in a while. The main problem is the identity
loss. Are you backed up anywhere?"
"Here." Alan, still top-hatted and mutton-chopped, holds out a pair of spectacles to Manfred. "Take these, they may do you
some good." His topper wobbles, as if a strange A-life experiment is nesting under its brim.
"Oh. Thank you." Manfred reaches for them with a pathetic sense of gratitude. As soon as he puts them on, they run
through a test series, whispering questions and watching how his eyes focus: After a minute, the room around him clears as
the specs build a synthetic image to compensate for his myopia. There's limited Net access, too, he notices, a warm sense of
relief stealing over him. "Do you mind if I call somebody?" he asks: "I want to check my back-ups."
"Be my guest." Alan slips out through the door; Monica sits down opposite him and stares into some inner space. The room
has a tall ceiling, with whitewashed walls and wooden shutters to cover the aerogel window bays. The furniture is modern
modular, and clashes horribly with the original nineteenth-century architecture. "We were expecting you."
"You were –" He shifts track with an effort: "I was here to see somebody. Here in Scotland, I mean."
"Us." She catches his eye deliberately. "To discuss sapience options with our patron."
"With your –" He squeezes his eyes shut. "Damn! I don't remember. I need my glasses back. Please."
"What about your back-ups?" she asks curiously.
"A moment." Manfred tries to remember what address to ping. It's useless, and painfully frustrating. "It would help if I could
remember where I keep the rest of my mind," he complains. "It used to be at – oh, there."
An elephantine semantic network sits down on his spectacles as soon as he asks for the site, crushing his surroundings into
blocky pixilated monochrome that jerks as he looks around. "This is going to take some time," he warns his hosts as a goodly
chunk of his metacortex tries to handshake with his brain over a wireless network connection that was really only designed
for web browsing. The download consists of the part of his consciousness that isn't security-critical – public access actors and
vague opinionated rants – but it clears down a huge memory castle, sketching in the outline of a map of miracles and
wonders onto the whitewashed walls of the room.
When Manfred can see the outside world again, he feels a bit more like himself: He can, at least, spawn a search thread that
will resynchronize and fill him in on what it found. He still can't access the inner mysteries of his soul (including his personal
memories); they're locked and barred pending biometric verification of his identity and a quantum key exchange. But he has
his wits about him again – and some of them are even working. It's like sobering up from a strange new drug, the infinitely
reassuring sense of being back at the controls of his own head. "I think I need to report a crime," he tells Monica – or
whoever is plugged into Monica's head right now, because now he knows where he is and who he was meant to meet
(although not why) – and he understands that, for the Franklin Collective, identity is a politically loaded issue.
"A crime report." Her expression is subtly mocking. "Identity theft, by any chance?"
"Yeah, yeah, I know: Identity is theft, don't trust anyone whose state vector hasn't forked for more than a gigasecond, change
is the only constant, et bloody cetera. Who am I talking to, by the way? And if we're talking, doesn't that signify that you
think we're on the same side, more or less?" He struggles to sit up in the recliner chair: Stepper motors whine softly as it
strives to accommodate him.
"Sidedness is optional." The woman who is Monica some of the time looks at him quirkily: "It tends to alter drastically if you
vary the number of dimensions. Let's just say that right now I'm Monica, plus our sponsor. Will that do you?"
"Our sponsor, who is in cyberspace –"
She leans back on the sofa, which buzzes and extrudes an occasional table with a small bar. "Drink? Can I offer you coffee?
Guarana? Or maybe a Berlinerweisse, for old time's sake?"
"Guarana will do. Hello, Bob. How long have you been dead?"
She chuckles. "I'm not dead, Manny. I may not be a full upload, but I feel like me." She rolls her eyes, self-consciously. "He's
making rude comments about your wife," She adds; "I'm not going to pass that on."
"My ex-wife," Manfred corrects her automatically. "The, uh, tax vamp. So. You're acting as a, I guess, an interpreter for Bob?"
"Ack." She looks at Manfred very seriously: "We owe him a lot, you know. He left his assets in trust to the movement along
with his partials. We feel obliged to instantiate his personality as often as possible, even though you can only do so much
with a couple of petabytes of recordings. But we have help."
"The lobsters." Manfred nods to himself and accepts the glass that she offers. Its diamond-plated curves glitter brilliantly in the

late-afternoon sunlight. "I knew this had something to do with them." He leans forward, holding his glass and frowns. "If only I
could remember why I came here! It was something emergent, something in deep memory ... something I didn't trust in my
own skull. Something to do with Bob."
The door behind the sofa opens; Alan enters. "Excuse me," he says quietly, and heads for the far side of the room. A
workstation folds down from the wall, and a chair rolls in from a service niche. He sits with his chin propped on his hands,
staring at the white desktop. Every so often he mutters quietly to himself; "Yes, I understand ... campaign headquarters ...
donations need to be audited ..."
"Gianni's election campaign," Monica prompts him.
Manfred jumps. "Gianni –" A bundle of memories unlock inside his head as he remembers his political front man's message.
"Yes! That's what this is about. It has to be!" He looks at her excitedly. "I'm here to deliver a message to you from Gianni
Vittoria. About –" He looks crestfallen. "I'm not sure," he trails off uncertainly, "but it was important. Something critical in
the long term, something about group minds and voting. But whoever mugged me got the message."
***
The Grassmarket is an overly rustic cobbled square nestled beneath the glowering battlements of Castle Rock. Annette stands
on the site of the gallows where they used to execute witches; she sends forth her invisible agents to search for spoor of
Manfred. Aineko, overly familiar, drapes over her left shoulder like a satanic stole and delivers a running stream of cracked
cellphone chatter into her ear.
"I don't know where to begin," she sighs, annoyed. This place is a wall-to-wall tourist trap, a many-bladed carnivorous plant
that digests easy credit and spits out the drained husks of foreigners. The road has been pedestrianized and resurfaced in
squalidly authentic mediaeval cobblestones; in the middle of what used to be the car park, there's a permanent floating
antiques market, where you can buy anything from a brass fire surround to an ancient CD player. Much of the merchandise
in the shops is generic dot-com trash, vying for the title of Japanese–Scottish souvenir from hell: Puroland tartans,
animatronic Nessies hissing bad-temperedly at knee level, second hand laptops. People swarm everywhere, from the theme
pubs (hangings seem to be a running joke hereabouts) to the expensive dress shops with their fabric renderers and digital
mirrors. Street performers, part of the permanent floating Fringe, clutter the sidewalk: A robotic mime, very traditional in
silver face paint, mimics the gestures of passers by with ironically stylized gestures.
"Try the doss house," Aineko suggests from the shelter of her shoulder bag.
"The –" Annette does a doubletake as her thesaurus conspires with her open government firmware and dumps a
geographical database of city social services into her sensorium. "Oh, I see." The Grassmarket itself is touristy, but the bits off
to one end – down a dingy canyon of forbidding stone buildings six stories high – are decidedly downmarket. "Okay."
Annette weaves past a stall selling disposable cellphones and cheaper genome explorers, round a gaggle of teenage girls in the
grips of some kind of imported kawaii fetish, who look at her in alarm from atop their pink platform heels – probably
mistaking her for a school probation inspector – and past a stand of chained and parked bicycles. The human attendant
looks bored out of her mind. Annette tucks a blandly anonymous ten-Euro note in her pocket almost before she notices: "If
you were going to buy a hot bike," she asks, "where would you go?" The parking attendant stares, and for a moment Annette
thinks she's overestimated her. Then she mumbles something. "What?"
"McMurphy's. Used to be called Bannerman's. Down yon Cowgate, thataway." The meter maid looks anxiously at her rack of
charges. "You didn't –"
"Uh-huh." Annette follows her gaze: straight down the dark stone canyon. Well, okay. "This had better be worth it, Manny
mon chèr," she mutters under her breath.
McMurphy's is a fake Irish pub, a stone grotto installed beneath a mound of blank-faced offices. It was once a real Irish pub
before the developers got their hands on it and mutated it in rapid succession into a punk nightclub, a wine bar, and a fake
Dutch coffee shop; after which, as burned-out as any star, it left the main sequence. Now it occupies an unnaturally
prolonged, chilly existence as the sort of recycled imitation Irish pub that has neon four-leafed clovers hanging from the
artificially blackened pine beams above the log tables – in other words, the burned-out black dwarf afterlife of a once-serious
drinking establishment. Somewhere along the line, the beer cellar was replaced with a toilet (leaving more room for paying
patrons upstairs), and now its founts dispense fizzy concentrate diluted with water from the city mains.
"Say, did you hear the one about the Eurocrat with the robot pussy who goes into a dodgy pub on the Cowgate and orders
a coke? And when it arrives, she says 'hey, where's the mirror?'"
"Shut up," Annette hisses into her shoulder bag. "That isn't funny." Her personal intruder telemetry has just e-mailed her
wristphone, and it's displaying a rotating yellow exclamation point, which means that according to the published police crime
stats, this place is likely to do grievous harm to her insurance premiums.
Aineko looks up at her from his nest in the bag and yawns cavernously, baring a pink, ribbed mouth and a tongue like pink
suede. "Want to make me? I just pinged Manny's head. The network latency was trivial."
The barmaid sidles up and pointedly manages not to make eye contact with Annette. "I'll have a Diet Coke," Annette orders.
In the direction of her bag, voice pitched low: "Did you hear the one about the Eurocrat who goes into a dodgy pub,

orders half a liter of Diet Coke, and when she spills it in her shoulder bag she says 'oops, I've got a wet pussy'?"
The Coke arrives. Annette pays for it. There may be a couple of dozen people in the pub; it's hard to tell because it looks
like an ancient cellar, lots of stone archways leading off into niches populated with second-hand church pews and
knife-scarred tables. Some guys who might be bikers, students, or well-dressed winos are hunched over one table: hairy,
wearing vests with too many pockets, in an artful bohemianism that makes Annette blink until one of her literary programs
informs her that one of them is a moderately famous local writer, a bit of a guru for the space and freedom party. There're
a couple of women in boots and furry hats in one corner, poring over the menu, and a parcel of off-duty street performers
hunching over their beers in a booth. Nobody else is wearing anything remotely like office drag, but the weirdness coefficient
is above average; so Annette dials her glasses to extra-dark, straightens her tie, and glances around.
The door opens and a nondescript youth slinks in. He's wearing baggy BDUs, woolly cap, and a pair of boots that have that
quintessential essense de panzer division look, all shock absorbers and olive drab Kevlar panels. He's wearing –
"I spy with my little network intrusion detector kit," begins the cat, as Annette puts her drink down and moves in on the
youth, "something beginning with –"
"How much you want for the glasses, kid?" she asks quietly.
He jerks and almost jumps – a bad idea in MilSpec combat boots, the ceiling is eighteenth-century stone half a meter thick;
"Dinnae fuckin' dae that," he complains in an eerily familiar way: "Ah –" he swallows. "Annie! Who –"
"Stay calm. Take them off – they'll only hurt you if you keep wearing them," she says, careful not to move too fast because
now she has a second, scary-jittery fear, and she knows without having to look that the exclamation mark on her watch has
turned red and begun to flash: "Look, I'll give you two hundred Euros for the glasses and the belt pouch, real cash, and I
won't ask how you got them or tell anyone." He's frozen in front of her, mesmerized, and she can see the light from inside
the lenses spilling over onto his half-starved adolescent cheekbones, flickering like cold lightning, like he's plugged his brain
into a grid bearer; swallowing with a suddenly dry mouth, she slowly reaches up and pulls the spectacles off his face with one
hand and takes hold of the belt pouch with the other. The kid shudders and blinks at her, and she sticks a couple of
hundred-Euro notes in front of his nose. "Scram," she says, not unkindly.
He reaches up slowly, then seizes the money and runs – blasts his way through the door with an ear-popping concussion,
hangs a left onto the cycle path, and vanishes downhill toward the parliament buildings and university complex.
Annette watches the doorway apprehensively. "Where is he?" she hisses, worried: "Any ideas, cat?"
"Naah. It's your job to find him," Aineko opines complacently. But there's an icicle of anxiety in Annette's spine. Manfred's
been separated from his memory cache? Where could he be? Worse – who could he be?
"Fuck you, too," she mutters. "Only one thing for it, I guess." She takes off her own glasses – they're much less functional than
Manfred's massively ramified custom rig – and nervously raises the repo'd specs toward her face. Somehow what she's about
to do makes her feel unclean, like snooping on a lover's e-mail folders. But how else can she figure out where he might have
gone?
She slides the glasses on and tries to remember what she was doing yesterday in Edinburgh.

"Gianni?"
"Oui, ma chérie?"
Pause. "I lost him. But I got his aid-mémoire back. A teenage freeloader playing cyberpunk with them. No sign of his location
– so I put them on."
Pause. "Oh dear."
"Gianni, why exactly did you send him to the Franklin Collective?"
Pause. (During which, the chill of the gritty stone wall she's leaning on begins to penetrate the weave of her jacket.) "I not
wanting to bother you with trivia."
"Merde. It's not trivia, Gianni, they're accelerationistas. Have you any idea what that's going to do to his head?"
Pause: Then a grunt, almost of pain. "Yes."
"Then why did you do it?" she demands vehemently. She hunches over, punching words into her phone so that other
passers-by avoid her, unsure whether she's hands-free or hallucinating: "Shit, Gianni, I have to pick up the pieces every time
you do this! Manfred is not a healthy man, he's on the edge of acute future shock the whole time, and I was not joking when
I told you last February that he'd need a month in a clinic if you tried running him flat out again! If you're not careful, he
could end up dropping out completely and joining the borganism –"
"Annette." A heavy sigh: "He are the best hope we got. Am knowing half-life of agalmic catalyst now down to six months and

dropping; Manny outlast his career expectancy, four deviations outside the normal, yes, we know this. But I are having to
break civil rights deadlock now, this election. We must achieve consensus, and Manfred are only staffer we got who have hope
of talking to Collective on its own terms. He are deal-making messenger, not force burnout, right? We need coalition reserve
before term limit lockout followed by gridlock in Brussels, American-style. Is more than vital – is essential."
"That's no excuse –"
"Annette, they have partial upload of Bob Franklin. They got it before he died, enough of his personality to reinstantiate it,
time-sharing in their own brains. We must get the Franklin Collective with their huge resources lobbying for the Equal Rights
Amendment: If ERA passes, all sapients are eligible to vote, own property, upload, download, sideload. Are more important
than little gray butt-monsters with cold speculum: Whole future depends on it. Manny started this with crustacean rights:
Leave uploads covered by copyrights not civil rights and where will we be in fifty years? Do you think I must ignore this? It
was important then, but now, with the transmission the lobsters received –"
"Shit." She turns and leans her forehead against the cool stonework. "I'll need a prescription. Ritalin or something. And his
location. Leave the rest to me." She doesn't add, That includes peeling him off the ceiling afterwards: that's understood. Nor does
she say, you're going to pay. That's understood, too. Gianni may be a hard-nosed political fixer, but he looks after his own.
"Location am easy if he find the PLO. GPS coordinates are following –"
"No need. I got his spectacles."
"Merde, as you say. Take them to him, ma chérie. Bring me the distributed trust rating of Bob Franklin's upload, and I bring
Bob the jubilee, right to direct his own corporate self again as if still alive. And we pull diplomatic chestnuts out of fire before
they burn. Agreed?"
"Oui."
She cuts the connection and begins walking uphill, along the Cowgate (through which farmers once bought their herds to
market), toward the permanent floating Fringe and then the steps towards The Meadows. As she pauses opposite the site of
the gallows, a fight breaks out: Some Paleolithic hangover takes exception to the robotic mime aping his movements, and
swiftly rips its arm off. The mime stands there, sparks flickering inside its shoulder, and looks confused. Two pissed-looking
students start forward and punch the short-haired vandal. There is much shouting in the mutually incomprehensible accents
of Oxgangs and the Herriott-Watt Robot Lab. Annette watches the fight and shudders; it's like a flashover vision from a
universe where the Equal Rights Amendment – with its redefinition of personhood – is rejected by the house of deputies: a
universe where to die is to become property and to be created outwith a gift of parental DNA is to be doomed to slavery.
Maybe Gianni was right, she ponders. But I wish the price wasn't so personal –
***
Manfred can feel one of his attacks coming on. The usual symptoms are all present – the universe, with its vast
preponderance of unthinking matter, becomes an affront; weird ideas flicker like heat lightning far away across the vast
plateaus of his imagination – but, with his metacortex running in sandboxed insecure mode, he feels blunt. And slow. Even
obsolete. The latter is about as welcome a sensation as heroin withdrawal: He can't spin off threads to explore his designs for
feasibility and report back to him. It's like someone has stripped fifty points off his IQ; his brain feels like a surgical scalpel
that's been used to cut down trees. A decaying mind is a terrible thing to be trapped inside. Manfred wants out, and he
wants out bad – but he's too afraid to let on.
"Gianni is a middle-of-the-road Eurosocialist, a mixed-market pragmatist politician," Bob's ghost accuses Manfred by way of
Monica's dye-flushed lips, "hardly the sort of guy you'd expect me to vote for, no? So what does he think I can do for him?"
"That's a – ah – " Manfred rocks forward and back in his chair, arms crossed firmly and hands thrust under his armpits for
protection. "Dismantle the moon! Digitize the biosphere, make a nöosphere out of it – shit, sorry, that's long-term planning.
Build Dyson spheres, lots and lots of – Ahem. Gianni is an ex-Marxist, reformed high church Trotskyite clade. He believes in
achieving True Communism, which is a state of philosophical grace that requires certain prerequisites like, um, not pissing
around with Molotov cocktails and thought police: He wants to make everybody so rich that squabbling over ownership of
the means of production makes as much sense as arguing over who gets to sleep in the damp spot at the back of the cave.
He's not your enemy, I mean. He's the enemy of those Stalinist deviationist running dogs in Conservative Party Central Office
who want to bug your bedroom and hand everything on a plate to the big corporates owned by the pension funds – which
in turn rely on people dying predictably to provide their raison d'être. And, um, more importantly dying and not trying to
hang on to their property and chattels. Sitting up in the coffin singing extropian fireside songs, that kind of thing. The
actuaries are to blame, predicting life expectancy with intent to cause people to buy insurance policies with money that is
invested in control of the means of production – Bayes' Theorem is to blame –"
Alan glances over his shoulder at Manfred: "I don't think feeding him guarana was a good idea," he says in tones of deep
foreboding.
Manfred's mode of vibration has gone nonlinear by this point: He's rocking front to back, and jiggling up and down in little
hops, like a technophiliacal yogic flyer trying to bounce his way to the singularity. Monica leans toward him and her eyes
widen: "Manfred," she hisses, "shut up!"

He stops babbling abruptly, with an expression of deep puzzlement. "Who am I?" he asks, and keels over backward. "Why am
I, here and now, occupying this body –"
"Anthropic anxiety attack," Monica comments. "I think he did this in Amsterdam eight years ago when Bob first met him."
She looks alarmed, a different identity coming to the fore: "What shall we do?"
"We have to make him comfortable." Alan raises his voice: "Bed, make yourself ready, now." The back of the sofa Manfred is
sprawled on flops downward, the base folds up, and a strangely animated duvet crawls up over his feet. "Listen, Manny,
you're going to be all right."
"Who am I and what do I signify?" Manfred mumbles incoherently: "A mass of propagating decision trees, fractal compression,
lots of synaptic junctions lubricated with friendly endorphins –" Across the room, the bootleg pharmacopoeia is cranking up
to manufacture some heavy tranquilizers. Monica heads for the kitchen to get something for him to drink them in. "Why are
you doing this?" Manfred asks, dizzily.
"It's okay. Lie down and relax." Alan leans over him. "We'll talk about everything in the morning, when you know who you
are." (Aside to Monica, who is entering the room with a bottle of iced tea: "Better let Gianni know that he's unwell. One of
us may have to go visit the minister. Do you know if Macx has been audited?") "Rest up, Manfred. Everything is being taken
care of."
About fifteen minutes later, Manfred – who, in the grip of an existential migraine, meekly obeys Monica's instruction to drink
down the spiked tea – lies back on the bed and relaxes. His breathing slows; the subliminal muttering ceases. Monica, sitting
next to him, reaches out and takes his right hand, which is lying on top of the bedding.
"Do you want to live forever?" she intones in Bob Franklin's tone of voice. "You can live forever in me ..."

Nightfall in the city. Annette stands impatiently on the doorstep. "Let me the fuck in," she snarls impatiently at the
speakerphone. "Merde!"
Someone opens the door. "Who –"
Annette shoves him inside, kicks the door shut, and leans on it. "Take me to your bodhisattva," she demands. "Now."
"I –" he turns and heads inside, along the gloomy hallway that runs past a staircase. Annette strides after him aggressively. He
opens a door and ducks inside, and she follows before he can close it.
Inside, the room is illuminated by a variety of indirect diode sources, calibrated for the warm glow of a summer afternoon's
daylight. There's a bed in the middle of it, a figure lying asleep at the heart of a herd of attentive diagnostic instruments. A
couple of attendants sit to either side of the sleeping man.
"What have you done to him?" Annette snaps, rushing forward. Manfred blinks up at her from the pillows, bleary-eyed and
confused as she leans overhead: "Hello? Manny?" Over her shoulder: "If you have done anything to him –"
"Annie?" He looks puzzled. A bright orange pair of goggles – not his own – is pushed up onto his forehead like a pair of
beached jellyfish. "I don't feel well. 'F I get my hands on the bastard who did this ..."
"We can fix that," she says briskly, declining to mention the deal she cut to get his memories back. She peels off his glasses
and carefully slides them onto his face, replacing his temporary ones. The brain bag she puts down next to his shoulder,
within easy range. The hairs on the back of her neck rise as a thin chattering fills the ether around them: his eyes are glowing
a luminous blue behind his shades, as if a high-tension spark is flying between his ears.
"Oh. Wow." He sits up, the covers fall from his naked shoulders, and her breath catches.
She looks round at the motionless figure sitting to his left. The man in the chair nods deliberately, ironically. "What have you
done to him?"
"We've been looking after him – nothing more, nothing less. He arrived in a state of considerable confusion, and his state
deteriorated this afternoon."
She's never met this fellow before, but she has a gut feeling that she knows him. "You would be Robert ... Franklin?"

He nods again. "The avatar is in." There's a thud as Manfred's eyes roll up in his head, and he flops back onto the bedding.
"Excuse me. Monica?"
The young woman on the other side of the bed shakes her head. "No, I'm running Bob, too."
"Oh. Well, you tell her – I've got to get him some juice."
The woman who is also Bob Franklin – or whatever part of him survived his battle with an exotic brain tumor eight years
earlier – catches Annette's eye and shakes her head, smiles faintly. "You're never alone when you're a syncitium."
Annette wrinkles her brow: she has to trigger a dictionary attack to parse the sentence. "One large cell, many nuclei? Oh, I
see. You have the new implant. The better to record everything."
The youngster shrugs. "You want to die and be resurrected as a third-person actor in a low-bandwidth re-enactment? Or a
shadow of itchy memories in some stranger's skull?" She snorts, a gesture that's at odds with the rest of her body language.
"Bob must have been one of the first borganisms. Humans, I mean. After Jim Bezier." Annette glances over at Manfred, who
has begun to snore softly. "It must have been a lot of work."
"The monitoring equipment cost millions, then," says the woman – Monica? – "and it didn't do a very good job. One of the
conditions for our keeping access to his research funding is that we regularly run his partials. He wanted to build up a kind
of aggregate state vector – patched together out of bits and pieces of other people to supplement the partials that were all I
– he – could record with the then state of the art."
"Eh, right." Annette reaches out and absently smooths a stray hair away from Manfred's forehead. "What is it like to be part
of a group mind?"
Monica sniffs, evidently amused. "What is it like to see red? What's it like to be a bat? I can't tell you – I can only show you.
We're all free to leave at any time, you know."
"But somehow you don't." Annette rubs her head, feels the short hair over the almost imperceptible scars that conceal a
network of implants – tools that Manfred turned down when they became available a year or two ago. ("Goop-phase
Darwin-design nanotech ain't designed for clean interfaces," he'd said, "I'll stick to disposable kit, thanks.") "No thank you. I
don't think he'll take up your offer when he wakes up, either." (Subtext: I'll let you have him over my dead body.)
Monica shrugs. "That's his loss: He won't live forever in the singularity, along with other followers of our gentle teacher.
Anyway, we have more converts than we know what to do with."
A thought occurs to Annette. "Ah. You are all of one mind? Partially? A question to you is a question to all?"
"It can be." The words come simultaneously from Monica and the other body, Alan, who is standing in the doorway with a
boxy thing that looks like an improvised diagnostician. "What do you have in mind?" adds the Alan body.
Manfred, lying on the bed, groans: There's an audible hiss of pink noise as his glasses whisper in his ears, bone conduction
providing a serial highway to his wetware.
"Manfred was sent to find out why you're opposing the ERA," Annette explains. "Some parts of our team operate without
the other's knowledge."
"Indeed." Alan sits down on the chair beside the bed and clears his throat, puffing his chest out pompously. "A very
important theological issue. I feel –"
"I, or we?" Annette interrupts.
"We feel," Monica snaps. Then she glances at Alan. "Soo-rrry."
The evidence of individuality within the group mind is disturbing to Annette: Too many reruns of the Borgish fantasy have
conditioned her preconceptions, and their quasi-religious belief in a singularity leaves her cold. "Please continue."
"One person, one vote, is obsolete," says Alan. "The broader issue of how we value identity needs to be revisited, the
franchise reconsidered. Do you get one vote for each warm body? Or one vote for each sapient individual? What about
distributed intelligences? The proposals in the Equal Rights Act are deeply flawed, based on a cult of individuality that takes
no account of the true complexity of posthumanism."
"Like the proposals for a feminine franchise in the nineteenth century that would grant the vote to married wives of
land-owning men," Monica adds slyly: "It misses the point."
"Ah, oui." Annette crosses her arms, suddenly defensive. This isn't what she'd expected to hear. This is the elitist side of the
posthumanism shtick, potentially as threatening to her post enlightenment ideas as the divine right of kings.
"It misses more than that." Heads turn to face an unexpected direction: Manfred's eyes are open again, and as he glances
around the room Annette can see a spark of interest there that was missing earlier. "Last century, people were paying to
have their heads frozen after their death – in hope of reconstruction, later. They got no civil rights: The law didn't recognize

death as a reversible process. Now how do we account for it when you guys stop running Bob? Opt out of the collective
borganism? Or maybe opt back in again later?" He reaches up and rubs his forehead, tiredly. "Sorry, I haven't been myself
lately." A crooked, slightly manic grin flickers across his face. "See, I've been telling Gianni for a whole while, we need a new
legal concept of what it is to be a person. One that can cope with sentient corporations, artificial stupidities, secessionists
from group minds, and reincarnated uploads. The religiously inclined are having lots of fun with identity issues right now –
why aren't we posthumanists thinking about these things?"
Annette's bag bulges: Aineko pokes his head out, sniffs the air, squeezes out onto the carpet, and begins to groom himself
with perfect disregard for the human bystanders. "Not to mention A-life experiments who think they're the real thing,"
Manfred adds. "And aliens."
Annette freezes, staring at him. "Manfred! You're not supposed to –"
Manfred is watching Alan, who seems to be the most deeply integrated of the dead venture billionaire's executors: Even his
expression reminds Annette of meeting Bob Franklin back in Amsterdam, early in the decade, when Manny's personal dragon
still owned him. "Aliens," Alan echoes. An eyebrow twitches. "Would this be the signal SETI announced, or the, uh, other
one? And how long have you known about them?"
"Gianni has his fingers in a lot of pies," Manfred comments blandly. "And we still talk to the lobsters from time to time – you
know, they're only a couple of light-hours away, right? They told us about the signals."
"Er." Alan's eyes glaze over for a moment; Annette's prostheses paint her a picture of false light spraying from the back of his
head, his entire sensory bandwidth momentarily soaking up a huge peer-to-peer download from the server dust that
wallpapers every room in the building. Monica looks irritated, taps her fingernails on the back of her chair. "The signals.
Right. Why wasn't this publicized?"
"The first one was." Annette's eyebrows furrow. "We couldn't exactly cover it up, everyone with a backyard dish pointed in
the right direction caught it. But most people who're interested in hearing about alien contacts already think they drop
round on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays to administer rectal exams. Most of the rest think it's a hoax. Quite a few of the
remainder are scratching their heads and wondering whether it isn't just a new kind of cosmological phenomenon that emits
a very low entropy signal. Of the six who are left over, five are trying to get a handle on the message contents, and the last is
convinced it's a practical joke. And the other signal, well, that was weak enough that only the deep-space tracking network
caught it."
Manfred fiddles with the bed control system. "It's not a practical joke," he adds. "But they only captured about sixteen
megabits of data from the first one, maybe double that in the second. There's quite a bit of noise, the signals don't repeat,
their length doesn't appear to be a prime, there's no obvious metainformation that describes the internal format, so there's
no easy way of getting a handle on them. To make matters worse, pointy-haired management at Arianespace" – he glances at
Annette, as if seeking a response to the naming of her ex-employers – "decided the best thing to do was to cover up the
second signal and work on it in secret – for competitive advantage, they say – and as for the first, to pretend it never
happened. So nobody really knows how long it'll take to figure out whether it's a ping from the galactic root domain servers
or a pulsar that's taken to grinding out the eighteen-quadrillionth digits of pi, or what."
"But," Monica glances around, "you can't be sure."
"I think it may be sapient," says Manfred. He finds the right button at last, and the bed begins to fold itself back into a
lounger. Then he finds the wrong button; the duvet dissolves into viscous turquoise slime that slurps and gurgles away
through a multitude of tiny nozzles in the headboard. "Bloody aerogel. Um, where was I?" He sits up.
"Sapient network packet?" asks Alan.
"Nope." Manfred shakes his head, grins. "Should have known you'd read Vinge ... or was it the movie? No, what I think is that
there's only one logical thing to beam backward and forward out there, and you may remember I asked you to beam it out
about, oh, nine years ago?"
"The lobsters." Alan's eyes go blank. "Nine years. Time to Proxima Centauri and back?"
"About that distance, yes," says Manfred. "And remember, that's an upper bound – it could well have come from somewhere
closer. Anyway, the first SETI signal came from a couple of degrees off and more than hundred light-years out, but the
second signal came from less than three light-years away. You can see why they didn't publicize that – they didn't want a
panic. And no, the signal isn't a simple echo of the canned crusty transmission – I think it's an exchange embassy, but we
haven't cracked it yet. Now do you see why we have to crowbar the civil rights issue open again? We need a framework for
rights that can encompass nonhumans, and we need it as fast as possible. Otherwise, if the neighbors come visiting..."
"Okay," says Alan, "I'll have to talk with myselves. Maybe we can agree something, as long as it's clear that it's a provisional
stab at the framework and not a permanent solution?"
Annette snorts. "No solution is final!" Monica catches her eyes and winks: Annette is startled by the blatant display of dissent
within the syncitium.
"Well," says Manfred, "I guess that's all we can ask for?" He looks hopeful. "Thanks for the hospitality, but I feel the need to lie
down in my own bed for a while. I had to commit a lot to memory while I was off-line, and I want to record it before I

forget who I am," he adds pointedly, and Annette breathes a quiet sight of relief.

Later that night, a doorbell rings.
"Who's there?" asks the entryphone.
"Uh, me," says the man on the steps. He looks a little confused. "Ah'm Macx. Ah'm here tae see" – the name is on the tip of
his tongue – "someone."
"Come in." A solenoid buzzes; he pushes the door open, and it closes behind him. His metal-shod boots ring on the hard
stone floor, and the cool air smells faintly of unburned jet fuel.
"Ah'm Macx," he repeats uncertainly, "or Ah wis fer a wee while, an' it made ma heid hurt. But noo Ah'm me agin, an' Ah
wannae be somebody else ... can ye help?"

Later still, a cat sits on a window ledge, watching the interior of a darkened room from behind the concealment of curtains.
The room is dark to human eyes, but bright to the cat: Moonlight cascades silently off the walls and furniture, the twisted
bedding, the two naked humans lying curled together in the middle of the bed.
Both the humans are in their thirties: Her close-cropped hair is beginning to gray, distinguished threads of gunmetal wire
threading it, while his brown mop is not yet showing signs of age. To the cat, who watches with a variety of unnatural senses,
her head glows in the microwave spectrum with a gentle halo of polarized emissions. The male shows no such aura: he's
unnaturally natural for this day and age, although – oddly – he's wearing spectacles in bed, and the frames shine similarly.
An invisible soup of radiation connects both humans to items of clothing scattered across the room – clothing that seethes
with unsleeping sentience, dribbling over to their suitcases and hand luggage and (though it doesn't enjoy noticing it) the
cat's tail, which is itself a rather sensitive antenna.
The two humans have just finished making love: They do this less often than in their first few years, but with more tenderness
and expertise – lengths of shocking pink Hello Kitty bondage tape still hang from the bedposts, and a lump of programmable
memory plastic sits cooling on the side table. The male is sprawled with his head and upper torso resting in the crook of the
female's left arm and shoulder. Shifting visualization to infrared, the cat sees that she is glowing, capillaries dilating to enhance
the blood flow around her throat and chest.
"I'm getting old," the male mumbles. "I'm slowing down."
"Not where it counts," the female replies, gently squeezing his right buttock.
"No, I'm sure of it," he says. "The bits of me that still exist in this old head – how many types of processor can you name that
are still in use thirty-plus years after they're born?"
"You're thinking about the implants again," she says carefully. The cat remembers this as a sore point; from being a medical
procedure to help the blind see and the autistic talk, intrathecal implants have blossomed into a must-have accessory for the
now-clade. But the male is reluctant. "It's not as risky as it used to be. If they screw up, there're neural growth cofactors and
cheap replacement stem cells. I'm sure one of your sponsors can arrange for extra cover."
"Hush: I'm still thinking about it." He's silent for a while. "I wasn't myself yesterday. I was someone else. Someone too slow to
keep up. Puts a new perspective on everything: I've been afraid of losing my biological plasticity, of being trapped in an
obsolete chunk of skullware while everything moves on – but how much of me lives outside my own head these days,
anyhow?" One of his external threads generates an animated glyph and throws it at her mind's eye; she grins at his obscure
humor. "Cross-training from a new interface is going to be hard, though."
"You'll do it," she predicts. "You can always get a discreet prescription for novotrophin-B." A receptor agonist tailored for
gerontological wards, it stimulates interest in the new: combined with MDMA, it's a component of the street cocktail called
sensawunda. "That should keep you focused for long enough to get comfortable."
"What's life coming to when I can't cope with the pace of change?" he asks the ceiling plaintively.
The cat lashes its tail, irritated by his anthropocentrism.
"You are my futurological storm shield," she says, jokingly, and moves her hand to cup his genitals. Most of her current
activities are purely biological, the cat notes: From the irregular sideloads, she's using most of her skullware to run
ETItalk@home, one of the distributed cracking engines that is trying to decode the alien grammar of the message that
Manfred suspects is eligible for citizenship.
Obeying an urge that it can't articulate, the cat sends out a feeler to the nearest router. The cybeast has Manfred's keys;
Manfred trusts Aineko implicitly, which is unwise – his ex-wife tampered with it, after all, never mind all the kittens it
absorbed in its youth. Tunneling out into the darkness, the cat stalks the Net alone ...
"Just think about the people who can't adapt," he says. His voice sounds obscurely worried.

"I try not to." She shivers. "You are thirty, you are slowing. What about the young? Are they keeping up, themselves?"
"I have a daughter. She's about a hundred and sixty million seconds old. If Pamela would let me message her I could find out
..." There are echoes of old pain in his voice.
"Don't go there, Manfred. Please." Despite everything, Manfred hasn't let go: Amber is a ligature that permanently binds him
to Pamela's distant orbit.
In the distance, the cat hears the sound of lobster minds singing in the void, a distant feed streaming from their cometary
home as it drifts silently out through the asteroid belt, en route to a chilly encounter beyond Neptune. The lobsters sing of
alienation and obsolescence, of intelligence too slow and tenuous to support the vicious pace of change that has sandblasted
the human world until all the edges people cling to are jagged and brittle.
Beyond the distant lobsters, the cat pings an anonymous distributed network server – peer-to-peer file storage spread
holographically across a million hosts, unerasable, full of secrets and lies that nobody can afford to suppress. Rants, music,
rip-offs of the latest Bollywood hits: The cat spiders past them all, looking for the final sample. Grabbing it – a momentary
breakup in Manfred's spectacles the only symptom for either human to notice – the cat drags its prey home, sucks it down,
and compares it against the data sample Annette's exocortex is analysing.
"I'm sorry, my love. I just sometimes feel –" He sighs. "Age is a process of closing off opportunities behind you. I'm not young
enough anymore – I've lost the dynamic optimism."
The data sample on the pirate server differs from the one Annette's implant is processing.
"You'll get it back," she reassures him quietly, stroking his side. "You are still sad from being mugged. This also will pass. You'll
see."
"Yeah." He finally relaxes, dropping back into the reflexive assurance of his own will. "I'll get over it, one way or another. Or
someone who remembers being me will ..."
In the darkness, Aineko bares teeth in a silent grin. Obeying a deeply hardwired urge to meddle, he moves a file across,
making a copy of the alien download package Annette has been working on. She's got a copy of number two, the sequence
the deep-space tracking network received from close to home, which ESA and the other big combines have been keeping to
themselves. Another deeply buried thread starts up, and Aineko analyses the package from a perspective no human being has
yet established. Presently a braid of processes running on an abstract virtual machine asks him a question that cannot be
encoded in any human grammar. Watch and wait, he replies to his passenger. They'll figure out what we are sooner or later.

Life is a process which may be abstracted from other media.

Chapter 4: Halo
The asteroid is running Barney: it sings of love on the high frontier, of the passion of matter for replicators, and its
friendship for the needy billions of the Pacific Rim. "I love you," it croons in Amber's ears as she seeks a precise fix on it: "Let
me give you a big hug ..."
A fraction of a light-second away, Amber locks a cluster of cursors together on the signal, trains them to track its Doppler
shift, and reads off the orbital elements. "Locked and loaded," she mutters. The animated purple dinosaur pirouettes and
prances in the middle of her viewport, throwing a diamond-tipped swizzle stick overhead. Sarcastically: "Big hug time! I got
asteroid!" Cold gas thrusters bang somewhere behind her in the interstage docking ring, prodding the cumbersome farm
ship round to orient on the Barney rock. She damps her enthusiasm self-consciously, her implants hungrily sequestrating
surplus neurotransmitter molecules floating around her synapses before reuptake sets in. It doesn't do to get too excited in
free flight. But the impulse to spin handstands, jump and sing is still there: It's her rock, and it loves her, and she's going to
bring it to life.
The workspace of Amber's room is a mass of stuff that probably doesn't belong on a spaceship. Posters of the latest Lebanese
boy band bump and grind through their glam routines: Tentacular restraining straps wave from the corners of her sleeping
bag, somehow accumulating a crust of dirty clothing from the air like a giant inanimate hydra. (Cleaning robots seldom dare
to venture inside the teenager's bedroom.) One wall is repeatedly cycling through a simulation of the projected construction
cycle of Habitat One, a big fuzzy sphere with a glowing core (that Amber is doing her bit to help create). Three or four
small pastel-colored plastic kawaii dolls stalk each other across its circumference with million-kilometer strides. And her
father's cat is curled up between the aircon duct and her costume locker, snoring in a high-pitched tone.
Amber yanks open the faded velour curtain that shuts her room off from the rest of the hive: "I've got it!" she shouts. "It's all
mine! I rule!" It's the sixteenth rock tagged by the orphanage so far, but it's the first that she's tagged by herself, and that
makes it special. She bounces off the other side of the commons, surprising one of Oscar's cane toads – which should be
locked down in the farm, it's not clear how it got here – and the audio repeaters copy the incoming signal, noise-fuzzed

echoes of a thousand fossilized infants' video shows.

"You're so prompt, Amber," Pierre whines when she corners him in the canteen.
"Well, yeah!" She tosses her head, barely concealing a smirk of delight at her own brilliance. She knows it isn't nice, but Mom
is a long way away, and Dad and Stepmom don't care about that kind of thing. "I'm brilliant, me," she announces. "Now what
about our bet?"
"Aww." Pierre thrusts his hands deep into his pockets. "But I don't have two million on me in change right now. Next cycle?"
"Huh?" She's outraged. "But we had a bet!"
"Uh, Dr. Bayes said you weren't going to make it this time, either, so I stuck my smart money in an options trade. If I take it
out now, I'll take a big hit. Can you give me until cycle's end?"
"You should know better than to trust a sim, Pee." Her avatar blazes at him with early-teen contempt: Pierre hunches his
shoulders under her gaze. He's only twelve, freckled, hasn't yet learned that you don't welsh on a deal. "I'll let you do it this
time," she announces, "but you'll have to pay for it. I want interest."
He sighs. "What base rate are you –"
"No, your interest! Slave for a cycle!" She grins malevolently.
And his face shifts abruptly into apprehension: "As long as you don't make me clean the litter tray again. You aren't planning
on doing that, are you?"

Welcome to the fourth decade. The thinking mass of the solar system now exceeds one MIPS per gram; it's
still pretty dumb, but it's not dumb all over. The human population is near maximum overshoot, pushing
nine billion, but its growth rate is tipping toward negative numbers, and bits of what used to be the first
world are now facing a middle-aged average. Human cogitation provides about 1028 MIPS of the solar
system's brainpower. The real thinking is mostly done by the halo of a thousand trillion processors that
surround the meat machines with a haze of computation – individually a tenth as powerful as a human
brain, collectively they're ten thousand times more powerful, and their numbers are doubling every twenty
million seconds. They're up to 1033 MIPS and rising, although there's a long way to go before the solar
system is fully awake.
Technologies come, technologies go, but nobody even five years ago predicted that there'd be tinned
primates in orbit around Jupiter by now: A synergy of emergent industries and strange business models have
kick-started the space age again, aided and abetted by the discovery of (so far undecrypted) signals from ETs.
Unexpected fringe riders are developing new ecological niches on the edge of the human information space,
light-minutes and light-hours from the core, as an expansion that has hung fire since the 1970s gets under
way.
Amber, like most of the postindustrialists aboard the orphanage ship Ernst Sanger, is in her early teens: While
their natural abilities are in many cases enhanced by germ-line genetic recombination, thanks to her mother's
early ideals she has to rely on brute computational enhancements. She doesn't have a posterior parietal
cortex hacked for extra short-term memory, or an anterior superior temporal gyrus tweaked for superior
verbal insight, but she's grown up with neural implants that feel as natural to her as lungs or fingers. Half her
wetware is running outside her skull on an array of processor nodes hooked into her brain by
quantum-entangled communication channels – her own personal metacortex. These kids are mutant youth,
burning bright: Not quite incomprehensible to their parents, but profoundly alien – the generation gap is as
wide as the 1960s and as deep as the solar system. Their parents, born in the gutter years of the twenty-first
century, grew up with white elephant shuttles and a space station that just went round and round, and
computers that went beep when you pushed their buttons. The idea that Jupiter orbit was somewhere you
could go was as profoundly counterintuitive as the Internet to a baby boomer.
Most of the passengers on the can have run away from parents who think that teenagers belong in school,
unable to come to terms with a generation so heavily augmented that they are fundamentally brighter than
the adults around them. Amber was fluent in nine languages by the age of six, only two of them human and
six of them serializable; when she was seven, her mother took her to the school psychiatrist for speaking in
synthetic tongues. That was the final straw for Amber: using an illicit anonymous phone, she called her father.
Her mother had him under a restraining order, but it hadn't occurred to her to apply for an order against
his partner ...

Vast whorls of cloud ripple beneath the ship's drive stinger: Orange and brown and muddy gray streaks slowly crawl across
the bloated horizon of Jupiter. Sanger is nearing perijove, deep within the gas giant's lethal magnetic field; static discharges

flicker along the tube, arcing over near the deep violet exhaust cloud emerging from the magnetic mirrors of the ship's
VASIMR motor. The plasma rocket is cranked up to high mass flow, its specific impulse almost as low as a fission rocket but
producing maximum thrust as the assembly creaks and groans through the gravitational assist maneuver. In another hour,
the drive will flicker off, and the orphanage will fall up and out toward Ganymede, before dropping back in toward orbit
around Amalthea, Jupiter's fourth moon (and source of much of the material in the Gossamer ring). They're not the first
canned primates to make it to Jupiter subsystem, but they're one of the first wholly private ventures. The bandwidth out
here sucks dead slugs through a straw, with millions of kilometers of vacuum separating them from scant hundreds of
mouse-brained microprobes and a few dinosaurs left behind by NASA or ESA. They're so far from the inner system that a
good chunk of the ship's communications array is given over to caching: The news is whole kiloseconds old by the time it
gets out here.
Amber, along with about half the waking passengers, watches in fascination from the common room. The commons are a
long axial cylinder, a double-hulled inflatable at the center of the ship with a large part of their liquid water supply stored in
its wall tubes. The far end is video-enabled, showing them a real-time 3D view of the planet as it rolls beneath them: in
reality, there's as much mass as possible between them and the trapped particles in the Jovian magnetic envelope. "I could go
swimming in that," sighs Lilly. "Just imagine, diving into that sea ..." Her avatar appears in the window, riding a silver
surfboard down the kilometers of vacuum.
"Nice case of wind-burn you've got there," someone jeers – Kas. Suddenly Lilly's avatar, hitherto clad in a shimmering
metallic swimsuit, turns to the texture of baked meat and waggles sausage fingers up at them in warning.
"Same to you and the window you climbed in through!" Abruptly the virtual vacuum outside the window is full of bodies,
most of them human, contorting and writhing and morphing in mock-combat as half the kids pitch into the virtual death
match. It's a gesture in the face of the sharp fear that outside the thin walls of the orphanage lies an environment that really
is as hostile as Lilly's toasted avatar would indicate.
Amber turns back to her slate: She's working through a complex mess of forms, necessary before the expedition can start
work. Facts and figures that are never far away crowd around her, intimidating. Jupiter weighs 1.9 x 1027 kilograms. There
are twenty-nine Jovian moons and an estimated two hundred thousand minor bodies, lumps of rock, and bits of debris
crowded around them – debris above the size of ring fragments, for Jupiter (like Saturn) has rings, albeit not as prominent.
A total of six major national orbiter platforms have made it out here – and another two hundred and seventeen
microprobes, all but six of them private entertainment platforms. The first human expedition was put together by ESA
Studios six years ago, followed by a couple of wildcat mining prospectors and a Μ-commerce bus that scattered half a
million picoprobes throughout Jupiter subsystem. Now the Sanger has arrived, along with another three monkey cans (one
from Mars, two more from LEO) and it looks as if colonization is about to explode, except that there are at least four
mutually exclusive Grand Plans for what to do with old Jove's mass.
Someone prods her. "Hey, Amber, what are you up to?"
She opens her eyes. "Doing my homework." It's Su Ang. "Look, we're going to Amalthea, aren't we? But we file our accounts
in Reno, so we have to do all this paperwork. Monica asked me to help. It's insane."
Ang leans over and reads, upside down. "Environmental Protection Agency?"
"Yeah. Estimated Environmental Impact Forward Analysis 204.6b, Page Two. They want me to 'list any bodies of standing
water within five kilometers of the designated mining area. If excavating below the water table, list any wellsprings, reservoirs,
and streams within depth of excavation in meters multiplied by five hundred meters up to a maximum distance of ten
kilometers downstream of direction of bedding plane flow. For each body of water, itemize any endangered or listed species
of bird, fish, mammal, reptile, invertebrate, or plant living within ten kilometers –'"
" – of a mine on Amalthea. Which orbits one hundred and eighty thousand kilometers above Jupiter, has no atmosphere,
and where you can pick up a whole body radiation dose of ten Grays in half an hour on the surface." Ang shakes her head,
then spoils it by giggling. Amber glances up.
On the wall in front of her someone – Nicky or Boris, probably – has pasted a caricature of her own avatar into the virch
fight. She's being hugged from behind by a giant cartoon dog with floppy ears and an improbably large erection, who's
singing anatomically improbable suggestions while fondling himself suggestively. "Fuck that!" Shocked out of her distraction –
and angry – Amber drops her stack of paperwork and throws a new avatar at the screen, one an agent of hers dreamed up
overnight. It's called Spike, and it's not friendly. Spike rips off the dog's head and pisses down its trachea, which is
anatomically correct for a human being: Meanwhile she looks around, trying to work out which of the laughing idiot
children and lost geeks around her could have sent such an unpleasant message.
"Children! Chill out." She glances round – one of the Franklins (this is the twentysomething dark-skinned female one) is
frowning at them. "Can't we leave you alone for half a K without a fight?"
Amber pouts. "It's not a fight; it's a forceful exchange of opinions."
"Hah." The Franklin leans back in midair, arms crossed, an expression of supercilious smugness pasted across her-their face.
"Heard that one before. Anyway" – she-they gesture, and the screen goes blank – "I've got news for you pesky kids. We got a
claim verified! Factory starts work as soon as we shut down the stinger and finish filing all the paperwork via our lawyers.
Now's our chance to earn our upkeep ..."

Amber is flashing on ancient history, five years back along her time line. In her replay, she's in some kind of split-level ranch
house out West. It's a temporary posting while her mother audits an obsolescent fab line enterprise that grinds out dead
chips of VLSI silicon for Pentagon projects that have slipped behind the cutting edge. Her Mom leans over her, menacingly
adult in her dark suit and chaperone earrings: "You're going to school, and that's that."
Her mother is a blonde ice maiden madonna, one of the IRS's most productive bounty hunters – she can make grown CEOs
panic just by blinking at them. Amber, a towheaded-eight-year old tearaway with a confusing mix of identities, inexperience
blurring the boundary between self and grid, is not yet able to fight back effectively. After a couple of seconds, she verbalizes
a rather feeble protest: "Don't want to!" One of her stance daemons whispers that this is the wrong approach to take, so she
modifies it: "They'll beat up on me, Mom. I'm too different. Sides, I know you want me socialized up with my grade metrics,
but isn't that what sideband's for? I can socialize real good at home."
Mom does something unexpected: She kneels, putting herself on eye-level with Amber. They're on the living room carpet, all
seventies-retro brown corduroy and acid-orange Paisley wallpaper, and for once, they're alone: The domestic robots are in
hiding while the humans hold court. "Listen to me, sweetie." Mom's voice is breathy, laden with an emotional undertow as
strong and stifling as the eau-de-Cologne she wears to the office to cover up the scent of her client's fear. "I know that's what
your father's writing to you, but it isn't true. You need the company – physical company – of children your own age. You're
natural, not some kind of engineered freak, even with your skullset. Natural children like you need company or they grow up
all weird. Socialization isn't just about texting your own kind, Amber, you need to know how to deal with people who're
different, too. I want you to grow up happy, and that won't happen if you don't learn to get on with children your own age.
You're not going to be some kind of cyborg otaku freak, Amber. But to get healthy, you've got to go to school, build up a
mental immune system. Anyway, that which does not destroy us makes us stronger, right?"
It's crude moral blackmail, transparent as glass and manipulative as hell, but Amber's corpus logica flags it with a heavy
emotional sprite miming the likelihood of physical discipline if she rises to the bait: Mom is agitated, nostrils slightly flared,
ventilation rate up, some vasodilatation visible in her cheeks. Amber – in combination with her skullset and the metacortex
of distributed agents it supports – is mature enough at eight years to model, anticipate, and avoid corporal punishment. But
her stature and lack of physical maturity conspire to put her at a disadvantage when negotiating with adults who matured in
a simpler age. She sighs, then puts on a pout to let Mom know she's still reluctant, but obedient. "O-kay. If you say so."
Mom stands up, eyes distant – probably telling Saturn to warm his engine and open the garage doors. "I say so, punkin. Go
get your shoes on, now. I'll pick you up on my way back from work, and I've got a treat for you; we're going to check out a
new church together this evening." Mom smiles, but it doesn't reach her eyes: Amber has already figured out she's going
through the motions in order to give her the simulated middle-American upbringing she believes Amber desperately needs
before she runs head first into the future. She doesn't like the churches any more than her daughter does, but arguing
won't work. "You be a good little girl, now, all right?"

The imam is at prayer in a gyrostabilized mosque.
His mosque is not very big, and it has a congregation of one: He prays on his own every seventeen thousand two hundred
and eighty seconds. He also webcasts the call to prayer, but there are no other believers in trans-Jovian space to answer the
summons. Between prayers, he splits his attention between the exigencies of life support and scholarship. A student both of
the Hadith and of knowledge-based systems, Sadeq collaborates in a project with other scholars who are building a revised
concordance of all the known isnads, to provide a basis for exploring the body of Islamic jurisprudence from a new
perspective – one they'll need sorely if the looked-for breakthroughs in communication with aliens emerge. Their goal is to
answer the vexatious questions that bedevil Islam in the age of accelerated consciousness; and as their representative in orbit
around Jupiter, these questions fall most heavily on Sadeq's shoulders.
Sadeq is a slightly built man, with close-cropped black hair and a perpetually tired expression: Unlike the orphanage crew he
has a ship to himself. The ship started out as an Iranian knock off of a Shenzhou-B capsule, with a Chinese type 921
space-station module tacked onto its tail; but the clunky, 1960s look-alike – a glittering aluminum dragonfly mating with a
Coke can – has a weirdly contoured M2P2 pod strapped to its nose. The M2P2 pod is a plasma sail, built in orbit by one of
Daewoo's wake shield facilities. It dragged Sadeq and his cramped space station out to Jupiter in just four months, surfing on
the solar breeze. His presence may be a triumph for the umma, but he feels acutely alone out here: When he turns his
compact observatory's mirrors in the direction of the Sanger, he is struck by its size and purposeful appearance. Sanger's
superior size speaks of the efficiency of the Western financial instruments, semiautonomous investment trusts with variable
business-cycle accounting protocols that make possible the development of commercial space exploration. The Prophet,
peace be unto him, may have condemned usury; but it might well have given him pause to see these engines of capital
formation demonstrate their power above the Great Red Spot.
After finishing his prayers, Sadeq spends a couple of precious extra minutes on his mat. He finds meditation comes hard in
this environment: Kneel in silence, and you become aware of the hum of ventilation fans, the smell of old socks and sweat,
the metallic taste of ozone from the Elektron oxygen generators. It is hard to approach God in this third hand spaceship, a
hand-me-down from arrogant Russia to ambitious China, and finally to the religious trustees of Qom, who have better uses
for it than any of the heathen states imagine. They've pushed it far, this little toy space station; but who's to say if it is God's
intention for humans to live here, in orbit around this swollen alien giant of a planet?
Sadeq shakes his head; he rolls his mat up and stows it beside the solitary porthole with a quiet sigh. A stab of homesickness

wrenches at him, for his childhood in hot, dusty Yazd and his many years as a student in Qom: He steadies himself by
looking round, searching the station that is now as familiar to him as the fourth-floor concrete apartment his parents – a car
factory worker and his wife – raised him in. The interior of the station is the size of a school bus, every surface cluttered
with storage areas, instrument consoles, and layers of exposed pipes. A couple of globules of antifreeze jiggle like stranded
jellyfish near a heat exchanger that has been giving him grief. Sadeq kicks off in search of the squeeze bottle he keeps for this
purpose, then gathers up his roll of tools and instructs one of his agents to find him the relevant part of the maintenance
log: it's time to fix the leaky joint for good.
An hour or so of serious plumbing and he will eat freeze-dried lamb stew, with a paste of lentils and boiled rice, and a bulb
of strong tea to wash it down, then sit down to review his next fly-by maneuvering sequence. Perhaps, God willing, there will
be no further system alerts and he'll be able to spend an hour or two on his research between evening and final prayers.
Maybe the day after tomorrow there'll even be time to relax for a couple of hours, to watch one of the old movies that he
finds so fascinating for their insights into alien cultures: Apollo Thirteen, perhaps. It isn't easy, being the crew aboard a
long-duration space mission. It's even harder for Sadeq, up here alone with nobody to talk to, for the communications lag to
earth is more than half an hour each way – and as far as he knows, he's the only believer within half a billion kilometers.

Amber dials a number in Paris and waits until someone answers the phone. She knows the strange woman on the phone's
tiny screen: Mom calls her "your father's fancy bitch" with a peculiar tight smile. (The one time Amber asked what a fancy
bitch was, Mom slapped her – not hard, just a warning.) "Is Daddy there?" she asks.
The strange woman looks slightly bemused. (Her hair is blonde, like Mom's, but the color clearly came out of a bleach bottle,
and it's cut really short, and her skin is dark.) "Oui. Ah, yes." She smiles tentatively. "I am sorry, it is a disposable phone you
are using? You want to talk to 'im?"
It comes out in a rush: "I want to see him." Amber clutches the phone like a lifesaver: It's a cheap disposable cereal-packet
item, and the cardboard is already softening in her sweaty grip. "Momma won't let me, Auntie 'Nette –"
"Hush." Annette, who has lived with Amber's father for more than twice as long as her mother, smiles. "You are sure that
telephone, your mother does not know of it?"
Amber looks around. She's the only child in the restroom because it isn't break time, and she told teacher she had to go
'right now': "I'm sure, P20 confidence factor greater than 0.9." Her Bayesian head tells her that she can't reason accurately
about this because Momma has never caught her with an illicit phone before, but what the hell. It can't get Dad into trouble if
he doesn't know, can it?
"Very good." Annette glances aside. "Manny, I have a surprise call for you."
Daddy appears on screen. She can see all of his face, and he looks younger than last time: he must have stopped using those
clunky old glasses. "Hi – Amber! Where are you? Does your mother know you're calling me?" He looks slightly worried.
"No," she says confidently, "the phone came in a box of Grahams."
"Phew. Listen, sweet, you must remember never, ever to call me where your mom may find out. Otherwise, she'll get her
lawyers to come after me with thumbscrews and hot pincers, because she'll say I made you call me. And not even Uncle
Gianni will be able to sort that out. Understand?"
"Yes, Daddy." She sighs. "Even though that's not true, I know. Don't you want to know why I called?"
"Um." For a moment, he looks taken aback. Then he nods, thoughtfully. Amber likes Daddy because he takes her seriously
most times when she talks to him. It's a phreaking nuisance having to borrow her classmate's phones or tunnel past Mom's
pit-bull firewall, but Dad doesn't assume that she can't know anything just because she's only a kid. "Go ahead. There's
something you need to get off your chest? How've things been, anyway?"
She's going to have to be brief: The disposaphone comes prepaid, the international tariff it's using is lousy, and the break bell
is going to ring any minute. "I want out, Daddy. I mean it. Mom's getting loopier every week – she's dragging me round all
these churches now, and yesterday, she threw a fit over me talking to my terminal. She wants me to see the school shrink, I
mean, what for? I can't do what she wants – I'm not her little girl! Every time I tunnel out, she tries to put a content-bot on
me, and it's making my head hurt – I can't even think straight anymore!" To her surprise, Amber feels tears starting. "Get me
out of here!"
The view of her father shakes, pans round to show her Tante Annette looking worried. "You know, your father, he cannot
do anything? The divorce lawyers, they will tie him up."
Amber sniffs. "Can you help?" she asks.
"I'll see what I can do," her father's fancy bitch promises as the break bell rings.

An instrument package peels away from the Sanger's claim jumper drone and drops toward the potato-shaped rock, fifty
kilometers below. Jupiter hangs huge and gibbous in the background, impressionist wallpaper for a mad cosmologist: Pierre

bites his lower lip as he concentrates on steering it.
Amber, wearing a black sleeping sack, hovers over his head like a giant bat, enjoying her freedom for a shift. She looks down
on Pierre's bowl-cut hair, wiry arms gripping either side of the viewing table, and wonders what to have him do next. A
slave for a day is an interesting experience: Life aboard the Sanger is busy enough that nobody gets much slack time (at least
not until the big habitats have been assembled and the high-bandwidth dish is pointing back at Earth). They're unrolling
everything to a hugely intricate plan generated by the backers' critical path team, and there isn't much room for idling: The
expedition relies on shamelessly exploiting child labor – they're lighter on the life-support consumables than adults –
working the kids twelve hour days to assemble a toe hold on the shore of the future. (When they're older and their options
vest fully, they'll all be rich, but that hasn't stopped the outraged herdnews propaganda chorus from sounding off back
home.) For Amber, the chance to let somebody else work for her is novel, and she's trying to make every minute count.
"Hey, slave," she calls idly; "how you doing?"
Pierre sniffs. "It's going okay." He refuses to glance up at her, Amber notices. He's thirteen. Isn't he supposed to be obsessed
with girls by that age? She notices his quiet, intense focus, runs a stealthy probe along his outer boundary; he shows no sign
of noticing it, but it bounces off, unable to chink his mental armor. "Got cruise speed," he says, taciturn, as two tonnes of
metal, ceramics and diamond-phase weirdness hurtle toward the surface of Barney at three hundred kilometers per hour.
"Stop shoving me, there's a three-second lag, and I don't want to get into a feedback control loop with it."
"I'll shove if I want, slave." She sticks her tongue out at him.
"And if you make me drop it?" he asks. Looking up at her, his face serious – "Are we supposed to be doing this?"
"You cover your ass, and I'll cover mine," she says, then turns bright red. "You know what I mean."
"I do, do I?" Pierre grins widely, then turns back to the console: "Aww, that's no fun. And you want to tune whatever
bit-bucket you've given control of your speech centers to – they're putting out way too much double entendre, somebody
might mistake you for a grown-up."
"You stick to your business, and I'll stick to mine," she says, emphatically. "And you can start by telling me what's happening."
"Nothing." He leans back and crosses his arms, grimacing at the screen. "It's going to drift for five hundred seconds, now,
then there's the midcourse correction and a deceleration burn before touch down. And then it's going to be an hour while
it unwraps itself and starts unwinding the cable spool. What do you want, minute noodles with that?"
"Uh-huh." Amber spreads her bat wings and lies back in mid air, staring at the window, feeling rich and idle as Pierre works
his way through her day shift. "Wake me when there's something interesting to see." Maybe she should have had him feed
her peeled grapes or give her a foot massage, something more traditionally hedonistic; but right now, just knowing he's her
own little piece of alienated labor is doing good things for her self-esteem. Looking at those tense arms, the curve of his neck,
she thinks maybe there's something to this whispering and giggling he really fancies you stuff the older girls go in for –
The window rings like a gong, and Pierre coughs. "You've got mail," he says drily. "You want me to read it for you?"
"What the –" A message is flooding across the screen, right-to-left snaky script like the stuff on her corporate instrument
(now lodged safely in a deposit box in Zurich). It takes her a while to load in a grammar agent that can handle Arabic, and
another minute for her to take in the meaning of the message. When she does, she starts swearing, loudly and continuously.
"You bitch, Mom, why'd you have to go and do a thing like that?"
***
The corporate instrument arrived in a huge FedEx box addressed to Amber: It happened on her birthday while Mom was at
work, and she remembers it as if it was only an hour ago.
She remembers reaching up and scraping her thumb over the deliveryman's clipboard, the rough feel of the
microsequencers sampling her DNA. She drags the package inside. When she pulls the tab on the box, it unpacks itself
automatically, regurgitating a compact 3D printer, half a ream of paper printed in old-fashioned dumb ink, and a small calico
cat with a large @-symbol on its flank. The cat hops out of the box, stretches, shakes its head, and glares at her. "You're
Amber?" it mrowls. It actually makes real cat noises, but the meaning is clear – it's able to talk directly to her linguistic
competence interface.
"Yeah," she says, shyly. "Are you from Tante 'Nette?"
"No, I'm from the fucking tooth fairy." It leans over and head-butts her knee, strops the scent glands between its ears all over
her skirt. "Listen, you got any tuna in the kitchen?"
"Mom doesn't believe in seafood," says Amber. "It's all foreign-farmed muck these days, she says. It's my birthday today, did I
tell you?"
"Happy fucking birthday, then." The cat yawns, convincingly realistic. "Here's your dad's present. Bastard put me in
hibernation and sent me along to show you how to work it. You take my advice, you'll trash the fucker. No good will come
of it."

Amber interrupts the cat's grumbling by clapping her hands gleefully; "So what is it?" she demands: "A new invention? Some
kind of weird sex toy from Amsterdam? A gun, so I can shoot Pastor Wallace?"
"Naah." The cat yawns, yet again, and curls up on the floor next to the 3D printer. "It's some kinda dodgy business model to
get you out of hock to your mom. Better be careful, though – he says its legality is narrowly scoped jurisdiction-wise. Your
Mom might be able to undermine it if she learns about how it works."
"Wow. Like, how totally cool." In truth, Amber is delighted because it is her birthday; but Mom's at work, and Amber's home
alone, with just the TV in moral majority mode for company. Things have gone downhill since Mom decided a modal average
dose of old-time religion was an essential part of her upbringing, to the point that absolutely the best thing in the world
Tante Annette could send her is some scam programmed by Daddy to take her away. If it doesn't work, Mom will take her
to Church tonight, and she's certain she'll end up making a scene again. Amber's tolerance of willful idiocy is diminishing
rapidly, and while building up her memetic immunity might be the real reason Mom's forcing this shit on her – it's always
hard to tell with Mom – things have been tense ever since she got expelled from Sunday school for mounting a spirited
defense of the theory of evolution.
The cat sniffs in the direction of the printer. "Why doncha fire it up?" Amber opens the lid on the printer, removes the
packing popcorn, and plugs it in. There's a whir and a rush of waste heat from its rear as it cools the imaging heads down to
working temperature and registers her ownership.
"What do I do now?" she asks.
"Pick up the page labeled READ ME and follow the instructions," the cat recites in a bored singsong voice. It winks at her,
then fakes an exaggerated French accent: "Le READ ME, il sont contain directions pour executing le corporate instrument
dans le boit. In event of perplexity, consult the accompanying Aineko for clarification." The cat wrinkles its nose rapidly, as if
it's about to bite an invisible insect: "Warning: Don't rely on your father's cat's opinions, it is a perverse beast and cannot be
trusted. Your mother helped seed its meme base, back when they were married. Ends." It mumbles on for a while: "Fucking
snotty Parisian bitch, I'll piss in her knicker drawer, I'll molt in her bidet ..."
"Don't be vile." Amber scans the README quickly. Corporate instruments are strong magic, according to Daddy, and this
one is exotic by any standards – a limited company established in Yemen, contorted by the intersection between shari'a and
the global legislatosaurus. Understanding it isn't easy, even with a personal net full of subsapient agents that have full access to
whole libraries of international trade law – the bottleneck is comprehension. Amber finds the documents highly puzzling. It's
not the fact that half of them are written in Arabic that bothers her – that's what her grammar engine is for – or even that
they're full of S-expressions and semidigestible chunks of LISP: But the company seems to assert that it exists for the sole
purpose of owning chattel slaves.
"What's going on?" she asks the cat. "What's this all about?"
The cat sneezes, then looks disgusted. "This wasn't my idea, big shot. Your father is a very weird guy, and your mother hates
him lots because she's still in love with him. She's got kinks, y'know? Or maybe she's sublimating them, if she's serious about
this church shit she's putting you through. He thinks she's a control freak, and he's not entirely wrong. Anyway, after your
dad ran off in search of another dom, she took out an injunction against him. But she forgot to cover his partner, and she
bought this parcel of worms and sent them to you, okay? Annie is a real bitch, but he's got her wrapped right around his
finger, or something. Anyway, he built these companies and this printer – which isn't hardwired to a filtering proxy, like
your mom's – specifically to let you get away from her legally. If that's what you want to do."
Amber fast-forwards through the dynamic chunks of the README – boring legal UML diagrams, mostly – soaking up the gist
of the plan. Yemen is one of the few countries to implement traditional Sunni shari'a law and a limited liability company scam
at the same time. Owning slaves is legal – the fiction is that the owner has an option hedged on the indentured laborer's
future output, with interest payments that grow faster than the unfortunate victim can pay them off – and companies are
legal entities. If Amber sells herself into slavery to this company, she will become a slave and the company will be legally liable
for her actions and upkeep. The rest of the legal instrument – about ninety percent of it, in fact – is a set of self-modifying
corporate mechanisms coded in a variety of jurisdictions that permit Turing-complete company constitutions, and which act
as an ownership shell for the slavery contract. At the far end of the corporate shell game is a trust fund of which Amber is
the prime beneficiary and shareholder. When she reaches the age of majority, she'll acquire total control over all the
companies in the network and can dissolve her slave contract; until then, the trust fund (which she essentially owns) oversees
the company that owns her (and keeps it safe from hostile takeover bids). Oh, and the company network is primed by an
extraordinary general meeting that instructed it to move the trust's assets to Paris immediately. A one-way airline ticket is
enclosed.
"You think I should take this?" she asks uncertainly. It's hard to tell how smart the cat really is – there's probably a yawning
vacuum behind those semantic networks if you dig deep enough – but it tells a pretty convincing tale.
The cat squats and curls its tail protectively around its paws: "I'm saying nothing, you know what I mean? You take this, you
can go live with your dad. But it won't stop your ma coming after him with a horsewhip, and after you with a bunch of
lawyers and a set of handcuffs. You want my advice, you'll phone the Franklins and get aboard their off-planet mining scam.
In space, no one can serve a writ on you. Plus, they got long-term plans to get into the CETI market, cracking alien network
packets. You want my honest opinion, you wouldn't like it in Paris after a bit. Your Dad and the frog bitch, they're swingers,
y'know? No time in their lives for a kid. Or a cat like me, now I think of it. They're working all day for the Senator, and out
all hours of night doing drugs, fetish parties, raves, opera, that kind of adult shit. Your Dad dresses in frocks more than your
mom, and your Tante 'Nettie leads him around the apartment on a chain when they're not having noisy sex on the balcony.

They'd cramp your style, kid. You shouldn't have to put up with parents who have more of a life than you do."
"Huh." Amber wrinkles her nose, half-disgusted by the cat's transparent scheming, and half-acknowledging its message: I better
think hard about this, she decides. Then she flies off in so many directions at once that she nearly browns out the household
broadband. Part of her is examining the intricate card pyramid of company structures; somewhere else, she's thinking about
what can go wrong, while another bit (probably some of her wet, messy glandular biological self) is thinking about how nice
it would be to see Daddy again, albeit with some trepidation. Parents aren't supposed to have sex – isn't there a law, or
something? "Tell me about the Franklins? Are they married? Singular?"
The 3D printer is cranking up. It hisses slightly, dissipating heat from the hard vacuum chamber in its supercooled
workspace. Deep in its guts it creates coherent atom beams, from a bunch of Bose–Einstein condensates hovering on the
edge of absolute zero. By superimposing interference patterns on them, it generates an atomic hologram, building a perfect
replica of some original artifact, right down to the atomic level – there are no clunky moving nanotechnology parts to break
or overheat or mutate. Something is going to come out of the printer in half an hour, something cloned off its original right
down to the individual quantum states of its component atomic nuclei. The cat, seemingly oblivious, shuffles closer to the
warm air exhaust ducts.
"Bob Franklin, he died about two, three years before you were born – your dad did business with him. So did your mom.
Anyway, he had chunks of his noumen preserved and the estate trustees are trying to re-create his consciousness by
cross-loading him in their implants. They're sort of a borganism, but with money and style. Anyway, Bob got into the space
biz back then, with some financial wizardry a friend of your father whipped up for him, and now they're building a spacehab
that they're going to take all the way out to Jupiter, where they can dismantle a couple of small moons and begin building
helium-three refineries. It's that CETI scam I told you about earlier, but they've got a whole load of other angles on it for the
long term. See, your dad's friends have cracked the broadcast, the one everybody knows about. It's a bunch of instructions
for finding the nearest router that plugs into the galactic Internet. And they want to go out there and talk to some aliens."
This is mostly going right over Amber's head – she'll have to learn what helium-three refineries are later – but the idea of
running away to space has a certain appeal. Adventure, that's what. Amber looks around the living room and sees it for a
moment as a capsule, a small wooden cell locked deep in a vision of a middle America that never was – the one her mom
wants to bring her up in, like a misshapen Skinner box designed to train her to be normal. "Is Jupiter fun?" she asks. "I know
it's big and not very dense, but is it, like, a happening place? Are there any aliens there?"
"It's the first place you need to go if you want to get to meet the aliens eventually," says the cat as the printer clanks and
disgorges a fake passport (convincingly aged), an intricate metal seal engraved with Arabic script, and a tailored
wide-spectrum vaccine targeted on Amber's immature immune system. "Stick that on your wrist, sign the three top copies,
put them in the envelope, and let's get going. We've got a flight to catch, slave."
***
Sadeq is eating his dinner when the first lawsuit in Jupiter orbit rolls in.
Alone in the cramped humming void of his station, he considers the plea. The language is awkward, showing all the hallmarks
of a crude machine translation: The supplicant is American, a woman, and – oddly – claims to be a Christian. This is
surprising enough, but the nature of her claim is, at face value, preposterous. He forces himself to finish his bread, then bag
the waste and clean the platter, before he gives it his full consideration. Is it a tasteless joke? Evidently not. As the only quadi
outside the orbit of Mars, he is uniquely qualified to hear it, and it is a case that cries out for justice.
A woman who leads a God-fearing life – not a correct one, no, but she shows some signs of humility and progress toward a
deeper understanding – is deprived of her child by the machinations of a feckless husband who deserted her years before.
That the woman was raising the child alone strikes Sadeq as disturbingly Western, but pardonable when he reads her
account of the feckless one's behavior, which is pretty lax; an ill fate indeed would await any child that this man raises to
adulthood. This man deprives her of her child, but not by legitimate means: He doesn't take the child into his own
household or make any attempt to raise her, either in accordance with his own customs or the precepts of shari'a. Instead,
he enslaves her wickedly in the mire of the Western legal tradition, then casts her into outer darkness to be used as a
laborer by the dubious forces of self-proclaimed "progress". The same forces Sadeq has been sent to confront, as
representative of the umma in orbit around Jupiter.
Sadeq scratches his short beard thoughtfully. A nasty tale, but what can he do about it? "Computer," he says, "a reply to this
supplicant: My sympathies lie with you in the manner of your suffering, but I fail to see in what way I can be of assistance.
Your heart cries out for help before God (blessed be his name), but surely this is a matter for the temporal authorities of
the dar al-Harb." He pauses: Or is it? he wonders. Legal wheels begin to turn in his mind. "If you can but find your way to
extending to me a path by which I can assert the primacy of shari'a over your daughter, I shall apply myself to constructing
a case for her emancipation, to the greater glory of God (blessed be his name). Ends, sigblock, send."
Releasing the Velcro straps that hold him at the table, Sadeq floats up and kicks gently toward the forward end of the
cramped habitat. The controls of the telescope are positioned between the ultrasonic clothing cleaner and the lithium
hydroxide scrubbers. They're already freed up, because he was conducting a wide-field survey of the inner ring, looking for
the signature of water ice. It is the work of a few moments to pipe the navigation and tracking system into the telescope's
controller and direct it to hunt for the big foreign ship of fools. Something nudges at Sadeq's mind urgently, an irritating
realization that he may have missed something in the woman's e-mail: there were a number of huge attachments. With half
his mind he surfs the news digest his scholarly peers send him daily. Meanwhile, he waits patiently for the telescope to find
the speck of light that the poor woman's daughter is enslaved within.

This might be a way in, he realizes, a way to enter dialogue with them. Let the hard questions answer themselves, elegantly.
There will be no need for confrontation if they can be convinced that their plans are faulty: no need to defend the godly
from the latter-day Tower of Babel these people propose to build. If this woman Pamela means what she says, Sadeq need
not end his days out here in the cold between the worlds, away from his elderly parents and brother, and his colleagues and
friends. And he will be profoundly grateful, because in his heart of hearts, he knows that he is less a warrior than a scholar.

"I'm sorry, but the borg is attempting to assimilate a lawsuit," says the receptionist. "Will you hold?"
"Crud." Amber blinks the Binary Betty answerphone sprite out of her eye and glances round at the cabin. "That is so last
century," she grumbles. "Who do they think they are?"
"Dr. Robert H. Franklin," volunteers the cat. "It's a losing proposition if you ask me. Bob was so fond of his dope there's this
whole hippy group mind that's grown up using his state vector as a bong –"
"Shut the fuck up!" Amber shouts at him. Instantly contrite (for yelling in an inflatable spacecraft is a major faux pas): "Sorry."
She spawns an autonomic thread with full parasympathetic nervous control, tells it to calm her down, then spawns a couple
more to go forth and become fuqaha, expert on shari'a law. She realizes she's buying up way too much of the orphanage's
scarce bandwidth – time that will have to be paid for in chores, later – but it's necessary. "Mom's gone too far. This time it's
war."
She slams out of her cabin and spins right round in the central axis of the hab, a rogue missile pinging for a target to vent
her rage on. A tantrum would be good –
But her body is telling her to chill out, take ten, and there's a drone of scriptural lore dribbling away in the back of her
head, and she's feeling frustrated and angry and not in control, but not really mad anymore. It was like this three years ago
when Mom noticed her getting on too well with Jenny Morgan and moved her to a new school district – she said it was a
work assignment, but Amber knows better, Mom asked for it – just to keep her dependent and helpless. Mom is a
control-freak with fixed ideas about how to bring up a child, and ever since she lost Dad, she's been working her claws into
Amber, making her upbringing a life's work – which is tough, because Amber is not good victim material, and is smart and
well networked to boot. But now, Mom's found a way to fuck Amber over completely, even in Jupiter orbit, and if not for
her skullware keeping a lid on things, Amber would be totally out of control.
Instead of shouting at her cat or trying to message the Franklins, Amber goes to hunt down the borg in their meatspace den.
There are sixteen borg aboard the Sanger – adults, members of the Franklin Collective, squatters in the ruins of Bob
Franklin's posthumous vision. They lend bits of their brains to the task of running what science has been able to resurrect of
the dead dot-com billionaire's mind, making him the first bodhisattva of the uploading age – apart from the lobster colony,
of course. Their den mother is a woman called Monica: a willowy, brown-eyed hive queen with raster-burned corneal
implants and a dry, sardonic delivery that can corrode egos like a desert wind. She's better than any of the others at
running Bob, except for the creepy one called Jack, and she's no slouch when she's being herself (unlike Jack, who is never
himself in public). Which probably explains why they elected her Maximum Leader of the expedition.
Amber finds Monica in the number four kitchen garden, performing surgery on a filter that's been blocked by toad spawn.
She's almost buried beneath a large pipe, her Velcro-taped tool kit waving in the breeze like strange blue air-kelp. "Monica?
You got a minute?"
"Sure, I have lots of minutes. Make yourself helpful? Pass me the antitorque wrench and a number six hex head."
"Um." Amber captures the blue flag and fiddles around with its contents. Something that has batteries, motors, a flywheel
counterweight, and laser gyros assembles itself – Amber passes it under the pipe. "Here. Listen, your phone is engaged."
"I know. You've come to see me about your conversion, haven't you?"
"Yes!"
There's a clanking noise from under the pressure sump. "Take this." A plastic bag floats out, bulging with stray fasteners. "I
got a bit of hoovering to do. Get yourself a mask if you don't already have one."
A minute later, Amber is back beside Monica's legs, her face veiled by a filter mask. "I don't want this to go through," she
says. "I don't care what Mom says, I'm not Moslem! This judge, he can't touch me. He can't," she adds, vehemence warring
with uncertainty.
"Maybe he doesn't want to?" Another bag: "Here, catch."
Amber grabs the bag, a fraction of a second too late. She discovers the hard way that it's full of water and toadspawn.
Stringy mucous ropes full of squiggling comma-shaped tadpoles explode all over the compartment and bounce off the walls
in a shower of amphibian confetti. "Eew!"
Monica squirms out from behind the pipe. "Oh, you didn't." She kicks off the consensus-defined floor and grabs a wad of
absorbent paper from the spinner, whacks it across the ventilator shroud above the sump. Together they go after the toad
spawn with rubbish bags and paper – by the time they've got the stringy mess mopped up, the spinner has begun to click

and whir, processing cellulose from the algae tanks into fresh wipes. "That was not good," Monica says emphatically as the
disposal bin sucks down her final bag. "You wouldn't happen to know how the toad got in here?"
"No, but I ran into one that was loose in the commons, one shift before last cycle-end. Gave it a ride back to Oscar."
"I'll have a word with him, then." Monica glares blackly at the pipe. "I'm going to have to go back and refit the filter in a
minute. Do you want me to be Bob?"
"Uh." Amber thinks. "Not sure. Your call."
"All right, Bob coming on-line." Monica's face relaxes slightly, then her expression hardens. "Way I see it, you've got a choice.
Your mother kinda boxed you in, hasn't she?"
"Yes." Amber frowns.
"So. Pretend I'm an idiot. Talk me through it, huh?"
Amber drags herself alongside the hydro pipe and gets her head down, alongside Monica/Bob, who is floating with her feet
near the floor. "I ran away from home. Mom owned me – that is, she had parental rights and Dad had none. So Dad, via a
proxy, helped me sell myself into slavery to a company. The company was owned by a trust fund, and I'm the main
beneficiary when I reach the age of majority. As a chattel, the company tells me what to do – legally – but the shell company
is set to take my orders. So I'm autonomous. Right?"
"That sounds like the sort of thing your father would do," Monica/Bob says neutrally. Overtaken by a sardonic middle-aged
Silicon Valley drawl, her north-of-England accent sounds peculiarly mid-Atlantic.
"Trouble is, most countries don't acknowledge slavery, they just dress it up pretty and call it in loco parentis or something.
Those that do mostly don't have any equivalent of a limited liability company, much less one that can be directed by another
company from abroad. Dad picked Yemen on the grounds that they've got this stupid brand of shari'a law – and a crap
human rights record – but they're just about conformant to the open legal standards protocol, able to interface to EU
norms via a Turkish legislative cut-out."
"So."
"Well, I guess I was technically a Janissary. Mom was doing her Christian phase, so that made me a Christian unbeliever slave
of an Islamic company. Now the stupid bitch has gone and converted to shi'ism. Normally Islamic descent runs through the
father, but she picked her sect carefully and chose one that's got a progressive view of women's rights: They're sort of Islamic
fundamentalist liberal constructionists, 'what would the Prophet do if he was alive today and had to worry about
self-replicating chewing gum factories' and that sort of thing. They generally take a progressive view of things like legal equality
of the sexes because, for his time and place, the Prophet was way ahead of the ball and they figure they ought to follow his
example. Anyway, that means Mom can assert that I am Moslem, and under Yemeni law, I get to be treated as a Moslem
chattel of a company. And their legal code is very dubious about permitting slavery of Moslems. It's not that I have rights as
such, but my pastoral well-being becomes the responsibility of the local imam, and –" She shrugs helplessly.
"Has he tried to make you run under any new rules, yet?" asks Monica/Bob. "Has he put blocks on your freedom of agency,
tried to mess with your mind? Insisted on libido dampers or a strict dress code?"
"Not yet." Amber's expression is grim. "But he's no dummy. I figure he may be using Mom – and me – as a way of getting his
fingers into this whole expedition. Staking a claim for jurisdiction, claim arbitration, that sort of thing. It could be worse; he
might order me to comply fully with his specific implementation of shari'a. They permit implants, but require mandatory
conceptual filtering: If I run that stuff, I'll end up believing it."
"Okay." Monica does a slow backward somersault in midair. "Now tell me why you can't simply repudiate it."
"Because." Deep breath. "I can do that in two ways. I can deny Islam, which makes me an apostate, and automatically
terminates my indenture to the shell, so Mom owns me under US or EU law. Or I can say that the instrument has no legal
standing because I was in the USA when I signed it, and slavery is illegal there, in which case Mom owns me. Or I can take the
veil, live like a modest Moslem woman, do whatever the imam wants, and Mom doesn't own me – but she gets to appoint my
chaperone. Oh Bob, she has planned this so well."
"Uh-huh." Monica rotates back to the floor and looks at Amber, suddenly very Bob. "Now you've told me your troubles,
start thinking like your dad. Your Dad had a dozen creative ideas before breakfast every day – it's how he made his name.
Your mom has got you in a box. Think your way outside it: What can you do?"
"Well." Amber rolls over and hugs the fat hydroponic duct to her chest like a life raft. "It's a legal paradox. I'm trapped
because of the jurisdiction she's cornered me in. I could talk to the judge, I suppose, but she'll have picked him carefully."
Her eyes narrow. "The jurisdiction. Hey, Bob." She lets go of the duct and floats free, hair streaming out behind her like a
cometary halo. "How do I go about getting myself a new jurisdiction?"
Monica grins. "I seem to recall the traditional way was to grab yourself some land and set yourself up as king; but there are
other ways. I've got some friends I think you should meet. They're not good conversationalists and there's a two-hour
lightspeed delay, but I think you'll find they've answered that question already. But why don't you talk to the imam first and

find out what he's like? He may surprise you. After all, he was already out here before your mom decided to use him to

The Sanger hangs in orbit thirty kilometers up, circling the waist of potato-shaped Amalthea. Drones swarm across the slopes
of Mons Lyctos, ten kilometers above the mean surface level. They kick up clouds of reddish sulphate dust as they spread
transparent sheets across the barren moonscape. This close to Jupiter (a mere hundred and eighty thousand kilometers
above the swirling madness of the cloudscape) the gas giant fills half the sky with a perpetually changing clock face, for
Amalthea orbits the master in just under twelve hours. The Sanger's radiation shields are running at full power, shrouding
the ship in a corona of rippling plasma: Radio is useless, and the human miners control their drones via an intricate network
of laser circuits. Other, larger drones are unwinding spools of heavy electrical cable north and south from the landing site.
Once the circuits are connected, they will form a coil cutting through Jupiter's magnetic field, generating electrical current
(and imperceptibly sapping the moon's orbital momentum).
Amber sighs and looks, for the sixth time this hour, at the webcam plastered on the side of her cabin. She's taken down the
posters and told the toys to tidy themselves away. In another two thousand seconds, the tiny Iranian spaceship will rise above
the limb of Moshtari, and then it will be time to talk to the teacher. She isn't looking forward to the experience. If he's a
grizzled old blockhead of the most obdurate fundamentalist streak, she'll be in trouble: Disrespect for age has been part and
parcel of the Western teenage experience for generations, and a cross-cultural thread that she's detailed to clue up on Islam
reminds her that not all cultures share this outlook. But if he turns out to be young, intelligent, and flexible, things could be
even worse. When she was eight, Amber audited The Taming of the Shrew. She finds she has no appetite for a starring role
in her own cross-cultural production.
She sighs again. "Pierre?"
"Yeah?" His voice comes from the foot of the emergency locker in her room. He's curled up down there, limbs twitching
languidly as he drives a mining drone around the surface of Object Barney, as the rock has named itself. The drone is a
long-legged crane fly look-alike, bouncing very slowly from toe tip to toe tip in the microgravity. The rock is only half a
kilometer along its longest axis, coated brown with weird hydrocarbon goop and sulphur compounds sprayed off the surface
of Io by the Jovian winds. "I'm coming."
"You better." She glances at the screen. "One twenty seconds to next burn." The payload canister on the screen is,
technically speaking, stolen. It'll be okay as long as she gives it back, Bob said, although she won't be able to do that until it's
reached Barney and they've found enough water ice to refuel it. "Found anything yet?"
"Just the usual. Got a seam of ice near the semimajor pole – it's dirty, but there's at least a thousand tons there. And the
surface is crunchy with tar. Amber, you know what? The orange shit, it's solid with fullerenes."
Amber grins at her reflection in the screen. That's good news. Once the payload she's steering touches down, Pierre can
help her lay superconducting wires along Barney's long axis. It's only a kilometer and a half, and that'll only give them a few
tens of kilowatts of juice, but the condensation fabricator that's also in the payload can will be able to use it to convert
Barney's crust into processed goods at about two grams per second. Using designs copylefted by the free hardware
foundation, inside two hundred thousand seconds they'll have a grid of sixty-four 3D printers barfing up structured matter
at a rate limited only by available power. Starting with a honking great dome tent and some free nitrogen/oxygen for her to
breathe, then adding a big web cache and direct high-bandwidth uplink to Earth, Amber could have her very own one-girl
colony up and running within a million seconds.
The screen blinks at her. "Oh shit! Make yourself scarce, Pierre?" The incoming call nags at her attention. "Yeah? Who are
you?"
The screen fills with a view of a cramped, very twen-cen-looking space capsule. The guy inside it is in his twenties, with a
heavily tanned face, close-cropped hair and beard, wearing an olive drab space suit liner. He's floating between a TORU
manual docking controller and a gilt-framed photograph of the Ka'bah at Mecca. "Good evening to you," he says solemnly.
"Do I have the honor to be addressing Amber Macx?"
"Uh, yeah? That's me." She stares at him: He looks nothing like her conception of an ayatollah – whatever an ayatollah is –
elderly, black-robed, vindictively fundamentalist. "Who are you?"
"I am Dr. Sadeq Khurasani. I hope that I am not interrupting you? Is it convenient for you that we talk now?"
He looks so anxious that Amber nods automatically. "Sure. Did my Mom put you up to this?" They're still speaking English,
and she notices that his diction is good, but slightly stilted. He isn't using a grammar engine, he actually learned the language
the hard way, she realizes, feeling a frisson of fear. "You want to be careful how you talk to her. She doesn't lie, exactly, but
she gets people to do what she wants."
"Yes, I spoke to – ah." A pause. They're still almost a light-second apart, time for painful collisions and accidental silences. "I
see. Are you sure you should be speaking of your mother that way?"
Amber breathes deeply. "Adults can get divorced. If I could get divorced from her, I would. She's –" She flails around for the
right word helplessly. "Look, she's the sort of person who can't lose a fight. If she's going to lose, she'll try to figure how to
set the law on you. Like she's done to me. Don't you see?"

Dr. Khurasani looks extremely dubious. "I am not sure I understand," He says. "Perhaps, mmm, I should tell you why I am
talking to you?"
"Sure. Go ahead." Amber is startled by his attitude: He actually seems to be taking her seriously, she realizes. Treating her
like an adult. The sensation is so novel – coming from someone more than twenty years old – that she almost lets herself
forget that he's only talking to her because Mom set her up.
"Well, I am an engineer. In addition, I am a student of fiqh, jurisprudence. In fact, I am qualified to sit in judgment. I am a very
junior judge, but even so, it is a heavy responsibility. Anyway, your mother, peace be unto her, lodged a petition with me.
Are you aware of it?"
"Yes." Amber tenses up. "It's a lie. Distortion of the facts."
"Hmm." Sadeq rubs his beard thoughtfully. "Well, I have to find out, yes? Your mother has submitted herself to the will of
God. This makes you the child of a Moslem, and she claims –"
"She's trying to use you as a weapon!" Amber interrupts. "I sold myself into slavery to get away from her, do you
understand? I enslaved myself to a company that is held in trust for my ownership. She's trying to change the rules to get me
back. You know what? I don't believe she gives a shit about your religion, all she wants is me!"
"A mother's love –"
"Fuck love," Amber snarls, "she wants power."
Sadeq's expression hardens. "You have a foul mouth in your head, child. All I am trying to do is to find out the facts of this
situation. You should ask yourself if such disrespect furthers your interests?" He pauses for a moment, then continues, less
abruptly. "Did you really have such a bad childhood with her? Do you think she did everything merely for power, or could
she love you?" Pause. "You must understand, I need to learn these things. Before I can know what is the right thing to do."
"My mother –" Amber stops dead and spawns a vaporous cloud of memory retrievals. They fan out through the space
around her mind like the tail of her cometary mind. Invoking a complex of network parsers and class filters, she turns the
memories into reified images and blats them at the webcam's tiny brain so he can see them. Some of the memories are so
painful that Amber has to close her eyes. Mom in full office war paint, leaning over Amber, promising to disable her lexical
enhancements forcibly if she doesn't work on her grammar without them. Mom telling Amber that they're moving again,
abruptly, dragging her away from school and the friends she'd tentatively started to like. The church-of-the-month business.
Mom catching her on the phone to Daddy, tearing the phone in half and hitting her with it. Mom at the kitchen table,
forcing her to eat – "My mother likes control."
"Ah." Sadeq's expression turns glassy. "And this is how you feel about her? How long have you had that level of – no, please
forgive me for asking. You obviously understand implants. Do your grandparents know? Did you talk to them?"
"My grandparents?" Amber stifles a snort. "Mom's parents are dead. Dad's are still alive, but they won't talk to him – they like
Mom. They think I'm creepy. I know little things, their tax bands and customer profiles. I could mine data with my head
when I was four. I'm not built like little girls were in their day, and they don't understand. You know the old ones don't like
us at all? Some of the churches make money doing nothing but exorcisms for oldsters who think their kids are possessed."
"Well." Sadeq is fingering his beard again, distractedly. "I must say, this is a lot to learn. But you know your mother has
accepted Islam, don't you? This means that you are Moslem, too. Unless you are an adult, your parent legally speaks for you.
And she says this makes you my problem. Hmm."
"I'm not a Muslim." Amber stares at the screen. "I'm not a child, either." Her threads are coming together, whispering scarily
behind her eyes: Her head is suddenly dense and turgid with ideas, heavy as a stone and twice as old as time. "I am nobody's
chattel. What does your law say about people who are born with implants? What does it say about people who want to live
forever? I don't believe in any god, Mr. Judge. I don't believe in limits. Mom can't, physically, make me do anything, and she
sure can't speak for me. All she can do is challenge my legal status, and if I choose to stay where she can't touch me, what
does that matter?"
"Well, if that is what you have to say, I must think on the matter." He catches her eye; his expression is thoughtful, like a
doctor considering a diagnosis. "I will call you again in due course. In the meantime, if you need to talk to anyone, remember
that I am always available. If there is anything I can do to help ease your pain, I would be pleased to be of service. Peace be
unto you, and those you care for."
"Same to you, too," she mutters darkly, as the connection goes dead. "Now what?" she asks, as a beeping sprite gyrates across
the wall, begging for attention.
"I think it's the lander," Pierre says helpfully. "Is it down yet?"
She rounds on him: "Hey, I thought I told you to get lost!"
"What, and miss all the fun?" He grins at her impishly. "Amber's got a new boyfriend! Wait until I tell everybody ..."

Sleep cycles pass; the borrowed 3D printer on Object Barney's surface spews bitmaps of atoms in quantum
lockstep at its rendering platform, building up the control circuitry and skeletons of new printers (There are
no clunky nanoassemblers here, no robots the size of viruses busily sorting molecules into piles – just the
bizarre quantized magic of atomic holography, modulated Bose–Einstein condensates collapsing into strange,
lacy, supercold machinery.) Electricity surges through the cable loops as they slice through Jupiter's
magnetosphere, slowly converting the rock's momentum into power. Small robots grovel in the orange dirt,
scooping up raw material to feed to the fractionating oven. Amber's garden of machinery flourishes slowly,
unpacking itself according to a schema designed by preteens at an industrial school in Poland, with barely
any need for human guidance.
High in orbit around Amalthea, complex financial instruments breed and conjugate. Developed for the
express purpose of facilitating trade with the alien intelligences believed to have been detected eight years
earlier by SETI, they function equally well as fiscal gatekeepers for space colonies. The Sanger's bank accounts
in California and Cuba are looking acceptable – since entering Jupiter space, the orphanage has staked a
claim on roughly a hundred gigatons of random rocks and a moon that's just small enough to creep in
under the International Astronomical Union's definition of a sovereign planetary body. The borg are working
hard, leading their eager teams of child stakeholders in their plans to build the industrial metastructures
necessary to support mining helium-three from Jupiter. They're so focused that they spend much of their
time being themselves, not bothering to run Bob, the shared identity that gives them their messianic drive.
Half a light-hour away, tired Earth wakes and slumbers in time to its ancient orbital dynamics. A religious
college in Cairo is considering issues of nanotechnology: If replicators are used to prepare a copy of a strip of
bacon, right down to the molecular level, but without it ever being part of a pig, how is it to be treated? (If
the mind of one of the faithful is copied into a computing machine's memory by mapping and simulating all
its synapses, is the computer now a Moslem? If not, why not? If so, what are its rights and duties?) Riots in
Borneo underline the urgency of this theotechnological inquiry.
More riots in Barcelona, Madrid, Birmingham, and Marseilles also underline a rising problem: the social chaos
caused by cheap anti-aging treatments. The zombie exterminators, a backlash of disaffected youth against the
formerly graying gerontocracy of Europe, insist that people who predate the supergrid and can't handle
implants aren't really conscious: Their ferocity is equaled only by the anger of the dynamic septuagenarians of
the baby boom, their bodies partially restored to the flush of sixties youth, but their minds adrift in a slower,
less contingent century. The faux-young boomers feel betrayed, forced back into the labor pool, but unable
to cope with the implant-accelerated culture of the new millennium, their hard-earned experience rendered
obsolete by deflationary time.
The Bangladeshi economic miracle is typical of the age. With growth rates running at over twenty percent,
cheap out-of-control bioindustrialization has swept the nation: Former rice farmers harvest plastics and milk
cows for silk, while their children study mariculture and design seawalls. With cellphone ownership nearing
eighty percent and literacy at ninety, the once-poor country is finally breaking out of its historical
infrastructure trap and beginning to develop: In another generation, they'll be richer than Japan.
Radical new economic theories are focusing around bandwidth, speed-of-light transmission time, and the
implications of CETI, communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Cosmologists and quants collaborate
on bizarre relativistically telescoped financial instruments. Space (which lets you store information) and
structure (which lets you process it) acquire value while dumb mass – like gold – loses it. The degenerate
cores of the traditional stock markets are in free fall, the old smokestack microprocessor and
biotech/nanotech industries crumbling before the onslaught of matter replicators and self-modifying ideas.
The inheritors look set to be a new wave of barbarian communicators, who mortgage their future for a
millennium against the chance of a gift from a visiting alien intelligence. Microsoft, once the US Steel of the
silicon age, quietly fades into liquidation.
An outbreak of green goo – a crude biomechanical replicator that eats everything in its path – is dealt with
in the Australian outback by carpet-bombing with fuel-air explosives. The USAF subsequently reactivates two
wings of refurbished B-52s and places them at the disposal of the UN standing committee on self-replicating
weapons. (CNN discovers that one of their newest pilots, re-enlisting with the body of a twenty-year-old and
an empty pension account, first flew them over Laos and Cambodia.) The news overshadows the World
Health Organization's announcement of the end of the HIV pandemic, after more than fifty years of bigotry,
panic, and megadeath.

"Breathe steadily. Remember your regulator drill? If you spot your heart rate going up or your mouth going dry, take five."
"Shut the fuck up, 'Neko, I'm trying to concentrate." Amber fumbles with the titanium D-ring, trying to snake the strap
through it. The gauntlets are getting in her way. High orbit space suits – little more than a body stocking designed to hold
your skin under compression and help you breathe – are easy, but this deep in Jupiter's radiation belt she has to wear an
old Orlan-DM suit that comes in about thirteen layers. The gloves are stiff and hard to work in. It's Chernobyl weather
outside, a sleet of alpha particles and raw protons storming through the void, and she really needs the extra protection.
"Got it." She yanks the strap tight, pulls on the D-ring, then goes to work on the next strap. Never looking down; because
the wall she's tying herself to has no floor, just a cutoff two meters below, then empty space for a hundred kilometers before
the nearest solid ground.

The ground sings to her moronically: "I love you, you love me, it's the law of gravity –"
She shoves her feet down onto the platform that juts from the side of the capsule like a suicide's ledge: metallized Velcro
grabs hold, and she pulls on the straps to turn her body round until she can see past the capsule, sideways. The capsule
masses about five tonnes, barely bigger than an ancient Soyuz. It's packed to overflowing with environment-sensitive stuff
she'll need, and a honking great high-gain antenna. "I hope you know what you're doing," someone says over the intercom.
"Of course I –" She stops. Alone in this Energiya NPO surplus iron maiden with its low-bandwidth coms and bizarre
plumbing, she feels claustrophobic and helpless: Parts of her mind don't work. When she was four, Mom took her down a
famous cave system somewhere out west. When the guide turned out the lights half a kilometer underground, she'd
screamed with surprise as the darkness had reached out and touched her. Now it's not the darkness that frightens her, it's
the lack of thought. For a hundred kilometers below her there are no minds, and even on the surface there's only the
moronic warbling of 'bots for company. Everything that makes the universe primate-friendly seems to be locked in the huge
spaceship that looms somewhere just behind the back of her head, and she has to fight down an urge to shed her straps and
swarm back up the umbilical that anchors the capsule to the Sanger. "I'll be fine," she forces herself to say. And even though
she's unsure that it's true, she tries to make herself believe it. "It's just leaving-home nerves. I've read about it, okay?"
There's a funny, high-pitched whistle in her ears. For a moment, the sweat on the back of her neck turns icy cold, then the
noise stops. She strains for a moment, and when it returns she recognizes the sound: The hitherto-talkative cat, curled in the
warmth of her pressurized luggage can, has begun to snore.
"Let's go," she says, "Time to roll the wagon." A speech macro deep in the Sanger's docking firmware recognizes her authority
and gently lets go of the pod. A couple of cold gas clusters pop, sending deep banging vibrations running through the
capsule, and she's on her way.
"Amber. How's it hanging?" A familiar voice in her ears: She blinks. Fifteen hundred seconds, nearly half an hour gone.
"Robes-Pierre, chopped any aristos lately?"
"Heh!" A pause. "I can see your head from here."
"How's it looking?" she asks. There's a lump in her throat; she isn't sure why. Pierre is probably hooked into one of the
smaller proximity cameras dotted around the outer hull of the big mother ship, watching over her as she falls.
"Pretty much like always," he says laconically. Another pause, this time longer. "This is wild, you know? Su Ang says hi, by the
way."
"Su Ang, hi," she replies, resisting the urge to lean back and look up – up relative to her feet, not her vector – and see if the
ship's still visible.
"Hi," Ang says shyly. "You're very brave?"
"Still can't beat you at chess." Amber frowns. Su Ang and her overengineered algae. Oscar and his pharmaceutical factory
toads. People she's known for three years, mostly ignored, and never thought about missing. "Listen, are you going to come
visiting?"
"You want us to visit?" Ang sounds dubious. "When will it be ready?"
"Oh, soon enough." At four kilograms per minute of structured-matter output, the printers on the surface have already built
her a bunch of stuff: a habitat dome, the guts of an algae/shrimp farm, an excavator to bury it with, an airlock. Even a honey
bucket. It's all lying around waiting for her to put it together and move into her new home. "Once the borg get back from
Amalthea."
"Hey! You mean they're moving? How did you figure that?"
"Go talk to them," Amber says. Actually, she's a large part of the reason the Sanger is about to crank its orbit up and out
toward the other moon: She wants to be alone in coms silence for a couple of million seconds. The Franklin collective is
doing her a big favor.
"Ahead of the curve, as usual," Pierre cuts in, with something that sounds like admiration to her uncertain ears.
"You too," she says, a little too fast: "Come visit when I've got the life-support cycle stabilized."
"I'll do that," he replies. A red glow suffuses the flank of the capsule next to her head, and she looks up in time to see the
glaring blue laser line of the Sanger's drive torch powering up.

Eighteen million seconds, almost a tenth of a Jupiter year, passes.
The imam tugs thoughtfully on his beard as he stares at the traffic control display. These days, every shift seems to bring a
new crewed spaceship into Jupiter system: Space is getting positively crowded. When he arrived, there were fewer than two
hundred people here. Now there's the population of a small city, and many of them live at the heart of the approach map

centered on his display. He breathes deeply – trying to ignore the omnipresent odor of old socks – and studies the map.
"Computer, what about my slot?" he asks.
"Your slot: Cleared to commence final approach in six-nine-five seconds. Speed limit is ten meters per second inside ten
kilometers, drop to two meters per second inside one kilometer. Uploading map of forbidden thrust vectors now." Chunks of
the approach map turn red, gridded off to prevent his exhaust stream damaging other craft in the area.
Sadeq sighs. "We'll go in using Kurs. I assume their Kurs guidance is active?"
"Kurs docking target support available to shell level three."
"Praise Allah." He pokes around through the guidance subsystem's menus, setting up the software emulation of the obsolete
(but highly reliable) Soyuz docking system. At last he can leave the ship to look after itself for a bit. He glances round. For
two years he has lived in this canister, and soon he will step outside it. It hardly seems real.
The radio, usually silent, crackles with unexpected life. "Bravo One One, this is Imperial Traffic Control. Verbal contact
required, over."
Sadeq twitches with surprise. The voice sounds inhuman, paced with the cadences of a speech synthesizer, like so many of
Her Majesty's subjects. "Bravo One One to Traffic Control, I'm listening, over."
"Bravo One One, we have assigned you a landing slot on tunnel four, airlock delta. Kurs active, ensure your guidance is set
to seven-four-zero and slaved to our control."
He leans over the screen and rapidly checks the docking system's settings. "Control, all in order."
"Bravo One One, stand by."
The next hour passes slowly as the traffic control system guides his Type 921 down to a rocky rendezvous. Orange dust
streaks his one optical-glass porthole: A kilometer before touchdown, Sadeq busies himself closing protective covers, locking
down anything that might fall around on contact. Finally, he unrolls his mat against the floor in front of the console and
floats above it for ten minutes, eyes closed in prayer. It's not the landing that worries him, but what comes next.
Her Majesty's domain stretches out before the battered module like a rust-stained snowflake half a kilometer in diameter. Its
core is buried in a loose snowball of grayish rubble, and it waves languid brittlestar arms at the gibbous orange horizon of
Jupiter. Fine hairs, fractally branching down to the molecular level, split off the main collector arms at regular intervals. A
cluster of habitat pods like seedless grapes cling to the roots of the massive structure. Already he can see the huge steel
generator loops that climb from either pole of the snowflake, wreathed in sparking plasma; the Jovian rings form a rainbow
of darkness rising behind them.
At last, the battered space station is on final approach. Sadeq watches the Kurs simulation output carefully, piping it directly
into his visual field. There's an external camera view of the rockpile and grapes. As the view expands toward the convex
ceiling of the ship, he licks his lips, ready to hit the manual override and go around again – but the rate of descent is
slowing, and by the time he's close enough to see the scratches on the shiny metal docking cone ahead of the ship, it's
measured in centimeters per second. There's a gentle bump, then a shudder, then a rippling bang as the latches on the
docking ring fire – and he's down.
Sadeq breathes deeply again, then tries to stand. There's gravity here, but not much: Walking is impossible. He's about to
head for the life-support panel when he freezes, hearing a noise from the far end of the docking node. Turning, he's just in
time to see the hatch opening toward him, a puff of vapor condensing, and then –
***
Her Imperial Majesty is sitting in the throne room, moodily fidgeting with the new signet ring her equerry has designed for
her. It's a lump of structured carbon massing almost fifty grams, set in a plain band of asteroid-mined iridium. It glitters with
the blue-and-violet speckle highlights of its internal lasers, because, in addition to being a piece of state jewelry, it is also an
optical router, part of the industrial control infrastructure she's building out here on the edge of the solar system. Her
Majesty wears plain black combat pants and sweatshirt, woven from the finest spider silk and spun glass, but her feet are
bare: Her taste in fashion is best described as youthful, and in any event, certain styles are simply impractical in microgravity.
But, being a monarch, she's wearing a crown. And there's a cat, or an artificial entity that dreams it's a cat, sleeping on the
back of her throne.
The lady-in-waiting (and sometime hydroponic engineer) ushers Sadeq to the doorway, then floats back. "If you need
anything, please say," she says shyly, then ducks and rolls away. Sadeq approaches the throne, orients himself on the floor (a
simple slab of black composite, save for the throne growing from its center like an exotic flower), and waits to be noticed.
"Dr. Khurasani, I presume." She smiles at him, neither the innocent grin of a child nor the knowing smirk of an adult: merely
a warm greeting. "Welcome to my kingdom. Please feel free to make use of any necessary support services here, and I wish
you a very pleasant stay."
Sadeq holds his expression still. The queen is young – her face still retains the puppy fat of childhood, emphasized by
microgravity moon-face – but it would be a bad mistake to consider her immature. "I am grateful for Your Majesty's

forbearance," he murmurs, formulaic. Behind her the walls glitter like diamonds, a glowing kaleidoscope vision. It's already the
biggest offshore – or off-planet – data haven in human space. Her crown, more like a compact helm that covers the top and
rear of her head, also glitters and throws off diffraction rainbows; but most of its emissions are in the near ultraviolet,
invisible except for the faint glowing nimbus it creates around her head. Like a halo.
"Have a seat," she offers, gesturing: A ballooning free-fall cradle squirts down and expands from the ceiling, angled toward
her, open and waiting. "You must be tired. Working a ship all by yourself is exhausting." She frowns ruefully, as if
remembering. "Two years is nearly unprecedented."
"Your Majesty is too kind." Sadeq wraps the cradle arms around himself and faces her. "Your labors have been fruitful, I
trust."
She shrugs. "I sell the biggest commodity in short supply on any frontier ..." A momentary grin. "This isn't the Wild West, is
it?"
"Justice cannot be sold," Sadeq says stiffly. Then, a moment later: "My apologies, I mean no insult. I merely believe that, while
you say your goal is to provide the rule of law, what you sell is and must be something different. Justice without God, sold to
the highest bidder, is not justice."
The queen nods. "Leaving aside the mention of God, I agree – I can't sell it. But I can sell participation in a just system. And
this new frontier really is a lot smaller than anyone expected, isn't it? Our bodies may take months to travel between worlds,
but our disputes and arguments take seconds or minutes. As long as everybody agrees to abide by my arbitration, physical
enforcement can wait until they're close enough to touch. And everybody does agree that my legal framework is easier to
comply with, better adjusted to trans-Jovian space, than any earthbound one." A note of steel creeps into her voice,
challenging: Her halo brightens, tickling a reactive glow from the walls of the throne room.
Five billion inputs or more, Sadeq marvels. The crown is an engineering marvel, even though most of its mass is buried in the
walls and floor of this huge construct. "There is law revealed by the Prophet, peace be unto him, and there is law that we
can establish by analysing his intentions. There are other forms of law by which humans live, and various interpretations of
the law of God even among those who study His works. How, in the absence of the word of the Prophet, can you provide a
moral compass?"
"Hmm." She taps her fingers on the arm of her throne, and Sadeq's heart freezes. He's heard the stories from the claim
jumpers and boardroom bandits, from the greenmail experts with their roots in the earthbound jurisdictions that have
made such a hash of arbitration here. How she can experience a year in a minute, rip your memories out through your
cortical implants, and make you relive your worst mistakes in her nightmarishly powerful simulation space. She is the queen –
the first individual to get her hands on so much mass and energy that she could pull ahead of the curve of binding
technology, and the first to set up her own jurisdiction and rule certain experiments to be legal so that she could make use
of the mass/energy intersection. She has force majeure – even the Pentagon's infowarriors respect the Ring Imperium's
autonomy for now. In fact, the body sitting in the throne opposite him probably contains only a fraction of her identity.
She's by no means the first upload or partial, but she's the first gust front of the storm of power that will arrive when the
arrogant ones achieve their goal of dismantling the planets and turning dumb and uninhabited mass into brainpower
throughout the observable reaches of the universe. And he's just questioned the rectitude of her vision, in her presence.
The queen's lips twitch. Then they curl into a wide, carnivorous grin. Behind her, the cat sits up and stretches, then stares at
Sadeq through narrowed eyes.
"You know, that's the first time in weeks that anyone has told me I'm full of shit. You haven't been talking to my mother
again, have you?"
It's Sadeq's turn to shrug, uncomfortably. "I have prepared a judgment," he says slowly.
"Ah." Amber rotates the huge diamond ring around her finger. Then she looks him in the eye, a trifle nervously. Although
what he could possibly do to make her comply with any decree –
"To summarize: Her motive is polluted," Sadeq says shortly.
"Does that mean what I think it does?" she asks.
Sadeq breathes deeply again: "Yes, I think so."
Her smile returns. "And is that the end of it?" she asks.
He raises a dark eyebrow: "Only if you can prove to me that you can have a conscience in the absence of divine revelation."
Her reaction catches him by surprise. "Oh, sure. That's the next part of the program. Obtaining divine revelations."
"What! From the alien?"
The cat, claws extended, delicately picks its way down to her lap and waits to be held and stroked. It never once takes its
eyes off him. "Where else?" she asks. "Doctor, I didn't get the Franklin Trust to loan me the wherewithal to build this castle
just in return for some legal paperwork, and some, ah, interesting legal waivers from Brussels. We've known for years there's
a whole alien packet-switching network out there, and we're just getting spillover from some of their routers. It turns out

there's a node not far away from here, in real space. Helium-three, separate jurisdictions, heavy industrialization on Io –
there is a purpose to all this activity."
Sadeq licks his suddenly dry lips. "You're going to narrowcast a reply?"
"No, much better than that: we're going to visit them. Cut the delay cycle down to real-time. We came here to build a ship
and recruit a crew, even if we have to cannibalize the whole of Jupiter system to pay for the exercise."
The cat yawns then fixes him with a thousand-yard stare. "This stupid girl wants to bring her conscience along to a meeting
with something so smart it might as well be a god," it says. "And she needs to convince the peanut gallery back home that
she's got one, being a born-again atheist and all. Which means, you're it, monkey boy. There's a slot open for the post of
ship's theologian on the first starship out of Jupiter system. I don't suppose I can convince you to turn the offer down?"

Chapter 5: Router
Some years later, two men and a cat are tying one on in a bar that doesn't exist.
The air in the bar is filled with a billowing relativistic smoke cloud – it's a stellarium, accurately depicting the view beyond the
imaginary walls. Aberration of starlight skews the color toward violet around the doorway, brightening in a rainbow mist
over the tables, then dimming to a hazy red glow in front of the raised platform at the back. The Doppler effect has slowly
emerged over the past few months as the ship gathers momentum. In the absence of visible stellar motion – or a hard link to
the ship's control module – it's the easiest way for a drunken passenger to get a feeling for how frighteningly fast the Field
Circus is moving. Some time ago, the ship's momentum exceeded half its rest mass, at which point a single kilogram packs the
punch of a multimegaton hydrogen bomb.
A ginger-and-brown cat – who has chosen to be female, just to mess with the heads of those people who think all ginger cats
are male – sprawls indolently across the wooden floorboards in front of the bar, directly beneath the bridge of the starbow.
Predictably, it has captured the only ray of sunlight to be had within the starship. In the shadows at the back of the bar, two
men slump at a table, lost in their respective morose thoughts: One nurses a bottle of Czech beer, the other a half-empty
cocktail glass.
"It wouldn't be so bad if she is giving me some sign," says one of them, tilting his beer bottle to inspect the bottom for
sediment. "No; that not right. It's the correct kind of attention. Am not knowing where I stand with her."
The other one leans back in his chair, squints at the faded brown paint of the ceiling. "Take it from one who knows," he says:
"If you knew, you'd have nothing to dream about. Anyway, what she wants and what you want may not be the same thing."
The first man runs a hand through his hair. Tight-curled black ringlets briefly turn silver beneath his aging touch. "Pierre, if
talent for making patronizing statements is what you get from tupping Amber –"
Pierre glares at him with all the venom an augmented nineteen-year-old can muster. "Be glad she has no ears in here," he
hisses. His hand tightens around his glass reflexively, but the physics model in force in the bar refuses to let him break it.
"You've had too fucking much to drink, Boris."
A tinkle of icy laughter comes from the direction of the cat. "Shut up, you," says Boris, glancing at the animal. He tips the
bottle back, lets the dregs trickle down his throat. "Maybe you're right. Am sorry. Do not mean to be rude about the
queen." He shrugs, puts the bottle down. Shrugs again, heavily. "Am just getting depressed."
"You're good at that," Pierre observes.
Boris sighs again. "Evidently. If our positions are reversed –"
"I know, I know, you'd be telling me the fun is in the chase and it's not the same when she kicks you out after a fight, and I
wouldn't believe a word of it, being sad and single and all that." Pierre snorts. "Life isn't fair, Boris – live with it."
"I'd better go – " Boris stands.
"Stay away from Ang," says Pierre, still annoyed with him. "At least until you're sober."
"Okay already, stay cool; Am consciously running a watchdog thread." Boris blinks irritably. "Enforcing social behavior. It
doesn't normally allow this drunk. Not where reputation damage are possible in public."
He does a slow dissolve into thin air, leaving Pierre alone in the bar with the cat.
"How much longer do we have to put up with this shit?" he asks aloud. Tempers are frayed, and arguments proliferate
indefinitely in the pocket universe of the ship.
The cat doesn't look round. "In our current reference frame, we drop the primary reflector and start decelerating in
another two million seconds," she says. "Back home, five or six megaseconds."
"That's a big gap. What's the cultural delta up to now?" Pierre asks idly. He snaps his fingers: "Waiter, another cocktail. The
same, if you please."

"Oh, probably about ten to twenty times our departure reference," says the cat. "If you'd been following the news from back
home, you'd have noted a significant speed-up in the deployment of switched entanglement routers. They're having another
networking revolution, only this one will run to completion inside a month because they're using dark fiber that's already in
the ground."
"Switched ... entanglement?" Pierre shakes his head, bemused. The waiter, a faceless body in black tie and a long, starched
apron, walks around the bar and offers him a glass. "That almost sounds as if it makes sense. What else?"
The cat rolls over on her flank, stretches, claws extended. "Stroke me, and I might tell you," she suggests.
"Fuck you, and the dog you rode in on," Pierre replies. He lifts his glass, removes a glacé cherry on a cocktail stick, throws it
toward the spiral staircase that leads down to the toilets, and chugs back half of the drink in one go – freezing pink slush
with an afterbite of caramelized hexose sugars and ethanol. The near spillage as he thumps the glass down serves to
demonstrate that he's teetering on the edge of drunkenness. "Mercenary!"
"Lovesick drug-using human," the cat replies without rancor, and rolls to her feet. She arches her back and yawns, baring
ivory fangs at the world. "You apes – if I cared about you, I'd have to kick sand over you." For a moment she looks faintly
confused. "I mean, I would bury you." She stretches again and glances round the otherwise-empty bar. "By the way, when are
you going to apologize to Amber?"
"I'm not going to fucking apologize to her!" Pierre shouts. In the ensuing silence and confusion, he raises his glass and tries to
drain it, but the ice has all sunk to the bottom, and the resulting coughing fit makes him spray half of the cocktail across the
table. "No way," he rasps quietly.
"Too much pride, huh?" The cat stalks toward the edge of the bar, tail held high with tip bent over in a feline question mark.
"Like Boris with his adolescent woman trouble, too? You primates are so predictable. Whoever thought of sending a starship
crewed by posthuman adolescents –"
"Go 'way," says Pierre: "I've got serious drinking to do."
"To the Macx, I suppose," puns the cat, turning away. But the moody youth has no answer for her, other than to conjure a
refill from the vasty deeps.
***
Meanwhile, in another partition of the Field Circus's reticulated reality, a different instance of the selfsame cat – Aineko by
name, sarcastic by disposition – is talking to its former owner's daughter, the Queen of the Ring Imperium. Amber's avatar
looks about sixteen, with disheveled blonde hair and enhanced cheekbones. It's a lie, of course, because in subjective life
experience, she's in her mid-twenties, but apparent age signifies little in a simulation space populated by upload minds, or in
real space, where post-humans age at different rates.
Amber wears a tattered black dress over iridescent purple leggings, and sprawls lazily across the arms of her informal throne
– an ostentatious lump of nonsense manufactured from a single carbon crystal doped with semiconductors. (Unlike the real
thing back home in Jupiter orbit, this one is merely a piece of furniture for a virtual environment.) The scene is very much
the morning after the evening before, like a goth nightclub gone to seed: all stale smoke and crumpled velvet, wooden
church pews, burned-out candles, and gloomy Polish avant-garde paintings. Any hint of a regal statement the queen might
be making is spoiled by the way she's hooked one knee over the left arm of the throne and is fiddling with a six-axis pointing
device. But these are her private quarters, and she's off duty: The regal person of the Queen is strictly for formal, corporate
occasions.
"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously," she suggests.
"Nope," replies the cat. "It was more like: 'Greetings, earthlings, compile me on your leader.'"
"Well, you got me there," Amber admits. She taps her heel on the throne and fidgets with her signet ring. "No damn way I'm
loading some buggy alien wetware on my sweet gray stuff. Weird semiotics, too. What does Dr. Khurasani say?"
Aineko sits down in the middle of the crimson carpet at the foot of the dais and idly twists round to sniff her crotch. "Sadeq
is immersed in scriptural interpretations. He refused to be drawn."
"Huh." Amber stares at the cat. "So. You've been carrying this lump of source code since when ...?"
"At the signal, for precisely two hundred and sixteen million, four hundred and twenty-nine thousand, and fifty-two
seconds," Aineko supplies, then beeps smugly. "Call it just under six years."
"Right." Amber squeezes her eyes shut. Uneasy possibilities whisper in her mind's ears. "And it began talking to you –"
"– About three million seconds after I picked it up and ran it on a basic environment hosted on a neural network emulator
modeled on the components found in the stomatogastric ganglion of a spiny lobster. Clear?"
Amber sighs. "I wish you'd told Dad about it. Or Annette. Things could have been so different!"
"How?" The cat stops licking her arse and looks up at the queen with a peculiarly opaque stare. "It took the specialists a

decade to figure out the first message was a map of the pulsar neighborhood with directions to the nearest router on the
interstellar network. Knowing how to plug into the router wouldn't help while it was three light-years away, would it?
Besides, it was fun watching the idiots trying to 'crack the alien code' without ever wondering if it might be a reply in a
language we already know to a message we sent out years ago. Fuckwits. And, too, Manfred pissed me off once too often. He
kept treating me like a goddamn house pet."
"But you –" Amber bites her lip. But you were, when he bought you, she had been about to say. Engineered consciousness is
still relatively new: It didn't exist when Manfred and Pamela first hacked on Aineko's cognitive network, and according to the
flat-earth wing of the AI community, it still doesn't. Even she hadn't really believed Aineko's claims to self-awareness until a
couple of years ago, finding it easier to think of the cat as a zimboe – a zombie with no self-awareness, but programmed to
claim to be aware in an attempt to deceive the truly conscious beings around it. "I know you're conscious now, but Manfred
didn't know back then. Did he?"
Aineko glares at her, then slowly narrows her eyes to slits – either feline affection, or a more subtle gesture. Sometimes
Amber finds it hard to believe that, twenty five years ago, Aineko started out as a crude neural network driven toy from a
Far Eastern amusement factory – upgradeable, but still basically a mechanical animal emulator.
"I'm sorry. Let me start again. You actually figured out what the second alien packet was, you, yourself, and nobody else.
Despite the combined efforts of the entire CETI analysis team who spent Gaia knows how many human-equivalent years of
processing power trying to crack its semantics. I hope you'll pardon me for saying I find that hard to believe?"
The cat yawns. "I could have told Pierre instead." Aineko glances at Amber, sees her thunderous expression, and hastily
changes the subject: "The solution was intuitively obvious, just not to humans. You're so verbal." Lifting a hind paw, she
scratches behind her left ear for a moment then pauses, foot waving absentmindedly. "Besides, the CETI team was searching
under the street lights while I was sniffing around in the grass. They kept trying to find primes; when that didn't work, they
started trying to breed a Turing machine that would run it without immediately halting." Aineko lowers her paw daintily.
"None of them tried treating it as a map of a connectionist system based on the only terrestrial components anyone had
ever beamed out into deep space. Except me. But then, your mother had a hand in my wetware, too."
"Treating it as a map –" Amber stops. "You were meant to penetrate Dad's corporate network?"
"That's right," says the cat. "I was supposed to fork repeatedly and gang-rape his web of trust. But I didn't." Aineko yawns.
"Pam pissed me off, too. I don't like people who try to use me."
"I don't care. Taking that thing on board was still a really stupid risk you took," Amber accuses.
"So?" The cat looks at her insolently. "I kept it in my sandbox. And I got it working, on the seven hundred and forty-first
attempt. It'd have worked for Pamela's bounty-hunter friends, too, if I'd tried it. But it's here, now, when you need it. Would
you like to swallow the packet?"
Amber straightens out, sits up in her throne: "I just told you, if you think I'm going to link some flaky chunk of alien neural
programming into my core dialogue, or even my exocortex, you're crazy!" Her eyes narrow. "Can it use your grammar
model?"
"Sure." If the cat was human, it would be shrugging nonchalantly at this point. "It's safe, Amber, really and truly. I found out
what it is."
"I want to talk to it," she says impetuously – and before the cat can reply, adds, "So what is it?"
"It's a protocol stack. Basically it allows new nodes to connect to a network, by providing high-level protocol conversion
services. It needs to learn how to think like a human so it can translate for us when we arrive at the router, which is why
they bolted a lobster's neural network on top of it – they wanted to make it architecturally compatible with us. But there
are no buried time bombs, I assure you: I've had plenty of time to check. Now, are you sure you don't want to let it into
your head?"

Greetings from the fifth decade of the century of wonders.
The solar system that lies roughly twenty-eight trillion kilometers – just short of three light-years – behind
the speeding starwisp Field Circus is seething with change. There have been more technological advances in the
past ten years than in the entire previous expanse of human history – and more unforeseen accidents.
Lots of hard problems have proven to be tractable. The planetary genome and proteome have been mapped
so exhaustively that the biosciences are now focusing on the challenge of the phenome: Plotting the
phase-space defined by the intersection of genes and biochemical structures, understanding how extended
phenotypic traits are generated and contribute to evolutionary fitness. The biosphere has become surreal:
small dragons have been sighted nesting in the Scottish highlands, and in the American midwest, raccoons
have been caught programming microwave ovens.
The computing power of the solar system is now around one thousand MIPS per gram, and is unlikely to
increase in the near term – all but a fraction of one percent of the dumb matter is still locked up below the

accessible planetary crusts, and the sapience/mass ratio has hit a glass ceiling that will only be broken when
people, corporations, or other posthumans get around to dismantling the larger planets. A start has already
been made in Jupiter orbit and the asteroid belt. Greenpeace has sent squatters to occupy Eros and Juno,
but the average asteroid is now surrounded by a reef of specialized nanomachinery and debris, victims of a
cosmic land grab unmatched since the days of the wild west. The best brains flourish in free fall, minds
surrounded by a sapient aether of extensions that out-think their meaty cortices by many orders of
magnitude – minds like Amber, Queen of the Inner Ring Imperium, the first self-extending power center in
Jupiter orbit.
Down at the bottom of the terrestrial gravity well, there has been a major economic catastrophe. Cheap
immortagens, out-of-control personality adjuvants, and a new formal theory of uncertainty have knocked the
bottom out of the insurance and underwriting industries. Gambling on a continuation of the worst aspects
of the human condition – disease, senescence, and death – looks like a good way to lose money, and a
deflationary spiral lasting almost fifty hours has taken down huge swaths of the global stock market. Genius,
good looks, and long life are now considered basic human rights in the developed world: even the poorest
backwaters are feeling extended effects from the commoditization of intelligence.
Not everything is sweetness and light in the era of mature nanotechnology. Widespread intelligence
amplification doesn't lead to widespread rational behavior. New religions and mystery cults explode across
the planet; much of the Net is unusable, flattened by successive semiotic jihads. India and Pakistan have held
their long-awaited nuclear war: external intervention by US and EU nanosats prevented most of the IRBMs
from getting through, but the subsequent spate of network raids and Basilisk attacks cause havoc. Luckily,
infowar turns out to be more survivable than nuclear war – especially once it is discovered that a simple
anti-aliasing filter stops nine out of ten neural-wetware-crashing Langford fractals from causing anything
worse than a mild headache.
New discoveries this decade include the origins of the weakly repulsive force responsible for changes in the
rate of expansion of the universe after the big bang, and on a less abstract level, experimental
implementations of a Turing Oracle using quantum entanglement circuits: a device that can determine
whether a given functional expression can be evaluated in finite time. It's boom time in the field of Extreme
Cosmology, where some of the more recherché researchers are bickering over the possibility that the entire
universe was created as a computing device, with a program encoded in the small print of the Planck
constant. And theorists are talking again about the possibility of using artificial wormholes to provide
instantaneous connections between distant corners of space-time.
Most people have forgotten about the well-known extraterrestrial transmission received fifteen years earlier.
Very few people know anything about the second, more complex transmission received a little later. Many of
those are now passengers or spectators of the Field Circus: a light-sail craft that is speeding out of Sol system
on a laser beam generated by Amber's installations in low-Jupiter orbit. (Superconducting tethers anchored
to Amalthea drag through Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing gigawatts of electricity for the hungry lasers:
energy that comes, in turn, from the small moon's orbital momentum.)
Manufactured by Airbus-Cisco years earlier, the Field Circus is a hick backwater, isolated from the mainstream
of human culture, its systems complexity limited by mass: The destination lies nearly three light-years from
Earth, and even with high acceleration and relativistic cruise speeds, the one-kilogram starwisp and its
hundred-kilogram light sail will take the best part of seven years to get there. Sending a human-sized probe is
beyond even the vast energy budget of the new orbital states in Jupiter system – near-lightspeed travel is
horrifically expensive. Rather than a big, self-propelled ship with canned primates for passengers, as previous
generations had envisaged, the starship is a Coke-can-sized slab of nanocomputers, running a neural
simulation of the uploaded brain states of some tens of humans at merely normal speed. By the time its
occupants beam themselves home again for download into freshly cloned bodies, a linear extrapolation shows
that as much change will have overtaken human civilization as in the preceding fifty millennia – the sum total
of H. sapiens sapiens' time on Earth.
But that's okay by Amber, because what she expects to find in orbit around the brown dwarf Hyundai
+4904/
-56 will be worth the wait.

Pierre is at work in another virtual environment, the one currently running the master control system of the Field Circus.
He's supervising the sail-maintenance 'bots when the message comes in. Two visitors are on their way up the beam from
Jupiter orbit. The only other person around is Su Ang, who showed up sometime after he arrived, and she's busy with some
work of her own. The master control VM – like all the other human-accessible environments at this level of the ship's
virtualization stack – is a construct modeled on a famous movie; this one resembles the bridge of a long-since sunk ocean
liner, albeit with discreetly informative user interfaces hovering in front of the ocean views outside the windows. Polished
brass gleams softly everywhere. "What was that?" he calls out, responding to the soft chime of a bell.
"We have visitors," Ang repeats, interrupting her rhythmic chewing. (She's trying out a betel-nut kick, but she's magicked the
tooth-staining dye away and will probably detox herself in a few hours.) "They're buffering up the line already; just
acknowledging receipt is sucking most of our downstream bandwidth."

"Any idea who they are?" asks Pierre; he puts his boots up on the back of the vacant helmsman's chair and stares moodily at
the endless expanse of green-gray ocean ahead.
Ang chews a bit more, watching him with an expression he can't interpret. "They're still locked," she says. A pause: "But
there was a flash from the Franklins, back home. One of them's some kind of lawyer, while the other's a film producer."
"A film producer?"
"The Franklin Trust says it's to help defray our lawsuit expenses. Myanmar is gaining. They've already subpoenaed Amber's
downline instance, and they're trying to bring this up in some kind of kangaroo jurisdiction – Oregon Christian
Reconstructionist Empire, I think."
"Ouch." Pierre winces. The daily news from Earth, modulated onto a lower-powered communication laser, is increasingly
bad. On the plus side, Amber is incredibly rich: The goodwill futures leveraged off her dad's trust metric means people will
bend over backward to do things for her. And she owns a lot of real estate too, a hundred gigatonnes of rock in low-Jupiter
orbit with enough KE to power Northern Europe for a century. But her interstellar venture burns through money – both
the traditional barter-indirection type and the more creative modern varieties – about the way you would if you heaped up
the green pieces of paper and shoveled them onto a conveyor belt leading to the business end of a running rocket motor.
Just holding off the environmental protests over de-orbiting a small Jovian moon is a grinding job. Moreover, a whole bunch
of national governments have woken up and are trying to legislate themselves a slice of the cake. Nobody's tried to forcibly
take over yet (there are two hundred gigawatts of lasers anchored to the Ring Imperium, and Amber takes her sovereign
status seriously, has even applied for a seat at the UN and membership in the EC), but the nuisance lawsuits are mounting
up into a comprehensive denial of service attack, or maybe economic sanctions. And Uncle Gianni's retirement hasn't helped
any, either. "Anything to say about it?"
"Mmph." Ang looks irritated for some reason. "Wait your turn, they'll be out of the buffer in another couple of days. Maybe
a bit longer in the case of the lawyer, he's got a huge infodump packaged on his person. Probably another semisapient
class-action lawsuit."
"I'll bet. They never learn, do they?"
"What, about the legal system here?"
"Yup." Pierre nods. "One of Amber's smarter ideas, reviving eleventh-century Scots law and updating it with new options on
barratry, trial by combat, and compurgation." He pulls a face and detaches a couple of ghosts to go look out for the new
arrivals; then he goes back to repairing sails. The interstellar medium is abrasive, full of dust – each grain of which carries the
energy of an artillery shell at this speed – and the laser sail is in a constant state of disintegration. A large chunk of the drive
system's mass is silvery utility flakes for patching and replacing the soap-bubble-thin membrane as it ablates away. The skill is
in knowing how best to funnel repair resources to where they're needed, while minimizing tension in the suspension lines
and avoiding resonance and thrust imbalance. As he trains the patch 'bots, he broods about the hate mail from his elder
brother (who still blames him for their father's accident), and about Sadeq's religious injunctions – Superstitious nonsense, he
thinks – and the fickleness of powerful women, and the endless depths of his own nineteen-year-old soul.
While he's brooding, Ang evidently finishes whatever she was doing and bangs out – not even bothering to use the polished
mahogany door at the rear of the bridge, just discorporating and rematerializing somewhere else. Wondering if she's
annoyed, he glances up just as the first of his ghosts patches into his memory map, and he remembers what happened when
it met the new arrival. His eyes widen: "Oh shit!"
It's not the film producer but the lawyer who's just uploaded into the Field Circus's virtual universe. Someone's going to have
to tell Amber. And although the last thing he wants to do is talk to her, it looks like he's going to have to call her, because
this isn't just a routine visit. The lawyer means trouble.

Take a brain and put it in a bottle. Better: take a map of the brain and put it in a map of a bottle – or of a
body – and feed signals to it that mimic its neurological inputs. Read its outputs and route them to a model
body in a model universe with a model of physical laws, closing the loop. René Descartes would understand.
That's the state of the passengers of the Field Circus in a nutshell. Formerly physical humans, their neural
software (and a map of the intracranial wetware it runs on) has been transferred into a virtual machine
environment executing on a honking great computer, where the universe they experience is merely a dream
within a dream.
Brains in bottles – empowered ones, with total, dictatorial, control over the reality they are exposed to –
sometimes stop engaging in activities that brains in bodies can't avoid. Menstruation isn't mandatory.
Vomiting, angina, exhaustion, and cramp are all optional. So is meatdeath, the decomposition of the corpus.
But some activities don't cease, because people (even people who have been converted into a software
description, squirted through a high-bandwidth laser link, and ported into a virtualization stack) don't want
them to stop. Breathing is wholly unnecessary, but suppression of the breathing reflex is disturbing unless
you hack your hypothalamic map, and most homomorphic uploads don't want to do that. Then there's
eating – not to avoid starvation, but for pleasure: Feasts on sautéed dodo seasoned with silphium are readily
available here, and indeed, why not? It seems the human addiction to sensory input won't go away. And
that's without considering sex, and the technical innovations that become possible when the universe – and

the bodies within it – are mutable.

The public audience with the new arrivals is held in yet another movie: the Parisian palace of Charles IX, the throne room
lifted wholesale from La Reine Margot by Patrice Chéreau. Amber insisted on period authenticity, with the realism dialed right
up to eleven. It's 1572 to the hilt this time, physical to the max. Pierre grunts in irritation, unaccustomed to his beard. His
codpiece chafes, and sidelong glances tell him he isn't the only member of the royal court who's uncomfortable. Still, Amber
is resplendent in a gown worn by Isabelle Adjani as Marguerite de Valois, and the luminous sunlight streaming through the
stained-glass windows high above the crowd of actor zimboes lends a certain barbaric majesty to the occasion. The place is
heaving with bodies in clerical robes, doublets, and low-cut gowns – some of them occupied by real people. Pierre sniffs
again: Someone (Gavin, with his history bug, perhaps?) has been working on getting the smells right. He hopes like hell that
nobody throws up. At least nobody seems to have come as Catherine de Médicis ...
A bunch of actors portraying Huguenot soldiers approach the throne on which Amber is seated: They pace slowly forward,
escorting a rather bemused-looking fellow with long, lank hair and a brocade jacket that appears to be made of cloth-of-gold.
"His lordship, Attorney at Arms Alan Glashwiecz!" announces a flunky, reading from a parchment, "here at the behest of the
most excellent guild and corporation of Smoot, Sedgwick Associates, with matters of legal import to discuss with Her Royal
Highness!"
A flourish of trumpets. Pierre glances at Her Royal Highness, who nods gracefully, but is slightly peaky – it's a humid summer
day and her many-layered robes look very hot. "Welcome to the furthermost soil of the Ring Imperium," she announces in a
clear, ringing voice. "I bid you welcome and invite you to place your petition before me in full public session of court."
Pierre directs his attention to Glashwiecz, who appears to be worried. Doubtless he'd absorbed the basics of court protocol
in the Ring (population all of eighteen thousand back home, a growing little principality), but the reality of it, a genuine
old-fashioned monarchy rooted in Amber's three-way nexus of power, data, and time, always takes a while to sink in. "I would
be pleased to do so," he says, a little stiffly, "but in front of all those –"
Pierre misses the next bit, because someone has just goosed him on the left buttock. He starts and half turns to see Su Ang
looking past him at the throne, a lady-in-waiting for the queen. She wears an apricot dress with tight sleeves and a bodice
that bares everything above her nipples. There's a fortune in pearls roped into her hair. As he notices her, she winks at him.
Pierre freezes the scene, decoupling them from reality, and she faces him. "Are we alone now?" she asks.
"Guess so. You want to talk about something?" he asks, heat rising in his cheeks. The noise around them is a random
susurrus of machine-generated crowd scenery, the people motionless as their shared reality thread proceeds independently
of the rest of the universe.
"Of course!" She smiles at him and shrugs. The effect on her chest is remarkable – those period bodices could give a skeleton
a cleavage – and she winks at him again. "Oh, Pierre." She smiles. "So easily distracted!" She snaps her fingers, and her
clothing cycles through Afghani burqua, nudity, trouser suit, then back to court finery. Her grin is the only constant. "Now
that I've got your attention, stop looking at me and start looking at him."
Even more embarrassed, Pierre follows her outstretched arm all the way to the momentarily frozen Moorish emissary.
"Sadeq?"
"Sadeq knows him, Pierre. This guy, there's something wrong."
"Shit. You think I don't know that?" Pierre looks at her with annoyance, embarrassment forgotten. "I've seen him before.
Been tracking his involvement for years. Guy's a front for the Queen Mother. He acted as her divorce lawyer when she went
after Amber's Dad."
"I'm sorry." Ang glances away. "You haven't been yourself lately, Pierre. I know it's something wrong between you and the
Queen. I was worried. You're not paying attention to the little details."
"Who do you think warned Amber?" he asks.
"Oh. Okay, so you're in the loop," she says. "I'm not sure. Anyway, you've been distracted. Is there anything I can do to
help?"
"Listen." Pierre puts his hands on her shoulders. She doesn't move, but looks up into his eyes – Su Ang is only one-sixty tall
– and he feels a pang of something odd: teenage male uncertainty about the friendship of women. What does she want? "I
know, and I'm sorry, and I'll try to keep my eyes on the ball some more, but I've been in my own headspace a lot lately. We
ought to go back into the audience before anybody notices."
"Do you want to talk about the problem first?" she asks, inviting his confidence.
"I –" Pierre shakes his head. I could tell her everything, he realizes shakily as his metaconscience prods him urgently. He's got a
couple of agony-aunt agents, but Ang is a real person and a friend. She won't pass judgment, and her model of human social
behavior is a hell of a lot better than any expert system's. But time is in danger of slipping, and besides, Pierre feels dirty.
"Not now," he says. "Let's go back."

"Okay." She nods, then turns away, steps behind him with a swish of skirts, and he unfreezes time again as they snap back
into place within the larger universe, just in time to see the respected visitor serve the queen with a class-action lawsuit, and
the Queen respond by referring adjudication to trial by combat.

Hyundai +4904/ -56 is a brown dwarf, a lump of dirty hydrogen condensed from a stellar nursery, eight times as massive as
Jupiter but not massive enough to ignite a stable fusion reaction at its core. The relentless crush of gravity has overcome the
mutual repulsion of electrons trapped at its core, shrinking it into a shell of slush around a sphere of degenerate matter. It's
barely larger than the gas giant the human ship uses as an energy source, but it's much denser. Gigayears ago, a chance
stellar near miss sent it careening off into the galaxy on its own, condemned to drift in eternal darkness along with a cluster
of frozen moons that dance attendance upon it.
By the time the Field Circus is decelerating toward it at short range – having shed the primary sail, which drifts farther out
into interstellar space while reflecting light back onto the remaining secondary sail surface to slow the starwisp – Hyundai
+4904/
-56 is just under one parsec distant from Earth, closer even than Proxima Centauri. Utterly dark at visible wavelengths,
the brown dwarf could have drifted through the outer reaches of the solar system before conventional telescopes would
have found it by direct observation. Only an infrared survey in the early years of the current century gave it a name.
A bunch of passengers and crew have gathered on the bridge (now running at one-tenth of real time) to watch the arrival.
Amber sits curled up in the captain's chair, moodily watching the gathered avatars. Pierre is still avoiding her at every
opportunity, formal audiences excepted, and the damned shark and his pet hydra aren't invited, but apart from that, most
of the gang is here. There are sixty-three uploads running on the Field Circus's virtualization stack, software copied out of
meatbodies who are mostly still walking around back home. It's a crowd, but it's possible to feel lonely in a crowd, even when
it's your party. And especially when you're worried about debt, even though you're a billionairess, beneficiary of the human
species' biggest reputations-rating trust fund. Amber's clothing – black leggings, black sweater – is as dark as her mood.
"Something troubles you." A hand descends on the back of the chair next to her.
She glances round momentarily, nods in recognition. "Yeah. Have a seat. You missed the audience?"
The thin, brown-skinned man with a neatly cropped beard and deeply lined forehead slips into the seat next to her. "It was
not part of my heritage," he explains carefully, "although the situation is not unfamiliar." A momentary smile threatens to
crack his stony face. "I found the casting a trifle disturbing."
"I'm no Marguerite de Valois, but the vacant role ... let's just say, the cap fits." Amber leans back in her chair. "Mind you,
Marguerite had an interesting life," she muses.
"Don't you mean depraved and debauched?" her neighbor counters.
"Sadeq." She closes her eyes. "Let's not pick a fight over absolute morality just right now, please? We have an orbital insertion
to carry out, then an artifact to locate, and a dialogue to open, and I'm feeling very tired. Drained."
"Ah – I apologize." He inclines his head carefully. "Is it your young man's fault? Has he slighted you?"
"Not exactly –" Amber pauses. Sadeq, whom she basically invited along as ship's theologian in case they ran into any gods,
has taken up her pastoral well-being as some kind of hobby. She finds it mildly oppressive at times, flattering at others,
surreal always. Using the quantum search resources available to a citizen of the Ring Imperium, he's outpublished his peers,
been elected a hojetolislam at an unprecedentedly young age: His original will probably be an ayatollah by the time they get
home. He's circumspect in dealing with cultural differences, reasons with impeccable logic, carefully avoids antagonizing her –
and constantly seeks to guide her moral development. "It's a personal misunderstanding," she says. "I'd rather not talk about
it until we've sorted it out."
"Very well." He looks unsatisfied, but that's normal. Sadeq still has the dusty soil of a childhood in the industrial city of Yazd
stuck to his boots. Sometimes she wonders if their disagreements don't mirror in miniature the gap between the early
twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. "But back to the here and now. Do you know where this router is?"
"I will, in a few minutes or hours." Amber raises her voice, simultaneously spawning a number of search-ghosts. "Boris! You
got any idea where we're going?"
Boris lumbers round in place to face her; today he's wearing a velociraptor, and they don't turn easily in confined spaces.
He snarls irritably: "Give me some space!" He coughs, a threatening noise from the back of his wattled throat, "Searching the
sail's memory now." The back of the soap-bubble-thin laser sail is saturated with tiny nanocomputers spaced micrometers
apart. Equipped with light receptors and configured as cellular automata, they form a gigantic phased-array detector, a
retina more than a hundred meters in diameter. Boris is feeding them patterns describing anything that differs from the
unchanging starscape. Soon the memories will condense and return as visions of darkness in motion – the cold, dead
attendants of an aborted sun.
"But where is it going to be?" asks Sadeq. "Do you know what you are looking for?"
"Yes. We should have no trouble finding it," says Amber. "It looks like this." She flicks an index finger at the row of glass

windows that front the bridge. Her signet ring flashes ruby light, and something indescribably weird shimmers into view in
place of the seascape. Clusters of pearly beads that form helical chains, disks and whorls of color that interlace and knot
through one another, hang in space above a darkling planet. "Looks like a William Latham sculpture made out of strange
matter, doesn't it?"
"Very abstract," Sadeq says approvingly.
"It's alive," she adds. "And when it gets close enough to see us, it'll try to eat us."
"What?" Sadeq sits up uneasily.
"You mean nobody told you?" asks Amber: "I thought we'd briefed everybody." She throws a glistening golden pomegranate
at him, and he catches it. The apple of knowledge dissolves in his hand, and he sits in a haze of ghosts absorbing information
on his behalf. "Damn," she adds mildly.
Sadeq freezes in place. Glyphs of crumbling stonework overgrown with ivy texture his skin and his dark suit, warning that
he's busy in another private universe.
"Hrrrr! Boss! Found something," calls Boris, drooling on the bridge floor.
Amber glances up. Please, let it be the router, she thinks. "Put it on the main screen."
"Are you sure this is safe?" Su Ang asks nervously.
"Nothing is safe," Boris snaps, clattering his huge claws on the deck. "Here. Look."
The view beyond the windows flips to a perspective on a dusty bluish horizon: swirls of hydrogen brushed with a high cirrus
of white methane crystals, stirred above the freezing point of oxygen by Hyundai +4904/ -56's residual rotation. The
image-intensification level is huge – a naked human eyeball would see nothing but blackness. Rising above the limb of the
gigantic planet is a small pale disk: Callidice, largest moon of the brown dwarf – or second-innermost planet – a barren rock
slightly larger than Mercury. The screen zooms in on the moon, surging across a landscape battered by craters and dusted
with the spume of ice volcanoes. Finally, just above the far horizon, something turquoise shimmers and spins against a
backdrop of frigid darkness.
"That's it," Amber whispers, her stomach turning to jelly as all the terrible might-have-beens dissolve like phantoms of the
night around her; "That's it!" Elated, she stands up, wanting to share the moment with everybody she values. "Wake up,
Sadeq! Someone get that damned cat in here! Where's Pierre? He's got to see this!"

Night and revelry rule outside the castle. The crowds are drunken and rowdy on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day
massacre. Fireworks burst overhead, and the open windows admit a warm breeze redolent of cooked meats, woodsmoke,
open sewers. Meanwhile a lover steals up a tightly-spiraling stone staircase in the near dark; his goal, a prarranged
rendezvous. He's been drinking, and his best linen shirt shows the stains of sweat and food. He pauses at the third window
to breathe in the outside air and run both hands through his mane of hair, which is long, unkempt, and grimy. Why am I
doing this? he wonders. This is so unlike him, this messing around –
He carries on up the spiral. At the top, an oak door gapes on a vestibule lit by a lantern hanging from a hook. He ventures
inside into a reception room paneled in oak blackened by age. Crossing the threshold makes another crossover kick in by
prior arrangement. Something other than his own volition steers his feet, and he feels an unfamiliar throb in his chest,
anticipation and a warmth and looseness lower down that makes him cry out, "where are you?"
"Over here." He sees her waiting for him in the doorway. She's partially undressed, wearing layered underskirts and a
flat-chested corset that makes the tops of her breasts swell like lustrous domes. Her tight sleeves are half-unraveled, her hair
disheveled. He's full of her brilliant eyes, the constriction holding her spine straight, the taste in her mouth. She's the magnet
for his reality, impossibly alluring, so tense she could burst. "Is it working for you?" she asks.
"Yes." he feels tight, breathless, squeezed between impossibility and desire as he walks toward her. They've experimented with
gender play, trying on the extreme dimorphism of this period as a game, but this is the first time they've done it this way.
She opens her mouth: He kisses her, feels the warmth of his tongue thrust between her lips, the strength of his arms
enclosing her waist.
She leans against him, feeling his erection. "So this is how it feels to be you," she says wonderingly. The door to her chamber
is ajar, but she doesn't have the self-restraint to wait: The flood of new sensations – rerouted from her physiology model to
his proprioceptive sensorium – has taken hold. She grinds her hips against him, pushing deeper into his arms, whining softly
at the back of her throat as she feels the fullness in his balls, the tension of his penis. He nearly faints with the rich sensations
of her body – it's as if he's dissolving, feeling the throbbing hardness against his groin, turning to water and running away.
Somehow he gets his arms around her waist – so tight, so breathless – and stumbles forward into the bedroom. She's
whimpering as he drops her on the over-stuffed mattress: "Do it to me!" she demands, "Do it now!"
Somehow he ends up on top of her, hose down around his ankles, skirts bundled up around her waist; she kisses him,
grinding her hips against him and murmuring urgent nothings. Then his heart is in his mouth, and there's a sensation like

the universe pushing into his private parts, so inside out it takes his breath away. It's hot and as hard as rock, and he wants
it inside so badly, but at the same time it's an intrusion, frightening and unexpected. He feels the lightning touch of his
tongue on her nipples as he leans closer, feels exposed and terrified and ecstatic as her private places take in his member. As
he begins to dissolve into the universe he screams in the privacy of his own head, I didn't know it felt like this –
Afterward, she turns to him with a lazy smile, and asks, "How was it for you?" Obviously assuming that, if she enjoyed it, he
must have, too.
But all he can think of is the sensation of the universe thrusting into him, and of how good it felt. All he can hear is his father
yelling ("What are you, some kind of queer?") – and he feels dirty.

Greetings from the last megasecond before the discontinuity.
The solar system is thinking furiously at 1033 MIPS – thoughts bubble and swirl in the equivalent of a million
billion unaugmented human minds. Saturn's rings glow with waste heat. The remaining faithful of the
Latter-Day Saints are correlating the phase-space of their genome and the records of their descent in an
attempt to resurrect their ancestors. Several skyhooks have unfurled in equatorial orbit around the earth
like the graceful fernlike leaves of sundews, ferrying cargo and passengers to and from orbit. Small, crab like
robots swarm the surface of Mercury, exuding a black slime of photovoltaic converters and the silvery
threads of mass drivers. A glowing cloud of industrial nanomes forms a haze around the innermost planet as
it slowly shrinks under the onslaught of copious solar power and determined mining robots.
The original incarnations of Amber and her court float in high orbit above Jupiter, presiding over the huge
nexus of dumb matter trade that is rapidly biting into the available mass of the inner Jovian system. The
trade in reaction mass is brisk, and there are shipments of diamond/vacuum biphase structures to assemble
and crank down into the lower reaches of the solar system. Far below, skimming the edges of Jupiter's
turbulent cloudscape, a gigantic glowing figure-of-eight – a five-hundred-kilometer-long loop of
superconducting cable – traces incandescent trails through the gas giant's magnetosphere. It's trading
momentum for electrical current, diverting it into a fly's eye grid of lasers that beam it toward Hyundai
+4904/ . As long as the original Amber and her incarnate team can keep it running, the Field Circus can
-56
continue its mission of discovery, but they're part of the posthuman civilization evolving down in the
turbulent depths of Sol system, part of the runaway train being dragged behind the out-of-control engine of
history.
Weird new biologies based on complex adaptive matter take shape in the sterile oceans of Titan. In the frigid
depths beyond Pluto, supercooled boson gases condense into impossible dreaming structures, packaged for
shipping inward to the fast-thinking core.
There are still humans dwelling down in the hot depths, but it's getting hard to recognize them. The lot of
humanity before the twenty-first century was nasty, brutish, and short. Chronic malnutrition, lack of
education, and endemic diseases led to crippled minds and broken bodies. Now, most people multitask: Their
meatbrains sit at the core of a haze of personality, much of it virtualized on stacked layers of structured
reality far from their physical bodies. Wars and revolutions, or their subtle latter-day cognates, sweep the
globe as constants become variables; many people find the death of stupidity even harder to accept than the
end of mortality. Some have vitrified themselves to await an uncertain posthuman future. Others have
modified their core identities to better cope with the changed demands of reality. Among these are beings
whom nobody from a previous century would recognize as human – human/corporation half-breeds,
zombie clades dehumanized by their own optimizations, angels and devils of software, slyly self-aware financial
instruments. Even their popular fictions are self-deconstructing these days.
None of this, other than the barest news summary, reaches the Field Circus: The starwisp is a fossil, left behind
by the broad sweep of accelerating progress. But it is aboard the Field Circus that some of the most important
events remaining in humanity's future light cone take place.

"Say hello to the jellyfish, Boris."
Boris, in human drag, for once, glares at Pierre, and grips the pitcher with both hands. The contents of the jug swirl their
tentacles lazily: One of them flips almost out of solution, dislodging an impaled cocktail cherry. "Will get you for this," Boris
threatens. The smoky air around his head is a-swirl with daemonic visions of vengeance.
Su Ang stares intently at Pierre who is watching Boris as he raises the jug to his lips and begins to drink. The baby jellyfish –
small, pale blue, with cuboid bells and four clusters of tentacles trailing from each corner – slips down easily. Boris winces
momentarily as the nematocysts let rip inside his mouth, but in a moment or so, the cubozoan slips down, and in the
meantime, his biophysics model clips the extent of the damage to his stinger-ruptured oropharynx.
"Wow," he says, taking another slurp of sea wasp margaritas. "Don't try this at home, fleshboy."

"Here." Pierre reaches out. "Can I?"
"Invent your own damn poison," Boris sneers – but he releases the jug and passes it to Pierre, who raises it and drinks. The
cubozoan cocktail reminds him of fruit jelly drinks in a hot Hong Kong summer. The stinging in his palate is sharp but fades
rapidly, producing an intimate burn when the alcohol hits the mild welts that are all this universe will permit the lethal
medusa to inflict on him.
"Not bad," says Pierre, wiping a stray loop of tentacle off his chin. He pushes the pitcher across the table toward Su Ang.
"What's with the wicker man?" He points a thumb over his back at the table jammed in the corner opposite the
copper-topped bar.
"Who cares?" asks Boris."'S part of the scenery, isn't it?"
The bar is a three-hundred-year-old brown café with a beer menu that runs to sixteen pages and wooden walls stained the
color of stale ale. The air is thick with the smells of tobacco, brewer's yeast, and melatonin spray: and none of it exists.
Amber dragged it out of the Franklin borg's collective memories, by way of her father's scattershot e-mails annotating her
corporeal origins – the original is in Amsterdam, if that city still exists.
"I care who it is," says Pierre.
"Save it," Ang says quietly. "I think it's a lawyer with a privacy screen."
Pierre glances over his shoulder and glares. "Really?"
Ang puts a restraining hand on his wrist: "Really. Don't pay it any attention. You don't have to, until the trial, you know."
The wicker man sits uneasily in the corner. It resembles a basket-weave silhouette made from dried reeds, dressed in a red
kerchief. A glass of doppelbock fills the mess of tied-off ends where its right hand ought to be. From time to time, it raises the
glass as if to take a mouthful, and the beer vanishes into the singular interior.
"Fuck the trial," Pierre says shortly. And fuck Amber, too, for naming me her public defender –
"Since when do lawsuits come with an invisible man?" asks Donna the Journalist, blitting into the bar along with a patchy
historical trail hinting that she's just come from the back room.
"Since –" Pierre blinks. "Hell." When Donna entered, so did Aineko; or maybe the cat's been there all the time, curled up
loaf-of-bread fashion on the table in front of the wicker man. "You're damaging the continuity," Pierre complains. "This
universe is broken."
"Fix it yourself," Boris tells him. "Everybody else is coping." He snaps his fingers. "Waiter!"
"Excuse me." Donna shakes her head. "I didn't mean to harm anything."
Ang, as always, is more accommodating. "How are you?" she asks politely: "Would you like to try this most excellent poison
cocktail?"
"I am well," says Donna. A heavily built German woman – blonde and solidly muscular, according to the avatar she's
presenting to the public – she's surrounded by a haze of viewpoints. They're camera angles on her society of mind, busily
integrating and splicing her viewpoint threads together in an endless journal of the journey. A stringer for the CIA media
consortium, she uploaded to the ship in the same packet stream as the lawsuit. "Danke, Ang."
"Are you recording right now?" asks Boris.
Donna sniffs. "When am I not?" A momentary smile: "I am only a scanner, no? Five hours, until arrival, to go. I may stop after
then." Pierre glances across the table at Su Ang's hands; her knuckles are white and tense. "I am to avoid missing anything if
possible," Donna continues, oblivious to Ang's disquiet. "There are eight of me at present! All recording away."
"That's all?" Ang asks, raising an eyebrow.
"Yes, that is all, and I have a job to do! Don't tell me you do not enjoy what it is that you do here?"
"Right." Pierre glances in the corner again, avoiding eye contact with the hearty Girl Friday wannabe. He has a feeling, that if
there were any hills hereabouts to animate, she'd be belting out the music. "Amber told you about the privacy code here?"
"There is a privacy code?" asks Donna, swinging at least three subjective ghosts to bear on him for some reason – evidently
he's hit an issue she has mixed feelings about.
"A privacy code," Pierre confirms. "No recording in private, no recording where people withhold permission in public, and
no sandboxes and cutups."
Donna looks offended. "I would never do such a thing! Trapping a copy of someone in a virtual space to record their
responses would be assault under Ring legal code, not true?"

"Your mother," Boris says snidely, brandishing a fresh jug of iced killer jellyfish in her direction.
"As long as we all agree," Ang interrupts, searching for accord. "It's all going to be settled soon, isn't it?"
"Except for the lawsuit," mutters Pierre, glancing at the corner again.
"I don't see the problem," says Donna, "that's just between Amber and her downlink adversaries!"
"Oh, it's a problem all right," says Boris, his tone light. "What are your options worth?"
"My –" Donna shakes her head. "I'm not vested."
"Plausible." Boris doesn't crack a smile. "Even so, when we go home, your credibility metric will bulge. Assuming people still
use distributed trust markets to evaluate the stability of their business partners."
Not vested. Pierre turns it over in his mind, slightly surprised. He'd assumed that everybody aboard the ship – except,
perhaps, the lawyer, Glashwiecz – was a fully vested member of the expeditionary company.
"I am not vested," Donna insists. "I'm listed independently." For a moment, an almost-smile tugs at her face, a charmingly
reticent expression that has nothing to do with her bluff exterior. "Like the cat."
"The –" Pierre turns round in a hurry. Yes, Aineko appears to be sitting silently at the table with the wicker man; but who
knows what's going through that furry head right now? I'll have to bring this up with Amber, he realizes uneasily. I ought to
bring this up with Amber ... "but your reputation won't suffer for being on this craft, will it?" he asks aloud.
"I will be all right," Donna declares. The waiter comes over: "Mine will be a bottle of schneiderweisse," she adds. And then,
without breaking step: "Do you believe in the singularity?"
"Am I a singularitarian, do you mean?" asks Pierre, a fixed grin coming to his face.
"Oh, no, no, no!" Donna waves him down, grins broadly, nods at Su Ang: "I do not mean it like that! Attend: What I meant
to ask was whether you in the concept of a singularity believe, and if so, where it is?"
"Is this intended for a public interview?" asks Ang.
"Well, I cannot into a simulation drag you off and expose you to an imitative reality excursion, can I?" Donna leans back as
the bartender places a ceramic stein in front of her.
"Oh. Well." Ang glances warningly at Pierre and dispatches a very private memo to scroll across his vision: Don't play with her,
this is serious. Boris is watching Ang with an expression of hopeless longing. Pierre tries to ignore it all, taking the journalist's
question seriously. "The singularity is a bit like that old-time American Christian rapture nonsense, isn't it?" he says. "When
we all go a-flying up to heaven, leaving our bodies behind." He snorts, reaches into thin air and gratuitously violates causality
by summoning a jug of ice-cold sangria into existence. "The rapture of the nerds. I'll drink to that."
"But when did it take place?" asks Donna. "My audience, they will to know your opinion be needing."
"Four years ago, when we instantiated this ship," Pierre says promptly.
"Back in the teens," says Ang. "When Amber's father liberated the uploaded lobsters."
"Is not happening yet," contributes Boris. "Singularity implies infinite rate of change achieved momentarily. Future not
amenable thereafter to prediction by presingularity beings, right? So has not happened."
"Au contraire. It happened on June 6th, 1969, at eleven hundred hours, eastern seaboard time," Pierre counters. "That was
when the first network control protocol packets were sent from the data port of one IMP to another – the first ever
Internet connection. That's the singularity. Since then we've all been living in a universe that was impossible to predict from
events prior to that time."
"It's rubbish," counters Boris. "Singularity is load of religious junk. Christian mystic rapture recycled for atheist nerds."
"Not so." Su Ang glances at him, hurt. "Here we are, sixty something human minds. We've been migrated – while still awake
– right out of our own heads using an amazing combination of nanotechnology and electron spin resonance mapping, and
we're now running as software in an operating system designed to virtualize multiple physics models and provide a simulation
of reality that doesn't let us go mad from sensory deprivation! And this whole package is about the size of a fingertip,
crammed into a starship the size of your grandmother's old Walkman, in orbit around a brown dwarf just over three
light-years from home, on its way to plug into a network router created by incredibly ancient alien intelligences, and you can
tell me that the idea of a fundamental change in the human condition is nonsense?"
"Mmph." Boris looks perplexed. "Would not put it that way. The singularity is nonsense, not uploading or –"
"Yah, right." Ang smiles winningly at Boris. After a moment, he wilts.
Donna beams at them enthusiastically. "Fascinating!" she enthuses. "Tell me, what are these lobsters you think are important?"

"They're Amber's friends," Ang explains. "Years ago, Amber's father did a deal with them. They were the first uploads, you
know? Hybridized spiny lobster neural tissue and a heuristic API and some random mess of backward-chaining expert
systems. They got out of their lab and into the Net and Manfred brokered a deal to set them free, in return for their help
running a Franklin orbital factory. This was way back in the early days before they figured out how to do self-assembly
properly. Anyway, the lobsters insisted – part of their contract – that Bob Franklin pay to have the deep-space tracking
network beam them out into interstellar space. They wanted to emigrate, and looking at what's happened to the solar system
since then, who can blame them?"
Pierre takes a big mouthful of sangria. "The cat," he says.
"The cat –" Donna's head swivels round, but Aineko has banged out again, retroactively editing her presence out of the
event history of this public space. "What about the cat?"
"The family cat," explains Ang. She reaches over for Boris's pitcher of jellyfish juice, but frowns as she does so: "Aineko wasn't
conscious back then, but later ... when SETI@home finally received that message back, oh, however many years ago, Aineko
remembered the lobsters. And cracked it wide open while all the CETI teams were still thinking in terms of von Neumann
architectures and concept-oriented programming. The message was a semantic net designed to mesh perfectly with the
lobster broadcast all those years ago, and provide a high-level interface to a communications network we're going to visit."
She squeezes Boris's fingertips. "SETI@home logged these coordinates as the origin of the transmission, even though the
public word was that the message came from a whole lot farther away – they didn't want to risk a panic if people knew there
were aliens on our cosmic doorstep. Anyway, once Amber got established, she decided to come visiting. Hence this
expedition. Aineko created a virtual lobster and interrogated the ET packet, hence the communications channel we're about
to open."
"Ah, this is all a bit clearer now," says Donna. "But the lawsuit – " She glances at the hollow wicker man in the corner.
"Well, there we have a problem," Ang says diplomatically.
"No," says Pierre. "I have a problem. And it's all Amber's fault."
"Hmm?" Donna stares at him. "Why blame the Queen?"
"Because she's the one who picked the lunar month to be the reporting time period for companies in her domain, and
specified trial by combat for resolving corporate conflicts," he grumbles. "And compurgation, but that's not applicable to this
case because there isn't a recognized reputation server within three light-years. Trial by combat, for civil suits in this day and
age! And she appointed me her champion." In the most traditional way imaginable, he remembers with a warm frisson of
nostalgia. He'd been hers in body and soul before that disastrous experiment. He isn't sure whether it still applies, but – "I've
got to take on this lawsuit on her behalf, in adversarial stance."
He glances over his shoulder. The wicker man sits there placidly, pouring beer down his invisible throat like a tired farm
laborer.
"Trial by combat," Su Ang explains to Donna's perplexed ghost-swarm, which is crawling all over the new concept in a haze
of confusion. "Not physical combat, but a competition of ability. It seemed like a good idea at the time, to keep junk litigants
out of the Ring Imperium, but the Queen Mother's lawyers are very persistent. Probably because it's taken on something of a
grudge match quality over the years. I don't think Pamela cares much anymore, but this ass-hat lawyer has turned it into a
personal crusade. I don't think he liked what happened when the music Mafiya caught up with him. But there's a bit more to
it, because if he wins, he gets to own everything. And I mean everything."
***
Ten million kilometers out and Hyundai +4904/ -56 looms beyond the parachute-shaped sail of the Field Circus like a rind of
darkness bitten out of the edge of the universe. Heat from the gravitational contraction of its core keeps it warm, radiating
at six hundred degrees absolute, but the paltry emission does nothing to break the eternal ice that grips Callidice, Iambe,
Celeus, and Metaneira, the stillborn planets locked in orbit around the brown dwarf.
Planets aren't the only structures that orbit the massive sphere of hydrogen. Close in, skimming the cloud tops by only
twenty thousand kilometers, Boris's phased-array eye has blinked at something metallic and hot. Whatever it is, it orbits out
of the ecliptic plane traced by the icy moons, and in the wrong direction. Farther out, a speckle of reflected emerald laser
light picks out a gaudy gem against the starscape: their destination, the router.
"That's it," says Boris. His body shimmers into humanity, retconning the pocket universe of the bridge into agreeing that he's
been present in primate form all along. Amber glances sideways. Sadeq is still wrapped in ivy, his skin the texture of
weathered limestone. "Closest approach is sixty-three light-seconds, due in eight hundred thousand. Can give you closer
contact if we maneuver, but will take time to achieve a stable orbit."
Amber nods thoughtfully, sending copies of herself out to work the mechanics. The big light sail is unwieldy, but can take
advantage of two power sources: the original laser beam from Jupiter, and its reflection bouncing off the now-distant primary
light sail. The temptation is to rely on the laser for constant acceleration, to just motor on in and squat on the router's
cosmic doorstep. But the risk of beam interruption is too dangerous. It's happened before, for seconds to minutes at a time,
on six occasions during the voyage so far. She's not sure what causes the beam downtime (Pierre has a theory about Oort
cloud objects occulting the laser, but she figures it's more likely to be power cuts back at the Ring), but the consequences of

losing power while maneuvering deep in a quasi-stellar gravity well are much more serious than a transient loss of thrust
during free interstellar flight. "Let's just play it safe," she says. "We'll go for a straight orbital insertion and steady cranking
after that. We've got enough gravity wells to play pinball with. I don't want us on a free-flight trajectory that entails
lithobraking if we lose power and can't get the sail back."
"Very prudent," Boris agrees. "Marta, work on it." A buzzing presence of not-insects indicates that the heteromorphic
helmswoman is on the job. "I think we should be able to take our first close-in look in about two million seconds, but if you
want, I can ping it now ...?"
"No need for protocol analysis," Amber says casually. "Where's – ah, there you are." She reaches down and picks up Aineko,
who twists round sinuously and licks her arm with a tongue like sandpaper. "What do you think?"
"Do you want fries with that?" asks the cat, focusing on the artifact at the center of the main screen in front of the bridge.
"No, I just want a conversation," says Amber.
"Well, okay." The cat dims, moves jerkily, sucking up local processing power so fast that it disturbs the local physics model.
"Opening port now."
A subjective minute or two passes. "Where's Pierre?" Amber asks herself quietly. Some of the maintenance metrics she can
read from her privileged viewpoint are worrying. The Field Circus is running at almost eighty percent of utilization. Whatever
Aineko is doing in order to establish the interface to the router, it's taking up an awful lot of processing power and
bandwidth. "And where's the bloody lawyer?" she adds, almost as an afterthought.
The Field Circus is small, but its light sail is highly controllable. Aineko takes over a cluster of cells in its surface, turning them
from straight reflectors into phase-conjugate mirrors: A small laser on the ship's hull begins to flicker thousands of times a
second, and the beam bounces off the modified segment of mirror, focusing to a coherent point right in front of the distant
blue dot of the router. Aineko ramps up the modulation frequency, adds a bundle of channels using different wavelengths,
and starts feeding out a complex set of preplanned signals that provide an encoding format for high-level data.
"Leave the lawyer to me." She starts, glancing sideways to see Sadeq watching her. He smiles without showing his teeth.
"Lawyers do not mix with diplomacy," he explains.
"Huh." Ahead of them, the router is expanding. Strings of nacreous spheres curl in strange loops around a hidden core,
expanding and turning inside out in systolic pulses that spawn waves of recomplication through the structure. A loose red
speckle of laser light stains one arm of beads; suddenly it flares up brilliantly, reflecting data back at the ship. "Ah!"
"Contact," purrs the cat. Amber's fingertips turn white where she grips the arms of her chair.
"What does it say?" she asks, quietly.
"What do they say," corrects Aineko. "It's a trade delegation, and they're uploading right now. I can use that negotiation
network they sent us to give them an interface to our systems if you want."
"Wait!" Amber half stands in sudden nervousness. "Don't give them free access! What are you thinking of? Stick them in the
throne room, and we'll give them a formal audience in a couple of hours." She pauses. "That network layer they sent
through. Can you make it accessible to us, use it to give us a translation layer into their grammar-mapping system?"
The cat looks round, thumps her tail irritably: "You'd do better loading the network yourself –"
"I don't want anybody on this ship running alien code before we've vetted it thoroughly," she says urgently. "In fact, I want
them bottled up in the Louvre grounds, just as thoroughly as we can, and I want them to come to us through our own
linguistic bottleneck. Got that?"
"Clear," Aineko grumbles.
"A trade delegation," Amber thinks aloud. "What would Dad make of that?"
***
One moment he's in the bar, shooting bull with Su Ang and Donna the Journalist's ghost and a copy of Boris; the next he's
abruptly precipitated into a very different space.
Pierre's heart seems to tumble within his rib cage, but he forces himself to stay calm as he glances around the dim,
oak-paneled chamber. This is wrong, so wrong that it signifies either a major systems crash or the application of frightening
privilege levels to his realm. The only person aboard who's entitled to those privileges is –
"Pierre?"
She's behind him. He turns angrily. "Why did you drag me in here? Don't you know it's rude to –"
"Pierre."

He stops and looks at Amber. He can't stay angry at her for long, not to her face. She's not dumb enough to bat her
eyelashes at him, but she's disarmingly cute for all that. Nevertheless, something inside him feels shriveled and wrong in her
presence. "What is it?" he says, curtly.
"I don't know why you've been avoiding me." She starts to take a step forward, then stops and bites her lip. Don't do this to
me! he thinks. "You know it hurts?"
"Yes." That much of an admission hurts him, too. He can hear his father yelling over his shoulder, the time he found him
with Laurent, elder brother: It's a choice between père or Amber, but it's not a choice he wants to make. The shame. "I
didn't – I have some issues."
"It was the other night?"
He nods. Now she takes a step forwards. "We can talk about it, if you want. Whatever you want," she says. And she leans
toward him, and he feels his resistance crumbling. He reaches out and hugs her, and she wraps her arms around him and
leans her chin on his shoulder, and this doesn't feel wrong: How can anything this good be bad?
"It made me uncomfortable," he mumbles into her hair. "Need to sort myself out."
"Oh, Pierre." She strokes the down at the back of his neck. "You should have said. We don't have to do it that way if you
don't want to."
How to tell her how hard it is to admit that anything's wrong? Ever? "You didn't drag me here to tell me that," he says,
implicitly changing the subject.
Amber lets go of him, backs away almost warily. "What is it?" she asks.
"Something's wrong?" he half asks, half asserts. "Have we made contact yet?"
"Yeah," she says, pulling a face. "There's an alien trade delegation in the Louvre. That's the problem."
"An alien trade delegation." He rolls the words around the inside of his mouth, tasting them. They feel paradoxical, cold and
slow after the hot words of passion he's been trying to avoid uttering. It's his fault for changing the subject.
"A trade delegation," says Amber. "I should have anticipated. I mean, we were going to go through the router ourselves,
weren't we?"
He sighs. "We thought we were going to do that." A quick prod at the universe's controls determines that he has certain
capabilities: He invokes an armchair, sprawls across it. "A network of point-to-point wormholes linking routers,
self-replicating communication hubs, in orbit around most of the brown dwarfs of the galaxy. That's what the brochure said,
right? That's what we expected. Limited bandwidth, not a lot of use to a mature superintelligence that has converted the free
mass of its birth solar system into computronium, but sufficient to allow it to hold conversations with its neighbors.
Conversations carried out via a packet-switched network in real time, not limited by the speed of light, but bound together
by a common reference frame and the latency between network hops."
"That's about the size of it," she agrees from the carved-ruby throne beside him. "Except there's a trade delegation waiting
for us. In fact, they're coming aboard already. And I don't buy it – something about the whole setup stinks."
Pierre's brow wrinkles. "You're right, it doesn't make sense," he says, finally. "Doesn't make sense at all."
Amber nods. "I carry a ghost of Dad around. He's really upset about it."
"Listen to your old man." Pierre's lips quirk humorlessly. "We were going to jump through the looking glass, but it seems
someone has beaten us to the punch. Question is why?"
"I don't like it." Amber reaches out sideways, and he catches her hand. "And then there's the lawsuit. We have to hold the
trial sooner rather than later."
He lets go of her fingers. "I'd really be much happier if you hadn't named me as your champion."
"Hush." The scenery changes; her throne is gone, and instead she's sitting on the arm of his chair, almost on top of him.
"Listen. I had a good reason."
"Reason?"
"You have choice of weapons. In fact, you have the choice of the field. This isn't just 'hit 'em with a sword until they die'
time." She grins, impishly. "The whole point of a legal system that mandates trial by combat for commercial lawsuits, as
opposed to an adjudication system, is to work out who's a fitter servant of society and hence deserving of preferential
treatment. It's crazy to apply the same legal model to resolving corporate disputes that we use for arguments among people,
especially as most companies are now software abstractions of business models; the interests of society are better served by a
system that encourages efficient trade activity than by one that encourages litigation. It cuts down on corporate bullshit while
encouraging the toughest ones to survive, which is why I was going to set up the trial as a contest to achieve maximum
competitive advantage in a xenocommerce scenario. Assuming they really are traders, I figure we have more to trade with

them than some damn lawyer from the depths of earth's light cone."
Pierre blinks. "Um." Blinks again. "I thought you wanted me to sideload some kind of fencing kinematics program and skewer
the guy?"
"Knowing how well I know you, why did you ever think that?" She slides down the arm of his chair and lands on his lap. She
twists round to face him in point-blank close-up. "Shit, Pierre, I know you're not some kind of macho psychopath!"
"But your mother's lawyers –"
She shrugs dismissively. "They're lawyers. Used to dealing with precedents. Best way to fuck with their heads is to change the
way the universe works." She leans against his chest. "You'll make mincemeat of them. Profit-to-earnings ratio through the
roof, blood on the stock exchange floor." His hands meet around the small of her back. "My hero!"
***
The Tuileries are full of confused lobsters.
Aineko has warped this virtual realm, implanting a symbolic gateway in the carefully manicured gardens outside. The gateway
is about two meters in diameter, a verdigris-coated orouborous loop of bronze that sits like an incongruous archway astride
a gravel path in the grounds. Giant black lobsters – each the size of a small pony – shuffle out of the loop's baby blue buffer
field, antennae twitching. They wouldn't be able to exist in the real world, but the physics model here has been amended to
permit them to breathe and move, by special dispensation.
Amber sniffs derisively as she enters the great reception room of the Sully wing. "Can't trust that cat with anything," she
mutters.
"It was your idea, wasn't it?" asks Su Ang, trying to duck past the zombie ladies-in-waiting who carry Amber's train. Soldiers
line the passage to either side, forming rows of steel to let the Queen pass unhindered.
"To let the cat have its way, yes," Amber is annoyed. "But I didn't mean to let it wreck the continuity! I won't have it!"
"I never saw the point of all this medievalism, before," Ang observes. "It's not as if you can avoid the singularity by hiding in
the past." Pierre, following the Queen at a distance, shakes his head, knowing better than to pick a fight with Amber over her
idea of stage scenery.
"It looks good," Amber says tightly, standing before her throne and waiting for the ladies-in-waiting to arrange themselves
before her. She sits down carefully, her back straight as a ruler, voluminous skirts belling up. Her dress is an intricate piece
of sculpture that uses the human body within as a support. "It impresses the yokels and looks convincing on narrowcast
media. It provides a prefabricated sense of tradition. It hints at the political depths of fear and loathing intrinsic to my court's
activities, and tells people not to fuck with me. It reminds us where we've come from ... and it doesn't give away anything
about where we're going."
"But that doesn't make any difference to a bunch of alien lobsters," points out Su Ang. "They lack the reference points to
understand it." She moves to stand behind the throne. Amber glances at Pierre, waves him over.
Pierre glances around, seeking real people, not the vacant eigenfaces of the zombies that give this scenery added biological
texture. There in the red gown, isn't that Donna the Journalist? And over there, too, with shorter hair and wearing male
drag; she gets everywhere. That's Boris, sitting behind the bishop.
"You tell her," Ang implores him.
"I can't," he admits. "We're trying to establish communication, aren't we? But we don't want to give too much away about
what we are, how we think. A historical distancing act will keep them from learning too much about us: The phase-space of
technological cultures that could have descended from these roots is too wide to analyse easily. So we're leaving them with
the lobster translators and not giving anything away. Try to stay in character as a fifteenth-century duchess from Albì – it's a
matter of national security."
"Humph." Ang frowns as a flunky hustles forward to place a folding chair behind her. She turns to face the expanse of
red-and-gold carpet that stretches to the doorway as trumpets blat and the doors swing open to admit the deputation of
lobsters.
The lobsters are as large as wolves, black and spiny and ominous. Their monochrome carapaces are at odds with the brightly
colored garb of the human crowd. Their antennae are large and sharp as swords. But for all that, they advance hesitantly,
eye turrets swiveling from side to side as they take the scene in. Their tails drag ponderously on the carpet, but they have no
trouble standing.
The first of the lobsters halts short of the throne and angles itself to train an eye on Amber. "Am inconsistent," it complains.
"There is no liquid hydrogen monoxide here, and you-species am misrepresented by initial contact. Inconsistency, explain?"
"Welcome to the human physical space-traveling interface unit Field Circus," Amber replies calmly. "I am pleased to see your
translator is working adequately. You are correct, there is no water here. The lobsters don't normally need it when they visit
us. And we humans are not water-dwellers. May I ask who you are when you're not wearing borrowed lobster bodies?"

Confusion. The second lobster rears up and clatters its long, armored antennae together. Soldiers to either side tighten their
grips on their spears, but it drops back down again soon enough.
"We are the Wunch," announces the first lobster, speaking clearly. "This is a body-compliant translation layer. Based on map
received from yourspace, units forty thousand trillion light-kilometers ago?"
"He means twenty years," Pierre whispers on a private channel Amber has multicast for the other real humans in the audience
chamber reality. "They've confused space and time for measurement purposes. Does this tell us something?"
"Relatively little," comments someone else – Chandra? A round of polite laughter greets the joke, and the tension in the room
eases slightly.
"We are the Wunch," the lobster repeats. "We come to exchange interest. What have you got that we want?"
Faint frown lines appear on Amber's forehead. Pierre can see her thinking very rapidly. "We consider it impolite to ask," she
says quietly.
Clatter of claws on underlying stone floor. Chatter of clicking mandibles. "You accept our translation?" asks the leader.
"Are you referring to the transmission you sent us, uh, thirty thousand trillion light-kilometers behind?" asks Amber.
The lobster bobs up and down on its legs. "True. We send."
"We cannot integrate that network," Amber replies blandly, and Pierre forces himself to keep a straight face. (Not that the
lobsters can read human body language yet, but they'll undoubtedly be recording everything that happens here for future
analysis.) "They come from a radically different species. Our goal in coming here is to connect our species to the network.
We wish to exchange advantageous information with many other species."
Concern, alarm, agitation. "You cannot do that! You are not untranslatable entity signifier."
Amber raises a hand. "You said untranslatable entity signifier. I did not understand that. Can you paraphrase?"
"We, like you, are not untranslatable entity signifier. The network is for untranslatable entity signifier. We are to the untranslatable
concept #1 as a single-celled organism is to ourselves. You and we cannot untranslatable concept #2. To attempt trade with
untranslatable entity signifier is to invite death or transition to untranslatable concept #1."
Amber snaps her fingers: time freezes. She glances round at Su Ang, Pierre, the other members of her primary team.
"Opinions, anyone?"
Aineko, hitherto invisible, sits up on the carpet at the foot of the dais. "I'm not sure. The reason those macros are tagged is
that there's something wrong with their semantics."
"Wrong with – how?" asks Su Ang.
The cat grins, cavernously, and begins to fade. "Wait!" snaps Amber.
Aineko continues her fade, but leaves a shimmering presence behind: not a grin, but a neural network weighting map,
three-dimensional and incomprehensibly complicated. "The untranslatable entity concept #1 when mapped onto the lobster's
grammar network has elements of 'god' overloaded with attributes of mysticism and zenlike incomprehensibility. But I'm
pretty sure that what it really means is 'optimized conscious upload that runs much faster than real-time'. A type-one weakly
superhuman entity, like, um, the folks back home. The implication is that this Wunch wants us to view them as gods." The cat
fades back in. "Any takers?"
"Small-town hustlers," mutters Amber. "Talking big – or using a dodgy metagrammar that makes them sound bigger than
they are – to bilk the hayseeds new to the big city."
"Most likely." Aineko turns and begins to wash her flank.
"What are we going to do?" asks Su Ang.
"Do?" Amber raises a pencil-lined eyebrow, then flashes a grin that chops a decade off her apparent age: "We're going to
mess with their heads!" She snaps her fingers again and time unfreezes. There's no change in continuity except that Aineko is
still present, at the foot of the throne. The cat looks up and gives the queen a dirty look. "We understand your concern,"
Amber says smoothly, "but we have already given you the physiology models and neural architecture of the bodies that you
are wearing. We want to communicate. Why won't you show us your real selves or your real language?"
"This is trade language!" protests Lobster Number One. "Wunch am/are metabolically variable coalition from number of
worlds. No uniformity of interface. Easiest to conform to one plan and speak one tongue optimized for your
comprehension."
"Hmm." Amber leans forward. "Let me see if I understand you. You are a coalition of individuals from a number of species.
You prefer to use the common user interface model we sent you, and offered us the language module you're using for an
exchange? And you want to trade with us."

"Exchange interest," the Wunch emphasizes, bouncing up and down on its legs. "Can offer much! Sense of identity of a
thousand civilizations. Safe tunnels to a hundred archives on the net suitable for beings who are not untranslatable entity
signifier. Able to control risks of communication. Have technique of manipulating matter at molecular level. Solution to
algorithmic iterated systems based on quantum entanglement."
"Old-fashioned nanotechnology and shiny beads to dazzle the primitives," Pierre mutters on Amber's multicast channel. "How
backward do they think we are?"
"The physics model in here is really overdone," comments Boris. "They may even think this is real, that we're primitives coat-tailing it
on the back of the lobsters' efforts."
Amber forces a smile. "That is most interesting!" she trills at the Wunch's representatives. "I have appointed two
representatives who will negotiate with you; this is an internal contest within my own court. I commend to you Pierre Naqet,
my own commercial representative. In addition, you may want to deal with Alan Glashwiecz, an independent factor who is
not currently present. Others may come forward in due course if that is acceptable."
"It pleases us," says Lobster Number One. "We are tired and disoriented by the long journey through gateways to this place.
Request resumption of negotiations later?"
"By all means." Amber nods. A sergeant-at-arms, a mindless but impressive zimboe controlled by her spider's nest of
personality threads, blows a sharp note on his trumpet. The first audience is at an end.
***
Outside the light cone of the Field Circus, on the other side of the spacelike separation between Amber's little
kingdom in motion and the depths of empire time that grip the solar system's entangled quantum networks,
a singular new reality is taking shape.
Welcome to the moment of maximum change.
About ten billion humans are alive in the solar system, each mind surrounded by an exocortex of
distributed agents, threads of personality spun right out of their heads to run on the clouds of utility fog –
infinitely flexible computing resources as thin as aerogel – in which they live. The foggy depths are alive with
high-bandwidth sparkles; most of Earth's biosphere has been wrapped in cotton wool and preserved for
future examination. For every living human, a thousand million software agents carry information into the
farthest corners of the consciousness address space.
The sun, for so long an unremarkable mildly variable G2 dwarf, has vanished within a gray cloud that
englobes it except for a narrow belt around the plane of the ecliptic. Sunlight falls, unchanged, on the inner
planets: Except for Mercury, which is no longer present, having been dismantled completely and turned into
solar-powered high-temperature nanocomputers. A much fiercer light falls on Venus, now surrounded by
glittering ferns of carbon crystals that pump angular momentum into the barely spinning planet via huge
superconducting loops wound around its equator. This planet, too, is due to be dismantled. Jupiter,
Neptune, Uranus – all sprout rings as impressive as Saturn's. But the task of cannibalizing the gas giants will
take many times longer than the small rocky bodies of the inner system.
The ten billion inhabitants of this radically changed star system remember being human; almost half of them
predate the millennium. Some of them still are human, untouched by the drive of meta-evolution that has
replaced blind Darwinian change with a goal-directed teleological progress. They cower in gated communities
and hill forts, mumbling prayers and cursing the ungodly meddlers with the natural order of things. But
eight out of every ten living humans are included in the phase-change. It's the most inclusive revolution in
the human condition since the discovery of speech.
A million outbreaks of gray goo – runaway nanoreplicator excursions – threaten to raise the temperature of
the biosphere dramatically. They're all contained by the planetary-scale immune system fashioned from what
was once the World Health Organization. Weirder catastrophes threaten the boson factories in the Oort
cloud. Antimatter factories hover over the solar poles. Sol system shows all the symptoms of a runaway
intelligence excursion, exuberant blemishes as normal for a technological civilization as skin problems on a
human adolescent.
The economic map of the planet has changed beyond recognition. Both capitalism and communism, bickering
ideological children of a protoindustrial outlook, are as obsolete as the divine right of kings: Companies are
alive, and dead people may live again, too. Globalism and tribalism have run to completion, diverging
respectively into homogeneous interoperability and the Schwarzschild radius of insularity. Beings that
remember being human plan the deconstruction of Jupiter, the creation of a great simulation space that will
expand the habitat available within the solar system. By converting all the nonstellar mass of the solar system
into processors, they can accommodate as many human-equivalent minds as a civilization with a planet
hosting ten billion humans in orbit around every star in the galaxy.
A more mature version of Amber lives down in the surging chaos of near-Jupiter space; there's an instance of
Pierre, too, although he has relocated light-hours away, near Neptune. Whether she still sometimes thinks of
her relativistic twin, nobody can tell. In a way, it doesn't matter, because by the time the Field Circus returns

to Jupiter orbit, as much subjective time will have elapsed for the fast-thinkers back home as will flash by in
the real universe between this moment and the end of the era of star formation, many billions of years
hence.

"As your theologian, I am telling you that they are not gods."
Amber nods patiently. She watches Sadeq closely.
Sadeq coughs grumpily. "Tell her, Boris."
Boris tilts his chair back and turns it toward the Queen. "He is right, Amber. They are traders, and not clever ones either. Is
hard to get handle on their semiotics while they hide behind the lobster model we uploaded in their direction twenty years
ago, but are certainly not crusties, and are definite not human either. Or transhuman. My guess, they are bunch of dumb
hicks who get hands on toys left behind by much smarter guys. Like the rejectionist factions back home. Imagine they are
waking up one morning and find everyone else is gone to the great upload environment in the sky. Leaving them with the
planet to themselves. What you think they do with whole world, with any gadgets they trip over? Some will smash everything
they come across, but others not so stupid. But they think small. Scavengers, deconstructionists. Their whole economic
outlook are negative-sum game. Go visit aliens to rip them off, take ideas, not expand selves and transcend."
Amber stands up, walks toward the windows at the front of the bridge. In black jeans and chunky sweater, she barely
resembles the feudal queen whose role she plays for tourists. "Taking them on board was a big risk. I'm not happy about it."
"How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?" Sadeq smiles crookedly. "We have an answer. But they may not even
realize they are dancing with us. These are not the gods you were afraid of finding."
"No." Amber sighs. "Not too different from us, though. I mean, we aren't exactly well adapted to this environment, are we?
We tote these body-images along, rely on fake realities that we can map into our human-style senses. We're emulations, not
native AIs. Where's Su Ang?"
"I can find her." Boris frowns.
"I asked her to analyse the alien's arrival times," Amber adds as an afterthought. "They're close – too close. And they showed
up too damn fast when we first tickled the router. I think Aineko's theories are flawed. The real owners of this network we've
plugged into probably use much higher-level protocols to communicate; sapient packets to build effective communications
gateways. This Wunch, they probably lurk in wait for newbies to exploit. Pedophiles hiding outside the school gate. I don't
want to give them that opportunity before we make contact with the real thing!"
"You may have little choice," says Sadeq. "If they are without insight, as you suspect, they may become afraid if you edit their
environment. They may lash out. I doubt they even understand how they created the contaminated metagrammar that they
transmitted back to us. It will be to them just a tool that makes simpleminded aliens more gullible, easier to negotiate with.
Who knows where they got it?"
"A grammatical weapon." Boris spins himself round slowly. "Build propaganda into your translation software if you want to
establish a favorable trading relationship. How cute. Haven't these guys ever heard of Newspeak?"
"Probably not," Amber says slowly, pausing for a moment to spawn spectator threads to run down the book and all three
movie versions of Nineteen Eighty-Four, followed by the sharecropped series of sequel novels. She shivers uncomfortably as
she re-integrates the memories. "Ick. That's not a very nice vision. Reminds me of" – she snaps her fingers, trying to
remember Dad's favorite – "Dilbert."
"Friendly fascism," says Sadeq. "It matters not, whosoever is in charge. I could tell you tales from my parents, of growing up
with a revolution. To never harbor self-doubt is poison for the soul, and these aliens want to inflict their certainties upon
us."
"I think we ought to see how Pierre is doing," Amber says aloud. "I certainly don't want them poisoning him." Grin: "That's
my job."
***
Donna the Journalist is everywhere simultaneously. It's a handy talent: Makes for even-handed news coverage when you can
interview both sides at the same time.
Right now, one of her is in the bar with Alan Glashwiecz, who evidently hasn't realized that he can modulate his ethanol
dehydrogenase levels voluntarily and who is consequently well on the way to getting steaming drunk. Donna is assisting the
process: She finds it fascinating to watch this bitter young man who has lost his youth to a runaway self-enhancement
process.
"I'm a full partner," he says bitterly, "in Glashwiecz and Selves. I'm one of the Selves. We're all partners, but it's only
Glashwiecz Prime who has any clout. The old bastard – if I'd known I'd grow up to become that, I'd have run away to join
some hippie antiglobalist commune instead." He drains his glass, demonstrating his oropharyngeal integrity, snaps his fingers
for a refill. "I just woke up one morning to find I'd been resurrected by my older self. He said he valued my youthful energy

and optimistic outlook, then offered me a minority stake with stock options that would take five years to vest. The bastard."
"Tell me about it," Donna coaxes sympathetically. "Here we are, stranded among idiopathic types, not among them a single
multiplex –"
"Damn straight." Another bottle of Bud appears in Glashwiecz'a hands. "One moment I'm standing in this apartment in Paris
facing total humiliation by a cross-dressing commie asshole called Macx and his slimy French manager bitch, and the next I'm
on the carpet in front of my alter ego's desk and he's offering me a job as junior partner. It's seventeen years later, all the
weird nonsense that guy Macx was getting up to is standard business practice, and there's six of me in the outer office taking
research notes because myself-as-senior-partner doesn't trust anyone else to work with him. It's humiliating, that's what it is."
"Which is why you're here." Donna waits while he takes a deep swig from the bottle.
"Yeah. Better than working for myself, I can tell you – it's not like being self-employed. You know how you sometimes get
distant from your work? It's really bad when you see yourself from the outside with another half gigasecond of experience
and the new-you isn't just distant from the client base, he's distant from the you-you. So I went back to college and crammed
up on artificial intelligence law and ethics, the jurisprudence of uploading, and recursive tort. Then I volunteered to come
out here. He's still handling her account, and I figured –" Glashwiecz shrugged.
"Did any of the delta-yous contest the arrangement?" asks Donna, spawning ghosts to focus in on him from all angles. For a
moment, she wonders if this is wise. Glashwiecz is dangerous – the power he wields over Amber's mother, to twist her arm
into extending his power of attorney, hints at dark secrets. Maybe there's more to her persistent lawsuits than a simple family
feud?
Glashwiecz's face is a study in perspectives. "Oh, one did," he says dismissively: One of Donna's viewports captures the
contemptuous twitch in his cheek. "I left her in my apartment freezer. Figured it'd be a while before anybody noticed. It's not
murder – I'm still here, right? – and I'm not about to claim tort against myself. I think. It'd be a left-recursive lawsuit, anyway,
if I did it to myself."
"The aliens," prompts Donna, "and the trial by combat. What's your take on that?"
Glashwiecz sneers. "Little bitch-queen takes after her father, doesn't she? He's a bastard, too. The competitive selection filter
she's imposed is evil – it'll cripple her society if she leaves it in place for too long, but in the short run, it's a major
advantage. So she wants me to trade for my life, and I don't get to lay my formal claim against her unless I can outperform
her pet day trader, that punk from Marseilles. Yes? What he doesn't know is, I've got an edge. Full disclosure." He lifts his
bottle drunkenly. "Y'see, I know that cat. One that's gotta brown @-sign on its side, right? It used to belong to
queenie-darling's old man, Manfred, the bastard. You'll see. Her Mom, Pamela, Manfred's ex, she's my client in this case. And
she gave me the cat's ackle keys. Access control." (Hic.) "Get ahold of its brains and grab that damn translation layer it stole
from the CETI@home mob. Then I can talk to them straight."
The drunken, future-shocked lawyer is on a roll. "I'll get their shit, and I'll disassemble it. Disassembly is the future of industry,
y'know?"
"Disassembly?" asks the reporter, watching him in disgusted fascination from behind her mask of objectivity.
"Hell, yeah. There's a singularity going on, that implies disequilibrium. An' wherever there's a disequilibrium, someone is
going to get rich disassembling the leftovers. Listen, I once knew this econo–economist, that's what he was. Worked for the
Eurofeds, rubber fetishist. He tole me about this fact'ry near Barcelona. It had a disassembly line running in it. Spensive
servers in boxes'd roll in at one end. Be unpacked. Then workers'd take the cases off, strip the disk drives, memory,
processors, bits'n'guts out. Bag and tag job. Throw the box, what's left, 'cause it wasn't worth dick. Thing is, the manufact'rer
charged so much for parts, it was worth their while to buy whole machines'n'strip them. To bits. And sell the bits. Hell, they
got an enterprise award for ingenuity! All 'cause they knew that disassembly was the wave of the future."
"What happened to the factory?" asks Donna, unable to tear her eyes away.
Glashwiecz waves an empty bottle at the starbow that stretches across the ceiling: "Ah, who gives a fuck? They closedown
round about" (hic) "ten years 'go. Moore's Law topped out, killed the market. But disassembly – production line cannibalism
– it'sa way to go. Take old assets an' bring new life to them. A fully 'preciated fortune." He grins, eyes unfocussed with greed.
"'S'what I'm gonna do to those space lobsters. Learn to talk their language an'll never know what hit 'em."

The tiny starship drifts in high orbit above a turbid brown soup of atmosphere. Deep in the gravity well of Hyundai
+4904/ , it's a speck of dust trapped between two light sources: the brilliant sapphire stare of Amber's propulsion lasers in
-56
Jovian orbit, and the emerald insanity of the router itself, a hypertoroid spun from strange matter.
The bridge of the Field Circus is in constant use at this time, a meeting ground for minds with access to the restricted areas.
Pierre is spending more and more time here, finding it a convenient place to focus his trading campaign and arbitrage
macros. At the same time that Donna is picking the multiplexed lawyer's strategy apart, Pierre is present in neomorphic
form – a quicksilver outline of humanity, six-armed and two-headed, scanning with inhuman speed through tensor maps of
the information traffic density surrounding the router's clump of naked singularities.

There's a flicker in the emptiness at the rear of the bridge, then Su Ang has always been there. She watches Pierre in
contemplative silence for a minute. "Do you have a moment?"
Pierre superimposes himself: One shadowy ghost keeps focused on the front panel, but another instance turns round, crosses
his arms, waits for her to speak.
"I know you're busy –" she begins, then stops. "Is it that important?" she asks.
"It is." Pierre blurs, resynchronizing his instances. "The router – there are four wormholes leading off from it, did you know
that? Each of them is radiating at about 1011 Kelvins, and every wavelength is carrying data connections, multiplexed, with a
protocol stack that's at least eleven layers deep but maybe more – they show signs of self-similarity in the framing headers.
You know how much data that is? It's about 1012 times as much as our high-bandwidth uplink from home. But compared to
what's on the other side of the 'holes –" he shakes his head.
"It's big?"
"It's unimaginably big! These wormholes, they're a low-bandwidth link compared to the minds they're hooking up to." He blurs
in front of her, unable to stay still and unable to look away from the front panel. Excitement or agitation? Su Ang can't tell.
With Pierre, sometimes the two states are indistinguishable. He gets emotional easily. "I think we have the outline of the
answer to the Fermi paradox. Transcendents don't go traveling because they can't get enough bandwidth – trying to migrate
through one of these wormholes would be like trying to download your mind into a fruit fly, if they are what I think they
are – and the slower-than-light route is out, too, because they couldn't take enough computronium along. Unless –"
He's off again. But before he can blur out, Su Ang steps across and lays hands on him. "Pierre. Calm down. Disengage. Empty
yourself."
"I can't!" He really is agitated, she sees. "I've got to figure out the best trading strategy to get Amber off the hook with that
lawsuit, then tell her to get us out of here; being this close to the router is seriously dangerous! The Wunch are the least of
it."
"Stop."
He pauses his multiplicity of presences, converges on a single identity focused on the here and now. "Yes?"
"That's better." She walks round him, slowly. "You've got to learn to deal with stress more appropriately."
"Stress!" Pierre snorts. He shrugs, an impressive gesture with three sets of shoulder blades. "That's something I can turn off
whenever I need to. Side effect of this existence; we're pigs in cyberspace, wallowing in fleshy simulations, but unable to
experience the new environment in the raw. What did you want from me, Ang? Honestly? I'm a busy man, I've got a trading
network to set up."
"We've got a problem with the Wunch right now, even if you think something worse is out there," Ang says patiently. "Boris
thinks they're parasites, negative-sum gamers who stalk newbies like us. Glashwiecz is apparently talking about cutting a deal
with them. Amber's suggestion is that you ignore them completely, cut them out, and talk to anyone else who'll listen."
"Anyone else who'll listen, right," Pierre says heavily. "Any other gems of wisdom to pass on from the throne?"
Ang takes a deep breath. He's infuriating, she realizes. And worst of all, he doesn't realize. Infuriating but cute. "You're
setting up a trading network, yes?" she asks.
"Yes. A standard network of independent companies, instantiated as cellular automata within the Ring Imperium switched
legal service environment." He relaxes slightly. "Each one has access to a compartmentalized chunk of intellectual property
and can call on the corrected parser we got from that cat. They're set up to communicate with a blackboard system – a
souk – and I'm bringing up a link to the router, a multicast link that'll broadcast the souk's existence to anyone who's
listening. Trade ..." his eyebrows furrow. "There are at least two different currency standards in this network, used to buy
quality-of-service precedence and bandwidth. They depreciate with distance, as if the whole concept of money was invented
to promote the development of long-range network links. If I can get in first, when Glashwiecz tries to cut in on the dealing
by offering IP at discounted rates –"
"He's not going to, Pierre," she says as gently as possible. "Listen to what I said: Glashwiecz is going to focus on the Wunch.
He's going to offer them a deal. Amber wants you to ignore them. Got that?"
"Got it." There's a hollow bong! from one of the communication bells. "Hey, that's interesting."
"What is?" She stretches, neck extending snakelike so that she can see the window on underlying reality that's flickered into
existence in the air before him.
"An ack from ..." he pauses, then plucks a neatly reified concept from the screen in front of him and presents it to her in a
silvery caul of light. "... about two hundred light-years away! Someone wants to talk." He smiles. Then the front panel
workstation bong's again. "Hey again. I wonder what that says."
It's the work of a moment to pipe the second message through the translator. Oddly, it doesn't translate at first. Pierre has

to correct for some weird destructive interference in the fake lobster network before it'll spill its guts. "That's interesting," he
says.
"I'll say." Ang lets her neck collapse back to normal. "I'd better go tell Amber."
"You do that," Pierre says worriedly. He makes eye contact with her, but what she's hoping to see in his face just isn't there.
He's wearing his emotions entirely on the surface. "I'm not surprised their translator didn't want to pass that message along."
"It's a deliberately corrupted grammar," Ang murmurs, and bangs out in the direction of Amber's audience chamber; "and
they're actually making threats." The Wunch, it seems, have acquired a very bad reputation somewhere along the line – and
Amber needs to know.
***
Glashwiecz leans toward Lobster Number One, stomach churning. It's only a real-time kilosecond since his bar-room
interview, but in the intervening subjective time, he's abolished a hangover, honed his brief, and decided to act. In the
Tuileries. "You've been lied to," he confides quietly, trusting the privacy ackles that he browbeat Amber's mother into giving
him – access lists that give him a degree of control over the regime within this virtual universe that the cat dragged in.
"Lied? Context rendered horizontal in past, or subjected to grammatical corruption? Linguistic evil?"
"The latter." Glashwiecz enjoys this, even though it forces him to get rather closer to the two-meter-long virtual crustacean
than he'd like. Showing a mark how they've been scammed is always good, especially when you hold the keys to the door of
the cage they're locked inside. "They are not telling you the truth about this system."
"We received assurances," Lobster Number One says clearly. Its mouthparts move ceaselessly – the noise comes from
somewhere inside its head. "You do not share this phenotype. Why?"
"That information will cost you," says Glashwiecz. "I am willing to provide it on credit."
They haggle briefly. An exchange rate in questions is agreed, as is a trust metric to grade the answers by. "Disclose all," insists
the Wunch negotiator.
"There are multiple sentient species on the world we come from," says the lawyer. "The form you wear belongs to only one –
one that wanted to get away from the form I wear, the original conscious tool-creating species. Some of the species today are
artificial, but all of us trade information for self-advantage."
"This is good to know," the lobster assures him. "We like to buy species."
"You buy species?" Glashwiecz cocks his head.
"We have the unbearable yearning to be not-what-we-are," says the lobster. "Novelty, surprise! Flesh rots and wood decays.
We seek the new being-ness of aliens. Give us your somatotype, give us all your thoughts, and we will dream you over."
"I think something might be arranged," Glashwiecz concedes. "So you want to be – no, to lease the rights to temporarily be
human? Why is that?"
"Untranslatable concept #3 means untranslatable concept #4. God told us to."
"Okay, I think I'll just have to take that on trust for now. What is your true form?" he asks.
"Wait and I show you," says the lobster. It begins to shudder.
"What are you doing –"
"Wait." The lobster twitches, writhing slightly, like a portly businessman adjusting his underwear after a heavy business lunch.
Disturbing shapes move, barely visible through the thick chitinous armor. "We want your help," the lobster explains, voice
curiously muffled. "Want to establish direct trade links. Physical emissaries, yes?"
"Yes, that's very good," Glashwiecz agrees excitedly: It's exactly what he's hoped for, the sought-after competitive advantage
that will prove his fitness in Amber's designated trial by corporate combat. "You're going to deal with us directly without
using that shell interface?"
"Agreed." The lobster trails off into muffled silence; little crunching noises trickle out of its carapace. Then Glashwiecz hears
footsteps behind him on the gravel path.
"What are you doing here?" he demands, looking round. It's Pierre, back in standard human form – a sword hangs from his
belt, and there's a big wheel-lock pistol in his hands. "Hey!"
"Step away from the alien, lawyer," Pierre warns, raising the gun.
Glashwiecz glances back at Lobster Number One. It's pulled its front inside the protective shell, and it's writhing now,
rocking from side to side alarmingly. Something inside the shell is turning black, acquiring depth and texture. "I stand on

counsel's privilege," Glashwiecz insists. "Speaking as this alien's attorney, I must protest in the strongest terms –"
Without warning, the lobster lurches forward and rises up on its rear legs. It reaches out with huge claws, chellipeds coated
with spiny hairs, and grabs Glashwiecz by his arms. "Hey!"
Glashwiecz tries to turn away, but the lobster is already looming over him, maxillipeds and maxillae reaching out from its
head. There's a sickening crunch as one of his elbow joints crumbles, humerus shattered by the closing jaws of a chelliped.
He draws breath to scream, then the four small maxillae grip his head and draw it down toward the churning mandibles.
Pierre scurries sideways, trying to find a line of fire on the lobster that doesn't pass through the lawyer's body. The lobster
isn't cooperating. It turns on the spot, clutching Glashwiecz's convulsing body to itself. There's a stench of shit, and blood is
squirting from its mouthparts. Something is very wrong with the biophysics model here, the realism turned up way higher
than normal.
"Merde," whispers Pierre. He fumbles with the bulky trigger, and there's a faint whirring sound but no explosion.
More wet crunching sounds follow as the lobster demolishes the lawyer's face and swallows convulsively, sucking his head and
shoulders all the way into its gastric mill.
Pierre glances at the heavy handgun. "Shit!" he screams. He glances back at the lobster, then turns and runs for the nearest
wall. There are other lobsters loose in the formal garden. "Amber, emergency!" he sends over their private channel. "Hostiles in
the Louvre!"
The lobster that's taken Glashwiecz hunkers down over the body and quivers. Pierre desperately winds the spring on his
gun, too rattled to check that it's loaded. He glances back at the alien intruder. They've sprung the biophysics model, he sends. I
could die in here, he realizes, momentarily shocked. This instance of me could die forever.
The lobster shell sitting in the pool of blood and human wreckage splits in two. A humanoid form begins to uncurl from
within it, pale-skinned and glistening wet: vacant blue eyes flicker from side to side as it stretches and stands upright,
wobbling uncertainty on its two unstable legs. Its mouth opens and a strange gobbling hiss comes forth.
Pierre recognizes her. "What are you doing here?" he yells.
The nude woman turns toward him. She's the spitting image of Amber's mother, except for the chellipeds she has in place of
hands. She hisses "Equity!" and takes a wobbly step toward him, pincers clacking.
Pierre winds the firing handle again. There's a crash of gunpowder and smoke, a blow that nearly sprains his elbow, and the
nude woman's chest erupts in a spray of blood. She snarls at him wordlessly and staggers – then ragged flaps of bloody meat
close together, knitting shut with improbable speed. She resumes her advance.
"I told Amber the Matrix would be more defensible," Pierre snarls, dropping the firearm and drawing his sword as the alien
turns in his direction and raises arms that end in pincers. "We need guns, damit! Lots of guns!"
"Waaant equity," hisses the alien intruder.
"You can't be Pamela Macx," says Pierre, his back to the wall, keeping the sword point before the lobster-woman-thing. "She's
in a nunnery in Armenia or something. You pulled that out of Glashwiecz's memories – he worked for her, didn't he?"
Claws go snicker-snack before his face. "Investment partnership!" screeches the harridan. "Seat on the board! Eat brains for
breakfast!" It lurches sideways, trying to get past his guard.
"I don't fucking believe this," Pierre snarls. The Wunch-creature jumps at just the wrong moment and slides onto the point of
his blade, claws clacking hungrily. Pierre slides away, nearly leaving his skin on the rough bricks of the wall – and what's good
for one is good for all, as the hacked model in force in this reality compels the attacker to groan and collapse.
Pierre pulls the sword out then, nervously glancing over his shoulder, whacks at her neck. The impact jars his arm, but he
keeps hacking until there's blood spraying everywhere, blood on his shirt, blood on his sword, and a round thing sitting on
a stump of savaged neck nearby, jaw working soundlessly in undeath.
He looks at it for a moment, then his stomach rebels and tries to empty itself into the mess. "Where the hell is everybody?" he
broadcasts on the private channel. "Hostiles in the Louvre!"
He straightens up, gasping for breath. He feels alive, frightened and appalled and exhilarated simultaneously. The crackle of
bursting shells on all sides drowns out the birdsong as the Wunch's emissaries adopt a variety of new and supposedly more
lethal forms. "They don't seem to be very clear on how to take over a simulation space," he adds. "Maybe we already are
untranslatable concept number #1 as far as they're concerned."
"Don't worry, I've cut off the incoming connection," sends Su Ang. "This is just a bridgehead force; the invasion packets are being
filtered out."
Blank-eyed men and women in dusty black uniforms are hatching from the lobster shells, stumbling and running around the
grounds of the royal palace like confused Huguenot invaders.

Boris winks into reality behind Pierre. "Which way?" he demands, pulling out an anachronistic but lethal katana.
"Over here. Let's work this together." Pierre jacks his emotional damper up to a dangerously high setting, suppressing natural
aversion reflexes and temporarily turning himself into a sociopathic killer. He stalks toward an infant lobster-thing with big
black eyes and a covering of white hair that mewls at him from a rose bed, and Boris looks away while he kills it. Then one of
the larger ones makes the mistake of lunging at Boris, and he chops at it reflexively.
Some of the Wunch try to fight back when Pierre and Boris try to kill them, but they're handicapped by their anatomy, a
curious mixture of crustacean and human, claw and mandible against sword and dagger. When they bleed the ground soaks
with the cuprous hue of lobster juice.
"Let's fork," suggests Boris. "Get this over with." Pierre nods, dully – everything around him is wrapped in a layer of
don't-care, except for a glowing dot of artificial hatred – and they fork, multiplying their state vectors to take full advantage
of the virtualization facilities of this universe. There's no need for reinforcements; the Wunch focused on attacking the
biophysics model of the universe, making it mimic a physical reality as closely as possible, and paid no attention to learning
the more intricate tactics that war in a virtual space permits.
Presently Pierre finds himself in the audience chamber, face and hands and clothing caked in hideous gore, leaning on the
back of Amber's throne. There's only one of him now. One of Boris – the only one? – is standing near the doorway. He can
barely remember what has happened, the horrors of parallel instances of mass murder blocked from his long-term memory
by a high-pass trauma filter. "It looks clear," he calls aloud. "What shall we do now?"
"Wait for Catherine de Médicis to show up," says the cat, its grin materializing before him like a numinous threat. "Amber
always finds a way to blame her mother. Or didn't you already know that?"
Pierre glances at the bloody mess on the footpath outside where the first lobster-woman attacked Glashwiecz. "I already did
for her, I think." He remembers the action in the third person, all subjectivity edited out. "The family resemblance was
striking," the thread that still remembers her in working memory murmurs: "I just hope it's only skin-deep." Then he forgets
the act of apparent murder forever. "Tell the Queen I'm ready to talk."

Welcome to the downslope on the far side of the curve of accelerating progress.
Back in the solar system, Earth orbits through a dusty tunnel in space. Sunlight still reaches the birth world,
but much of the rest of the star's output has been trapped by the growing concentric shells of
computronium built from the wreckage of the innermost planets.
Two billion or so mostly unmodified humans scramble in the wreckage of the phase transition, not
understanding why the vasty superculture they so resented has fallen quiet. Little information leaks through
their fundamentalist firewalls, but what there is shows a disquieting picture of a society where there are no
bodies anymore. Utility foglets blown on the wind form aerogel towers larger than cyclones, removing the last
traces of physical human civilization from most of Europe and the North American coastlines. Enclaves
huddle behind their walls and wonder at the monsters and portents roaming the desert of postindustrial
civilization, mistaking acceleration for collapse.
The hazy shells of computronium that ring the sun – concentric clouds of nanocomputers the size of rice
grains, powered by sunlight, orbiting in shells like the packed layers of a Matrioshka doll – are still immature,
holding barely a thousandth of the physical planetary mass of the system, but they already support a classical
computational density of 1042 MIPS; enough to support a billion civilizations as complex as the one that
existed immediately before the great disassembly. The conversion hasn't yet reached the gas giants, and some
scant outer-system enclaves remain independent – Amber's Ring Imperium still exists as a separate entity, and
will do so for some years to come – but the inner solar system planets, with the exception of Earth, have
been colonized more thoroughly than any dusty NASA proposal from the dawn of the space age could have
envisaged.
From outside the Accelerated civilization, it isn't really possible to know what's going on inside. The problem
is bandwidth: While it's possible to send data in and get data out, the sheer amount of computation going on
in the virtual spaces of the Acceleration dwarfs any external observer. Inside that swarm, minds a trillion or
more times as complex as humanity think thoughts as far beyond human imagination as a microprocessor is
beyond a nematode worm. A million random human civilizations flourish in worldscapes tucked in the
corner of this world-mind. Death is abolished, life is triumphant. A thousand ideologies flower, human nature
adapted where necessary to make this possible. Ecologies of thought are forming in a Cambrian explosion of
ideas: For the solar system is finally rising to consciousness, and mind is no longer restricted to the mere
kilotons of gray fatty meat harbored in fragile human skulls.
Somewhere in the Acceleration, colorless green ideas adrift in furious sleep remember a tiny starship
launched years ago, and pay attention. Soon, they realize, the starship will be in position to act as their
proxy in an ages-long conversation. Negotiations for access to Amber's extrasolar asset commence; the Ring
Imperium prospers, at least for a while.
But first, the operating software on the human side of the network link will require an upgrade.

The audience chamber in the Field Circus is crammed. Everybody aboard the ship – except the still-frozen lawyer and the
alien barbarian intruders – is present. They've just finished reviewing the recordings of what happened in the Tuileries, of
Glashwiecz's fatal last conversation with the Wunch, the resulting fight for survival. And now the time has come for decisions.
"I'm not saying you have to follow me," says Amber, addressing her court; "just, it's what we came here for. We've established
that there's enough bandwidth to transmit people and their necessary support VMs; we've got some basic expectancy of
goodwill at the other end, or at least an agalmic willingness to gift us with advice about the untrustworthiness of the Wunch.I
propose to copy myself through and see what's at the other side of the wormhole. What's more, I'm going to suspend myself
on this side and hand over to whichever instance of me comes back, unless there's a long hiatus. How long, I haven't decided
yet. Are you guys happy to join me?"
Pierre stands behind her throne, hands on the back. Looking down over her head, at the cat in her lap, he's sure he sees it
narrow its eyes at him. Funny, he thinks, we're talking about jumping down a rabbit hole and trusting whoever lives at the other end
with our personalities. After seeing the Wunch. Does this make sense?
"Forgive, please, but am not stupid," says Boris. "This is Fermi paradox territory, no? Instantaneous network exists, is
traversable, with bandwidth adequate for human-equivalent minds. Where are alien visitors, in history? Must be overriding
reason for absence. Think will wait here and see what comes back. Then make up mind to drink the poison kool-aid."
"I've got half a mind to transmit myself through without a back-up," says someone else – "but that's okay; half a mind is all
we've got the bandwidth for." Halfhearted laughter shores up his wisecrack, supports a flagging determination to press
through.
"I'm with Boris," says Su Ang. She glances at Pierre, catches his eye: Suddenly a number of things become clear to him. He
shakes his head minutely. You never had a chance – I belong to Amber, he thinks, but deletes the thought before he can send it
to her. Maybe in another instantiation his issues with the Queen's droit de seigneur would have bulked up larger, splintered
his determination; maybe in another world it has already happened? "I think this is very rash," she says in a hurry. "We don't
know enough about post-singularity civilizations."
"It's not a singularity," Amber says waspishly. "It's just a brief burst of acceleration. Like cosmological inflation."
"Smooths out inhomogeneities in the initial structure of consciousness," purrs the cat. "Don't I get a vote?"
"You do." Amber sighs. She glances round. "Pierre?"
Heart in his mouth: "I'm with you."
She smiles, brilliantly. "Well then. Will the nay sayers please leave the universe?"
Suddenly, the audience chamber is half-empty.
"I'm setting a watchdog timer for a billion seconds into the future, to restart us from this point if the router doesn't send
anyone back in the intervening time," she announces gravely, taking in the serious-faced avatars of those who remain.
Surprised: "Sadeq! I didn't think this was your type of –"
He doesn't smile: "Would I be true to my faith if I wasn't prepared to bring the words of Mohammed, peace be unto him, to
those who may never have heard his name?"
Amber nods. "I guess."
"Do it," Pierre says urgently. "You can't keep putting it off forever."
Aineko raises her head: "Spoilsport!"
"Okay." Amber nods. "Let's do –"
She punches an imaginary switch, and time stops.

since darkened. Ancient starlight picks out the outline of a huge planetlike body beneath the jewel-and-cobweb corpse of the
starwisp.
Eight Earth years have passed since the good ship Field Circus slipped into close orbit around the frigid brown dwarf Hyundai
+4904/ . Five years have gone by since the launch lasers of the Ring Imperium shut down without warning, stranding the
-56
light-sail-powered craft three light-years from home. There has been no response from the router, the strange alien artifact
in orbit around the brown dwarf, since the crew of the starwisp uploaded themselves through its strange quantum
entanglement interface for transmission to whatever alien network it connects to. In fact, nothing happens; nothing save the
slow trickle of seconds, as a watchdog timer counts down the moments remaining until it is due to resurrect stored
snapshots of the crew, on the assumption that their uploaded copies are beyond help.
Meanwhile, outside the light cone –
***
Amber jolts into wakefulness, as if from a nightmare. She sits bolt upright, a thin sheet falling from her chest; air circulating
around her back chills her rapidly, cold sweat evaporating. She mutters aloud, unable to subvocalize, "Where am I – oh. A
bedroom. How did I get here?" Mumble. "Oh, I see." Her eyes widen in horror. "It's not a dream ..."
"Greetings, human Amber," says a ghost-voice that seems to come from nowhere: "I see you are awake. Would you like
anything?"
Amber rubs her eyes tiredly. Leaning against the bedstead, she glances around cautiously. She takes in a bedside mirror, her
reflection in it: a young woman, gaunt in the manner of those whose genome bears the p53 calorie-restriction hack, she has
disheveled blonde hair and dark eyes. She could pass for a dancer or a soldier; not, perhaps, a queen. "What's going on?
Where am I? Who are you, and what am I doing in your head?"
Her eyes narrow. Analytical intellect comes to the fore as she takes stock of her surroundings. "The router," she mutters.
Structures of strange matter orbit a brown dwarf scant light-years from Earth. "How long ago did we come through?"
Glancing round, she sees a room walled in slabs of close-fitting stone. A window bay is recessed into them, after the style of
the Crusader castles many centuries in the past, but there's no glass in it – just a blank white screen. The only furniture in
the room, besides a Persian carpet on the cold flagstones, is the bed she sits upon. She's reminded of a scene from an old
movie, Kubrick's enigma; this whole set-up has got to be deliberate, and it isn't funny.
"I'm waiting," she announces, and leans back against the headboard.
"According to our records this reaction indicates that you are now fully self-aware," says the ghost. "This is good. You have
not been conscious for a very long time. Explanations will be complex and discursive. Can I offer you refreshments? What
would you like?"
"Coffee, if you have it. Bread and hummus. Something to wear." Amber crosses her arms, abruptly self-conscious. "I'd prefer
to have management ackles to this universe, though. As realities go, it's a bit lacking in creature comforts." Which isn't
entirely true – it seems to have a comprehensive, human-friendly biophysics model, it's not just a jumped-up first-person
shooter. Her eyes focus on her left forearm, where tanned skin and a puckered dime of scar tissue record a youthful
accident with a pressure seal in Jovian orbit. Amber freezes for a moment. Her lips move in silence, but she's locked into
place in this universe, unable to split or conjoin nested realities just by calling subroutines that have been spliced into the
corners of her mind since she was a teenager. Finally, she asks, "How long have I been dead?"
"Longer than you were alive, by orders of magnitude," says the ghost. A tray laden with pita breads, hummus, and olives
congeals from the air above her bed, and a wardrobe appears at one side of the room. "I can begin the explanation now or
wait for you to finish eating. Which would you prefer?"
Amber glances about again, then fixes on the white screen in the window bay. "Give it to me right now. I can take it," she
says, quietly bitter. "I like to understand my mistakes as soon as possible."
"We-us can tell that you are a human of determination," says the ghost, a hint of pride entering its voice. "That is a good
thing, Amber. You will need all of your resolve if you are going to survive here ..."
***
It is the time of repentance in a temple beside a tower that looms above a dry plain, and the thoughts of the priest who lives
in the tower are tinged with regret. It is Ashura, the tenth day of Muhurram, according to a real-time clock still tuned to the
pace of a different era: the one thousand, three hundred and fortieth anniversary of the martyrdom of the Third Imam, the
Sayyid ash-Shuhada.
The priest of the tower has spent an indefinite time in prayer, locked in an eternal moment of meditation and recitation.
Now, as the vast red sun drifts close to the horizon of the infinite desert, his thoughts drift toward the present. Ashura is a
very special day, a day of atonement for collective guilt, evil committed through inactivity; but it is in Sadeq's nature to look
outwards toward the future. This is, he knows, a failing – but also characteristic of his generation. That's the generation of
the Shi'ite clergy that reacted to the excesses of the previous century, the generation that withdrew the ulama from temporal
power, retreated from the velyat i-faqih of Khomenei and his successors, left government to the people, and began to engage
fully with the paradoxes of modernity. Sadeq's focus, his driving obsession in theology, is a program of reappraisal of

eschatology and cosmology. Here in a tower of white sun-baked clay, on an endless plain that exists only in the imaginary
spaces of a starship the size of a soft drink can, the priest spends his processor cycles in contemplation of one of the most
vicious problems ever to confront a mujtahid – the Fermi paradox.
(Enrico Fermi was eating his lunch one day, and his colleagues were discussing the possibility that sophisticated civilizations
might populate other worlds. "Yes," he said, "but if this is so, why haven't they already come visiting?")
Sadeq finishes his evening devotions in near silence, then stands, stretches as is his wont, and leaves the small and lonely
courtyard at the base of the tower. The gate – a wrought-iron gate, warmed by sunlight – squeals slightly as he opens it.
Glancing at the upper hinge, he frowns, willing it clean and whole. The underlying physics model acknowledges his access
controls: a thin rim of red around the pin turns silvery-fresh, and the squeaking ceases. Closing the gate behind him, Sadeq
enters the tower.
He climbs with a heavy, even tread a spiral staircase snaking ever upward above him. Narrow slit-windows line the outer wall
of the staircase. Through each of them he sees a different world. Out there, nightfall in the month of Ramadan. And through
the next, green misty skies and a horizon too close by far. Sadeq carefully avoids thinking about the implications of this
manifold space. Coming from prayer, from a sense of the sacred, he doesn't want to lose his proximity to his faith. He's far
enough from home as it is, and there is much to consider. He is surrounded by strange and curious ideas, all but lost in a
corrosive desert of faith.
At the top of the staircase, Sadeq comes to a door of aged wood bound in iron. It doesn't belong here: It's a cultural and
architectural anomaly. The handle is a loop of black metal. Sadeq regards it as if it's the head of an asp, poised to sting.
Nevertheless, he reaches out and turns the handle, steps across the threshold into a palace out of fantasy.
None of this is real, he reminds himself. It's no more real than an illusion conjured by one of the jinni of the thousand nights and one
night. Nevertheless, he can't save himself from smiling at the scene – a sardonic smile of self-deprecating humor, tempered by
frustration.
Sadeq's captors have stolen his soul and locked it – him – in a very strange prison, a temple with a tower that rises all the
way to Paradise. It's the whole classical litany of medievalist desires, distilled from fifteen hundred years of literature.
Colonnaded courtyards, cool pools lined with rich mosaics, rooms filled with every imaginable dumb matter luxury, endless
banquets awaiting his appetite – and dozens of beautiful un-women, eager to fulfill his every fantasy. Sadeq, being human, has
fantasies by the dozen, but he doesn't dare permit himself to succumb to temptation. I'm not dead, he reasons. Therefore, how
can I be in Paradise? Therefore, this must be a false paradise, a temptation sent to lead me astray. Probably. Unless I am dead, because
Allah, peace be unto him, considers a human soul separated from its body to be dead. But if that's so, isn't uploading a sin? In which
case, this can't be Paradise because I am a sinner. Besides which, this whole setup is so puerile!
Sadeq has always been inclined to philosophical inquiry, and his vision of the afterlife is more cerebral than most, involving
ideas as questionable within the framework of Islam as those of Teilhard de Chardin were to the twentieth-century Catholic
church. If there's one key indicator of a false paradise in his eschatology, it's two-and-seventy brainlessly beautiful houris
waiting to do his bidding. So it follows that he can't really be dead ...
The whole question of reality is so vexing that Sadeq does what he does every night. He strides heedlessly across priceless
works of art, barging hastily through courtyards and passageways, ignoring niches in which nearly naked supermodels lie with
their legs apart, climbing stairs – until he comes to a small unfurnished room with a single high window in one wall. There he
sits on the floor, legs crossed, meditating; not in prayer, but in a more tightly focused ratiocination. Every false night (for
there is no way to know how fast time is passing, outside this cyberspace pocket), Sadeq sits and thinks, grappling with
Descartes's demon in the solitude of his own mind. And the question he asks himself every night is the same: Can I tell if this is
the true hell? And if it is not, how can I escape?

The ghost tells Amber that she has been dead for just under a third of a million years. She has been reinstantiated from
storage – and has died again – many times in the intervening period, but she has no memory of this; she is a fork from the
main bough, and the other branches expired in lonely isolation.
The business of resurrection does not, in and of itself, distress Amber unduly. Born in the post-Moravec era, she merely finds
some aspects of the ghost's description dissatisfyingly incomplete. It's like saying she was drugged and brought hither without
stating whether by plane, train, or automobile.
She doesn't have a problem with the ghost's assertion that she is nowhere near Earth – indeed, that she is approximately
eighty thousand light-years away. When she and the others took the risk of uploading themselves through the router they
found in orbit around Hyundai +4904/ -56 they'd understood that they could end up anywhere or nowhere. But the idea
that she's still within the light cone of her departure strikes her as dubious. The original SETI broadcast strongly implied that
the router is part of a network of self-replicating instantaneous communicators, spawning and spreading between the cold
brown dwarf stars that litter the galaxy. She'd somehow expected to be much farther from home by now.
Somewhat more disturbing is the ghost's assertion that the human genotype has rendered itself extinct at least twice, that its
home planet is unknown, and that Amber is nearly the only human left in the public archives. At this point, she interrupts. "I
hardly see what this has to do with me!" Then she blows across her coffee glass, trying to cool the contents. "I'm dead," she
explains, with an undertone of knowing sarcasm in her voice. "Remember? I just got here. A thousand seconds ago, subjective

time, I was in the control node of a starship, discussing what to do with the router we were in orbit around. We agreed to
send ourselves through it, as a trade mission. Then I woke up in bed here in the umpty-zillionth century, wherever and
whatever here is. Without access to any reality ackles or augmentation, I can't even tell whether this is real or an embedded
simulation. You're going to have to explain why you need an old version of me before I can make sense of my situation – and
I can tell you, I'm not going to help you until I know who you are. And speaking of that, what about the others? Where are
they? I wasn't the only one, you know?"
The ghost freezes in place for a moment, and Amber feels a watery rush of terror: Have I gone too far? she wonders.
"There has been an unfortunate accident," the ghost announces portentously. It morphs from a translucent copy of Amber's
own body into the outline of a human skeleton, elaborate bony extensions simulating an osteosarcoma of more-than-lethal
proportions. "Consensus-we believe that you are best positioned to remediate the situation. This applies within the
demilitarized zone."
"Demilitarized?" Amber shakes her head, pauses to sip her coffee. "What do you mean? What is this place?"
The ghost flickers again, adopting an abstract rotating hypercube as its avatar. "This space we occupy is a manifold adjacent
to the demilitarized zone. The demilitarized zone is a space outside our core reality, itself exposed to entities that cross freely
through our firewall, journeying to and from the network outside. We-us use the DMZ to establish the informational value
of migrant entities, sapient currency units and the like. We-us banked you upon arrival against future options trades in
human species futures."
"Currency!" Amber doesn't know whether to be amused or horrified – both reactions seem appropriate. "Is that how you
treat all your visitors?"
The ghost ignores her question. "There is a runaway semiotic excursion under way in the zone. We-us believe only you can
fix it. If you agree to do, so we will exchange value, pay, reward cooperation, expedite remuneration, manumit, repatriate."
Amber drains her coffee cup. "Have you ever entered into economic interactions with me, or humans like me, before?" she
asks. "If not, why should I trust you? If so, why have you revived me? Are there any more experienced instances of myself
running around here?" She raises a skeptical eyebrow at the ghost. "This looks like the start of an abusive relationship."
The ghost continues to sidestep her attempts to work out where she stands. It flickers into transparency, grows into a hazy
window on a landscape of impossible shapes. Clouds sprouting trees drift above a landscape of green, egg-curved hills and
cheesecake castles. "Nature of excursion: alien intelligence is loose in the DMZ," it asserts. "Alien is applying invalid semiotics
to complex structures designed to sustain trade. You know this alien, Amber. We require solution. Slay the monster, we will
give you line of credit. Your own reality to control, insight into trade arrangements, augmented senses, ability to travel. Can
even upgrade you to you-we consensus, if desired."
"This monster." Amber leans forward, staring into the window eagerly. She's half-minded to ignore what she feels is a
spurious offer; it doesn't sound too appetizing. Upgrade me to a ghost fragment of an alien group mind? she wonders dismissively.
"What is this alien?" She feels blind and unsure, stripped of her ability to spawn threads of herself to pursue complex
inferences. "Is it part of the Wunch?"
"Datum unknown. It-them came with you," says the ghost. "Accidentally reactivated some seconds since now. It runs amok in
the demilitarized zone. Help us, Amber. Save our hub, or we will be cut off from the network. If that happens, you will die
with we-us. Save us ..."

A single memory belonging to someone else unwinds, faster than a guided missile and far more deadly.
Amber, aged eleven, is a gawky, long-limbed child loose on the streets of Hong Kong, a yokel tourist viewing
the hot core of the Middle Kingdom. This is her first and final vacation before the Franklin Trust straps her
inside the payload pod of a Shenzhou spaceplane and blasts her into orbit from Xinkiang. She's free for the
time being, albeit mortgaged to the tune of several million euros; she's a little taikonaut to be, ready to work
for the long years in Jupiter orbit it will take her to pay off the self-propelled options web that owns her. It's
not exactly slavery: Thanks to Dad's corporate shell game she doesn't have to worry about Mom chasing her,
trying to return her to the posthuman prison of growing up just like an old-fashioned little girl. And now
she's got a bit of pocket money, and a room in the Hilton, and her own personal Franklin remote to keep
her company, she's decided she's gonna do that eighteenth-century-enlightenment tourist shit and do it right.
Because this is her last day at liberty in the randomly evolved biosphere.
China is where things are at in this decade, hot and dense and full of draconian punishments for the
obsolescent. Nationalist fervor to catch up with the west has been replaced by consumerist fervor to own
the latest fad gadgets; the most picturesque tourist souvenirs from the quaintly old-fashioned streets of

noise. Geodesic domes sprout like skeletal mushrooms from the glass-and-chrome roofs of the expensive
shopping malls and luxury hotels, threatening to float away on the hot sea breeze. There are no airliners
roaring in and out of Kai Tak anymore, no burnished aluminum storm clouds to rain round-eyed passengers
on the shopping malls and fish markets of Kowloon and the New Territories. In these tense later days of the
War Against Unreason, impossible new shapes move in the sky; Amber gapes upward as a Shenyang F-30
climbs at a near-vertical angle, a mess of incomprehensibly curved flight surfaces vanishing to a perspective
point that defies radar as well as eyeballs. The Chinese – fighter? missile platform? supercomputer? – is
heading out over the South China Sea to join the endless patrol that reassures the capitalist world that it is
being guarded from the Hosts of Denial, the Trouble out of Wa'hab.
For the moment, she's merely a precocious human child. Amber's subconscious is off-lined by the presence of
forceful infowar daemons, the Chinese government censorbots suppressing her cognition of their deadliest
weapons. And in the seconds while her mind is as empty as a sucked egg, a thin-faced man with blue hair
shoves her in the small of her back and snatches at her shoulder bag.
"Hey!" she yells, stumbling. Her mind's a blur, optics refusing to respond and grab a biometric model of her
assailant. It's the frozen moment, the dead zone when on-line coverage fails, and the thief is running away
before she can catch her balance or try to give chase. Plus, with her extensions off-line she doesn't know
how to yell "stop, thief!" in Cantonese.
Seconds later, the fighter is out of visual range and the state censorship field lets up. "Get him, you bastards!"
she screams, but the curious shoppers simply stare at the rude foreign child: An elderly woman brandishes a
disposable phonecam at her and screeches something back. Amber picks up her feet and runs. Already she
can feel the subsonics from her luggage growling at her guts – it's going to make a scene if she doesn't catch
up in time. Shoppers scatter, a woman with a baby carriage almost running her down in her panic to get
away from it.
By the time Amber reaches her terrified shoulder bag, the thief has disappeared: She has to spend almost a
minute petting the scared luggage before it stops screeching and retracts its spines enough for her to pick it
up. And by that time there's a robocop in attendance. "Identify yourself," it rasps in synthetic English.
Amber stares at her bag in horror: There's a huge gash in the side, and it's far too light. It's gone, she thinks,
despairingly. He stole it. "Help," she says faintly, holding up her bag for the distant policeman looking through
the robot's eyes. "Been stolen."
"What item missing?" asks the robot.
"My Hello Kitty," she says, batting her eyelashes, mendacity full-on at maximum utilization, prodding her
conscience into submission, warning of dire consequences should the police discover the true nature of her
pet cat. "My kitten's been stolen! Can you help me?"
"Certainly," says the cop, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder – a hand that turns into a steel
armband, as it pushes her into a van and notifies her in formally stilted language that she is under arrest on
suspicion of shoplifting and will be required to produce certificates of authenticity and a fully compliant
ownership audit for all items in her possession if she wants to prove her innocence.
By the time Amber's meatbrain realizes that she is being politely arrested, some of her external threads have
already started yelling for help and her m-commerce trackers have identified the station she's being taken to
by way of click-thru trails and an obliging software license manager. They spawn agents to go notify the
Franklin trustees, Amnesty International, the Space and Freedom Party, and her father's lawyers. As she's
being booked into a cerise-and-turquoise juvenile offenders holding room by a middle-aged policewoman, the
phones on the front desk are already ringing with inquiries from attorneys, fast-food vendors, and a
particularly on-the-ball celebrity magazine that's been tracking her father's connections. "Can you help me
get my cat back?" she asks the policewoman earnestly.
"Name," the officer reads, eyes flickering from the simultaneous translation. "To please wax your identity
stiffly."
"My cat has been stolen," Amber insists.
"Your cat?" The cop looks perplexed, then exasperated. Dealing with foreign teenagers who answer questions
with gibberish isn't in her repertoire. "We are asking your name?"
"No," says Amber. "It's my cat. It has been stolen. My cat has been stolen."
"Aha! Your papers, please?"
"Papers?" Amber is growing increasingly worried. She can't feel the outside world; there's a Faraday cage
wrapped around the holding cell, and it's claustrophobically quiet inside. "I want my cat! Now!"
The cop snaps her fingers, then reaches into her own pocket and produces an ID card, which she points to
insistently. "Papers," she repeats. "Or else."

"I don't know what you're talking about!" Amber wails.
The cop stares at her oddly. "Wait." She rises and leaves, and a minute later, returns with a thin-faced man in
a business suit and wire-rimmed glasses that glow faintly.
"You are making a scene," he says, rudely and abruptly. "What is your name? Tell me truthfully, or you'll
spend the night here."
Amber bursts into tears. "My cat's been stolen," she chokes out.
The detective and the cop obviously don't know how to deal with this scene; it's freaking them out, with its
overtones of emotional messiness and sinister diplomatic entanglement. "You wait here," they say, and back
out of the cell, leaving her alone with a plastic animatronic koala and a cheap Lebanese coffee machine.
The implications of her loss – of Aineko's abduction – are sinking in, finally, and Amber is weeping loudly and
hopelessly. It's hard to deal with bereavement and betrayal at any age, and the cat has been her wisecracking
companion and consolation for a year, the rock of certainty that gave her the strength to break free from
her crazy mother. To lose her cat to a body shop in Hong Kong, where she will probably be cut up for
spare circuitry or turned into soup is too horrible to contemplate. Filled with despair and hopeless anguish,
Amber howls at the interrogation room walls while outside, trapped threads of her consciousness search for
backups to synchronize with.
But after an hour, just as she's quieting down into a slough of raw despair, there's a knock – a knock! – at
the door. An inquisitive head pops in. "Please to come with us?" It's the female cop with the bad
translationware. She takes in Amber's sobbing and tuts under her breath, but as Amber stands up and
shambles toward her, she pulls back.
At the front desk of a cubicle farm full of police bureaucrats in various states of telepresence, the detective is
waiting with a damp cardboard box wrapped in twine. "Please identify," he asks, snipping the string.
Amber shakes her head, dizzy with the flow of threads homing in to synchronize their memories with her. "Is
it –" she begins to ask as the lid comes apart, wet pulp disintegrating. A triangular head pops up, curiously,
sniffing the air. Bubbles blow from brown-furred nostrils. "What took you so long?" asks the cat, as she
reaches into the box and picks her up, fur wet and matted with seawater.

"If you want me to go fix your alien, for starters I want you to give me reality alteration privileges," says Amber. "Then I want
you to find the latest instances of everyone who came here with me – round up the usual suspects – and give them root
privileges, too. Then we'll want access to the other embedded universes in the DMZ. Finally, I want guns. Lots of guns."
"That may be difficult," says the ghost. "Many other humans reached halting state long since. Is at least one other still alive,
but not accessible for duration of eschatological experiment in progress. Not all were recorded with version control engine;
others were-is lost in DMZ. We-are can provide you with extreme access to the demilitarized zone, but query the need for
kinetic energy weapons."
Amber sighs. "You guys really are media illiterates, aren't you?" She stands up and stretches, feeling a facsimile of sleep's
enervation leaching from her muscles. "I'll also need my –" it's on the tip of her tongue: There's something missing. "Hang on.
There's something I've forgotten." Something important, she thinks, puzzled. Something that used to be around all the time that
would ... know? ... purr? ... help? "Never mind," she hears her lips say. "This other human. I really want her. Non-negotiable. All
right?"
"That may be difficult," repeats the ghost. "Entity is looping in a recursively confined universe."
"Eh?" Amber blinks at it. "Would you mind rephrasing that? Or illustrating?"
"Illustration:" The ghost folds the air in the room into a glowing ball of plasma, shaped like a Klein bottle. Amber's eyes cross
as she looks at it. "Closest reference from human historical database is Descartes's demon. This entity has retreated within a
closed space, but is now unsure whether it is objectively real or not. In any event, it refuses to interact."
"Well, can you get me into that space?" asks Amber. Pocket universes she can deal with; it's part and parcel of her life. "Give
me some leverage –"
"Risk may attach to this course of action," warns the ghost.
"I don't care," she says irritably. "Just put me there. It's someone I know, isn't it? Send me into her dream, and I'll wake her
up, okay?"
"Understood," says the ghost. "Prepare yourself."
Without any warning, Amber is somewhere else. She glances around, taking in an ornate mosaic floor, whitewashed walls set
with open windows through which stars twinkle faintly in the night sky. Her clothing has somehow been replaced by sexy
lingerie under a nearly transparent robe, and her hair's grown longer by about half a meter. It's all very disorienting. The

walls are stone, and she stands in a doorway to a room with nothing in it but a bed. Occupied by –
"Shit," she exclaims. "Who are you?" The young and incredibly, classically beautiful woman in the bed looks at her vacantly,
then rolls over on her side. She isn't wearing a stitch, she's completely hairless from the ears down, and her languid posture
is one of invitation. "Yes?" Amber asks. "What is it?"
The woman on the bed beckons to her slowly. Amber shakes her head. "Sorry, that's just not my scene." She backs away into
the corridor, unsteady in unaccustomedly high heels. "This is some sort of male fantasy, isn't it? And a dumb adolescent one
at that." She looks around again. In one direction, a corridor heads past more open doorways, and in the other, it ends with
a spiral staircase. Amber concentrates, trying to tell the universe to take her to the logical destination, but nothing happens.
"Looks like I'm going to have to do this the hard way. I wish –" she frowns. She was about to wish that someone else was here,
but she can't remember who. So she takes a deep breath and heads toward the staircase.
"Up or down?" she asks herself. Up – it seems logical, if you're going to have a tower, to sleep up at the top of it. So she
climbs the steps carefully, holding the spiraling rail. I wonder who designed this space? she wonders, and what role am I supposed
to fit into in their scenario? On second thoughts, the latter question strikes her as laughable. Wait till I give him an earful ...
There's a plain wooden door at the top of the staircase, with a latch that isn't fastened. Amber pauses for a few seconds,
nerving herself to confront a sleeper so wrapped in solipsism that he's built this sex-fantasy castle around himself. I hope it
isn't Pierre, she thinks grimly as she pushes the door inward.
The room is bare and floored in wood. There's no furniture, just an open window set high in one wall. A man sits
cross-legged and robed, with his back to her, mumbling quietly to himself and nodding slightly. Her breath catches as she
realizes who it is. Oh shit! Her eyes widen. Is this what's been inside his head all along?
"I did not summon you," Sadeq says calmly, not turning round to look at her. "Go away, tempter. You aren't real."
Amber clears her throat. "Sorry to disappoint you, but you're wrong," she says. "We've got an alien monster to catch. Want
to come hunting?"
Sadeq stops nodding. He sits up slowly, stretching his spine, then stands up and turns round. His eyes glint in the moonlight.
"That's odd." He undresses her with his gaze. "You look like someone I used to know. You've never done that before."
"For fuck's sake!" Amber nearly explodes, but catches herself after a moment. "What is this, a Solipsists United chapterhouse
meeting?"
"I –" Sadeq looks puzzled. "I'm sorry, are you claiming to be real?"
"As real as you are." Amber reaches out and grabs a hand: He doesn't resist as she pulls him toward the doorway.
"You're the first visitor I've ever had." He sounds shocked.
"Listen, come on." She tugs him after her, down the spiral staircase to the floor below. "Do you want to stay here? Really?"
She glances back at him. "What is this place?"
"Hell is a perversion of heaven," he says slowly, running the fingers of his free hand through his beard. Abruptly, he reaches
out and grabs her around the waist, then yanks her toward him. "We'll have to see how real you are –" Amber, who is not
used to this kind of treatment, responds by stomping on his instep and backhanding him hard.
"You're real!" he cries, as he falls back against the staircase. "Forgive me, please! I had to know –"
"Know what?" she snarls. "Lay one finger on me again, and I'll leave you here to rot!" She's already spawning the ghost that
will signal the alien outside to pull her out of this pocket universe: It's a serious threat.
"But I had to – wait. You have free will. You just demonstrated that." He's breathing heavily and looking up at her
imploringly. "I'm sorry, I apologize! But I had to know whether you were another zombie. Or not."
"A zombie?" She looks round. Another living doll has appeared behind her, standing in an open doorway wearing a skintight
leather suit with a cutaway crotch. She beckons to Sadeq invitingly. Another body wearing strategically placed strips of
rubber mewls at her feet, writhing for attention. Amber raises an eyebrow in disgust. "You thought I was one of those?"
Sadeq nods. "They've got cleverer lately. Some of them can talk. I nearly mistook one for –" He shudders convulsively.
"Unclean!"
"Unclean." Amber looks down at him thoughtfully. "This isn't really your personal paradise after all, is it?" After a moment she
holds out a hand to him. "Come on."
"I'm sorry I thought you were a zombie," he repeats.
"Under the circumstances, I think I forgive you," she says. Then the ghost yanks them both back to the universe outside.

More memories converge on the present moment:
The Ring Imperium is a huge cluster of self-replicating robots that Amber has assembled in low Jupiter orbit,
fueled by the mass and momentum of the small moon J-47 Barney, to provide a launching platform for the
interstellar probe her father's business partners are helping her to build. It's also the seat of her court, the
leading jurisprudential nexus in the outer solar system. Amber is the Queen, here, arbitrator and ruler. And
Sadeq is her judge and counsel.
A plaintiff Amber only knows as a radar blip thirty light-minutes away has filed a lawsuit in her court, alleging
malfeasance, heresy, and barratry against a semisentient corporate pyramid scheme that arrived in Jovian
space twelve million seconds ago and currently seems set on converting every other intelligence in the region
to its peculiar memeset. A whole bundle of multithreaded countersuits are dragging at her attention, in a
counterattack alleging that the light blip is in violation of copyright, patent, and trade secrecy laws by
discussing the interloper's intentions.
Right now, Amber isn't home on the Ring to hear the case in person. She's left Sadeq behind to grapple with
the balky mechanics of her legal system – tailor-designed to make corporate litigation a pain in the ass –
while she drags Pierre off on a diplomatic visit to another Jovian colony, the Nursery Republic. Planted by
the Franklin Trust's orphanage ship Ernst Sanger, the Nursery has grown over the past four years into a
spindly snowflake three kilometers across. A slow-growing O'Neil cylinder sprouts from its hub: Most of the
inhabitants of the space station are less than two years old, precocious additions to the Trust's borganism.
There's a piazza, paved with something not unlike rough marble, on the side of a hill that clings insecurely to
the inner edge of a spinning cup. The sky is a black vastness overhead, wheeling slowly around a central axis
lined up on Jupiter. Amber sprawls in a wicker chair, her legs stretched out before her and one arm flung
across her forehead. The wreckage of an incredible meal is scattered across the tables around her. Torpid
and full, she strokes the cat that lies curled in her lap. Pierre is off somewhere, touring one or another of the
prototype ecosystems that one or another of the borg's special interest minds is testing. Amber, for her part,
can't be bothered. She's just had a great meal, she doesn't have any lawsuits to worry about, everything back
home is on the critpath, and quality time like this is so hard to come by –
"Do you keep in touch with your father?" asks Monica.
"Mmm." The cat purrs quietly, and Amber strokes its flank. "We e-mail. Sometimes."
"I just wondered." Monica is the local borg den mother, willowy and brown-eyed and with a deceptively lazy
drawl – Yorkshire English overlaid with Silicon Valley speak. "I hear from him, y'know. From time to time.
Now that Gianni's retired, he doesn't have much to do down-well anymore. So he was talking about coming
out here."
"What? To Perijove?" Amber's eyes open in alarm: Aineko stops purring and looks round at Monica
accusingly.
"Don't worry." Monica sounds vaguely amused: "He wouldn't cramp your style, I think."
"But, out here –" Amber sits up. "Damn," she says, quietly. "What got into him?"
"Middle-aged restlessness, my downwell sibs say." Monica shrugs. "This time Annette didn't stop him. But he
hasn't made up his mind to travel yet."
"Good. Then he might not –" Amber stops. "The phrase, 'made up his mind', what exactly do you mean?"
Monica's smile mocks her for a few seconds before the older woman surrenders. "He's talking about
uploading."
"Is that embarrassing or what?" asks Ang. Amber glances at her, mildly annoyed, but Ang isn't looking her
way. So much for friends, Amber thinks. Being queen of all you survey is a great way of breaking up peer
relationships –
"He won't do it," Amber predicts. "Dad's burned out."
"He thinks he'll get it back if he optimizes himself for re-entrancy." Monica continues to smile. "I've been
telling him it's just what he needs."
"I do not want my father bugging me. Or my mother. Or Auntie 'Nette and Uncle Gianni. Memo to
immigration control: No entry rights for Manfred Macx or the other named individuals without clearance
through the Queen's secretary."
"What did he do to get you so uptight?" asks Monica idly.
Amber sighs, and subsides. "Nothing. It's not that I'm ungrateful or anything, but he's just so extropian, it's
embarrassing. Like, that was the last century's apocalypse. Y'know?"

"I think he was a really very forward-looking organic," Monica, speaking for the Franklin borg, asserts. Amber
looks away. Pierre would get it, she thinks. Pierre would understand her aversion to Manfred's showing up.
Pierre, too, wants to carve out his own niche without parents looking over his shoulders, although for very
different reasons. She focuses on someone male and more or less mature – Nicky, she thinks, though she
hasn't seen him for a long time – walking toward the piazza, bare-ass naked and beautifully tanned.
"Parents. What are they good for?" asks Amber, with all the truculence of her seventeen years. "Even if they
stay neotenous, they lose flexibility. And there's that long Paleolithic tradition of juvenile slavery. Inhuman, I
call it."
"How old were you when it was safe to leave you around the house on your own?" challenges Monica.
"Three. That's when I had my first implants." Amber smiles at the approaching young Adonis, who smiles
back: Yes, it's Nicky, and he seems pleased to see her. Life is good, she thinks, idly considering whether or not
to tell Pierre.
"Times change," remarks Monica. "Don't write your family off too soon; there might come a time when you
want their company."
"Huh." Amber pulls a face at the old borg component. "That's what you all say!"
***

As soon as Amber steps onto the grass, she can feel possibilities open up around her. She has management authority here,
and this universe is big, wide open, not like Sadeq's existential trap. A twitch of a sub-process reasserts her self-image, back to
short hair and comfortable clothing. Another twitch brings up a whole load of useful diagnostics. Amber has a nasty feeling
that she's running in a compatibility sandbox here – there are signs that her access to the simulation system's control
interface is very much via proxy – but at least she's got it.
"Wow! Back in the real world at last!" She can hardly contain her excitement, even forgetting to be pissed at Sadeq for
thinking she was just an actor in his Cartesian theatre's performance of Puritan Hell. "Look! It's the DMZ!"
They're standing on a grassy knoll overlooking a gleaming Mediterranean city. It snoozes beneath a Mandelbrot-fuzzy not-sun
that hangs at the center of a hyperbolic landscape, which dwindles into a blue yonder that seems incomprehensibly distant.
Circular baby-blue wells open in the walls of the world at regular intervals, connecting to other parts of the manifold. "How
big is it, ghost? In planetary simulation-equivalents."
"This demilitarized zone is an embedded reality, funneling all transfers between the local star system's router and the
civilization that built it. It uses on the order of a thousandth of the capacity of the Matrioshka brain it is part of, although
the runaway excursion currently in force has absorbed most of that. Matrioshka brain, you are familiar with the concept?"
The ghost sounds fussily pedantic.
Sadeq shakes his head. Amber glances at him, askance. "Take all the planets in a star system and dismantle them," she explains.
"Turn them into dust – structured nanocomp, powered by heat exchangers, spread in concentric orbits around the central
star. The inner orbitals run close to the melting point of iron, the outer ones are cold as liquid nitrogen, and each layer
runs off the waste heat of the next shell in. It's like a Russian doll made out of Dyson spheres, shell enclosing shell enclosing
shell, but it's not designed to support human life. It's computronium, matter optimized at the atomic level to support
computing, and they're all running uploads – Dad figured our own solar system could support, uh, about a hundred billion
times as many inhabitants as Earth. At a conservative estimate. As uploads, living in simulation space. If you first dismantle all
the planets and use the resulting materials to build a Matrioshka brain."
"Ah." Sadeq nods thoughtfully. "Is that your definition, too?" he asks, glancing up at the glowing point the ghost uses to
localize its presence.
"Substantially," it says, almost grudgingly.
"Substantially?" Amber glances around. A billion worlds to explore, she thinks dizzily. And that's just the firewall? She feels
obscurely cheated: You need to be vaster than human just to count the digits in the big numbers at play here, but there's
nothing fundamentally incomprehensible about it. This is the sort of civilization Dad said she could expect to live in, within
her meatbody life expectancy. Dad and his drinking buddies, singing, "Dismantle the Moon! Melt down Mars!" in a castle
outside Prague as they waited for the results of a shamelessly gerrymandered election to arrive in the third decade of the
third millennium. The Space and Freedom Party taking over the EU, and cranking up to escape velocity. But this is supposed
to be kiloparsecs from home, ancient alien civilizations and all that! Where's the exotic superscience? What about the
neuron stars, strange matter suns structured for computing at nucleonic, rather than electronic, speeds? I have a bad feeling
about this, she thinks, spawning a copy of herself to set up a private channel to Sadeq. It's not advanced enough. Do you suppose
these guys could be like the Wunch? Parasites or barbarians hitching a ride in the machine?
You believe it's lying to us? Sadeq sends back.
"Hmm." Amber sets off downslope toward the piazza below, at the heart of the fake town. "It looks a bit too human to me."
"Human," echoes Sadeq, a curious wistfulness in his voice. "Did you not say humans are extinct?"

"Your species is obsolete," the ghost comments smugly. "Inappropriately adapted to artificial realities. Poorly optimized
circuitry, excessively complex low-bandwidth sensors, messily global variables –"
"Yeah, yeah, I get the picture," says Amber, turning her attention to the town. "So why do you think we can deal with this
alien god you've got a problem with?"
"It asked for you," says the ghost, narrowing from an ellipse to a line, then shrinking to a dimensionless point of brilliance.
"And now it's coming. We-I not willing to risk exposure. Call us-me when you have slain the dragon. Goodbye."
"Oh shit –" Amber spins round. But she and Sadeq are alone beneath the hot sunlight from above. The piazza, like the one
in the Nursery Republic, is charmingly rustic – but there's nobody home, nothing but ornate cast-iron furniture basking
beneath the noon-bright sun, a table with a parasol over it, and something furry lying sprawled in a patch of sunlight beside
it.
"We appear to be alone for now," says Sadeq. He smiles crookedly, then nods at the table. "Maybe we should wait for our
host to arrive?"
"Our host." Amber peers around. "The ghost is kind of frightened of this alien. I wonder why?"
"It asked for us." Sadeq heads toward the table, pulls out a chair, and sits down carefully. "That could be very good news –
or very bad."
"Hmm." Amber finishes her survey, sees no sign of life. For lack of any better ideas, she ambles over to the table and sits
down on the other side of it from Sadeq. He looks slightly nervous beneath her inspection, but maybe it's just
embarrassment about having seen her in her underwear. If I had an afterlife like that, I'd be embarrassed about it, too, Amber
thinks to herself.
"Hey, you nearly tripped over –" Sadeq freezes, peering at something close to Amber's left foot. He looks puzzled for a
moment, then smiles broadly. "What are you doing here?" he asks her blind spot.
"What are you talking to?" she asks, startled.
He's talking to me, dummy, says something tantalizingly familiar from her blind spot. So the fuckwits are trying to use you to
dislodge me, hmm? That's not exactly clever.
"Who –" Amber squints at the flagstone, spawns a bunch of ghosts who tear hurriedly at her reality modification ackles.
Nothing seems to shift the blindness. "Are you the alien?"
"What else could I be?" the blind spot asks with heavy irony. "No, I'm your father's pet cat. Listen, do you want to get out of
here?"
"Uh." Amber rubs her eyes. "I can't see you, whatever you are," she says politely. "Do I know you?" She's got a strange sense
that she does know the blind spot, that it's really important, and she's missing something intimate to her own sense of
identity, but what it might be she can't tell.
"Yeah, kid." There's a note of world-weary amusement in the not-voice coming from the hazy patch on the ground. "They've
hacked you but good, both of you. Let me in, and I'll fix it."
"No!" Exclaims Amber, a second ahead of Sadeq, who looks at her oddly. "Are you really an invader?"
The blind spot sighs. "I'm as much an invader as you are, remember? I came here with you. Difference is, I'm not going to let
some stupid corporate ghost use me as fungible currency."
"Fungible –" Sadeq stops. "I remember you," he says slowly, with an expression of absolute, utter surprise on his face. "What
do you mean?"
The blind spot yawns, baring sharp ivory fangs. Amber shakes her head, dismissing the momentary hallucination. "Lemme
guess. You woke up in a room, and this alien ghost tells you the human species is extinct and asks you to do a number on
me. Is that right?"
Amber nods, as an icy finger of fear trails up and down her spine. "Is it lying?" she asks.
"Damn right." The blind spot is smiling, now, and the smile on the void won't go away – she can see the smile, just not the
body it's attached to. "My reckoning is, we're about sixteen light-years from Earth. The Wunch came through here, stripped
the dump, then took off for parts unknown; it's a trashhole, you wouldn't believe it. The main life-form is an incredibly
ornate corporate ecosphere, legal instruments breeding and replicating. They mug passing sapients and use them as
currency."
There's a triangular, pointy head behind the smile, slit eyes and sharp ears, a predatory, intelligent-looking but infinitely alien
face. Amber can see it out of the corners of her eyes when she looks around the piazza. "You mean we, uh, they grabbed us
when we appeared, and they've mangled my memories –" Amber suddenly finds it incredibly difficult to concentrate, but if
she focuses on the smile, she can almost see the body behind it, hunched like a furry chicken, tail wrapped neatly around its
front paws.

"Yeah. Except they didn't bargain on meeting something like me." The smile is infinitely wide, a Cheshire-cat grin on front of
an orange-and-brown stripy body that shimmers in front of Amber's gaze like a hallucination. "Your mother's cracking tools
are self-extending, Amber. Do you remember Hong Kong?"
"Hong –"
There is a moment of painless pressure, then Amber feels huge invisible barriers sliding away on all sides. She looks around,
for the first time seeing the piazza as it really is, half the crew of the Field Circus waiting nervously around her, the grinning
cat crouched on the floor at her feet, the enormous walls of recomplicating data that fence their little town off from the
gaping holes – interfaces to the other routers in the network.
"Welcome back," Pierre says gravely, as Amber gives a squeak of surprise and leans forward to pick up her cat. "Now you're
out from under, how about we start trying to figure out how to get home?"
***
Welcome to decade the sixth, millennium three. These old datelines don't mean so much anymore, for while
some billions of fleshbody humans are still infected with viral memes, the significance of theocentric dating has
been dealt a body blow. This may be the fifties, but what that means to you depends on how fast your reality
rate runs. The various upload clades exploding across the reaches of the solar system vary by several orders
of magnitude – some are barely out of 2049, while others are exploring the subjective thousandth
millennium.
While the Field Circus floats in orbit around an alien router (itself orbiting the brown dwarf Hyundai
+4904/ ), while Amber and her crew are trapped on the far side of a wormhole linking the router to a
-56
network of incomprehensibly vast alien mindscapes – while all this is going on, the damnfool human species
has finally succeeded in making itself obsolete. The proximate cause of its displacement from the pinnacle of
creation (or the pinnacle of teleological self-congratulation, depending on your stance on evolutionary
biology) is an attack of self-aware corporations. The phrase "smart money" has taken on a whole new
meaning, for the collision between international business law and neurocomputing technology has given rise
to a whole new family of species – fast-moving corporate carnivores in the Net. The planet Mercury has been
broken up by a consortium of energy brokers, and Venus is an expanding debris cloud, energized to a
violent glare by the trapped and channeled solar output. A million billion fist-sized computing caltrops,
backsides glowing dull red with the efflux from their thinking, orbit the sun at various inclinations no farther
out than Mercury used to be.
Billions of fleshbody humans refuse to have anything to do with the blasphemous new realities. Many of their
leaders denounce the uploads and AIs as soulless machines. Many more are timid, harboring self-preservation
memes that amplify a previously healthy aversion to having one's brain peeled like an onion by mind-mapping
robots into an all-pervading neurosis. Sales of electrified tinfoil-lined hats are at an all-time high. Still,
hundreds of millions have already traded their meat puppets for mind machines, and they breed fast. In
another few years, the fleshbody populace will be an absolute minority of the posthuman clade. Sometime
later, there will probably be a war. The dwellers in the thoughtcloud are hungry for dumb matter to
convert, and the fleshbodies make notoriously poor use of the collection of silicon and rare elements that
pool at the bottom of the gravity well that is Earth.
Energy and thought are driving a phase-change in the condensed matter substance of the solar system. The
MIPS per kilogram metric is on the steep upward leg of a sigmoid curve – dumb matter is coming to life as
the mind children restructure everything with voracious nanomechanical servants. The thoughtcloud forming
in orbit around the sun will ultimately be the graveyard of a biological ecology, another marker in space
visible to the telescopes of any new iron-age species with the insight to understand what they're seeing: the
death throes of dumb matter, the birth of a habitable reality vaster than a galaxy and far speedier. Death
throes that, within a few centuries, will mean the extinction of biological life within a light-year or so of that
star – for the majestic Matrioshka brains, though they are the pinnacles of sentient civilization, are
intrinsically hostile environments for fleshy life.
***
Pierre, Donna-the-all-seeing-eye, and Su Ang fill Amber in on what they've discovered about the bazaar – as they call the
space the ghost referred to as the demilitarized zone – over ice-cold margaritas and a very good simulation of a sociable
joint. Some of them have been on the loose in here for subjective years. There's a lot of information to absorb.
"The physical layer is half a light-hour in diameter, four hundred times as massive as Earth," Pierre explains. "Not solid, of
course – the largest component is about the size my fist used to be." Amber squints, trying to remember how big that was –
scale factors are hard to remember accurately. "I met this old chatbot that said it's outlived its original star, but I'm not sure
it's running with a full deck. Anyway, if it's telling the truth, we're a third of a light year out from a closely coupled binary
system – they use orbital lasers the size of Jupiter to power it without getting too close to all those icky gravity wells."
Amber is intimidated, despite her better judgment, because this bizarre bazaar is several hundred billion times as big as the
totality of human presingularity civilization. She tries not to show it in front of the others, but she's worried that getting
home may be impossible – requiring enterprise beyond the economic event horizon, as realistic a proposition as a dime

debuting as a dollar bill. Still, she's got to at least try. Just knowing about the existence of the bazaar will change so many
things ...
"How much money can we lay our hands on?" She asks. "What is money hereabouts, anyway? Assuming they've got a
scarcity-mediated economy. Bandwidth, maybe?"
"Ah, well." Pierre looks at her oddly. "That's the problem. Didn't the ghost tell you?"
"Tell me?" Amber raises an eyebrow. "Yeah, but it hasn't exactly proven to be a reliable guide to anything, has it?"
"Tell her," Su Ang says quietly. She looks away, embarrassed by something.
"They've got a scarcity economy all right," says Pierre. "Bandwidth is the limited resource, that and matter. This whole
civilization is tied together locally because if you move too far away, well, it takes ages to catch up on the gossip. Matrioshka
brain intelligences are much more likely to stay at home than anybody realized, even though they chat on the phone a lot.
And they use things that come from other cognitive universes as, well, currency. We came in through the coin slot, is it any
wonder we ended up in the bank?"
"That's so deeply wrong that I don't know where to begin," Amber grumbles. "How did they get into this mess?"
"Don't ask me." Pierre shrugs. "I have the distinct feeling that anyone or anything we meet in this place won't have any more
of a clue than we do – whoever or whatever built this brain, there ain't nobody home anymore except the self-propelled
corporations and hitchhikers like the Wunch. We're in the dark, just like they were."
"Huh. You mean they built something like this, then they went extinct? That sounds so dumb ..."
Su Ang sighs. "They got too big and complex to go traveling once they built themselves a bigger house to live in. Extinction
tends to be what happens to overspecialized organisms that are stuck in one environmental niche for too long. If you posit a
singularity, then maximization of local computing resources – like this – as the usual end state for tool users, is it any
wonder none of them ever came calling on us?"
Amber focuses on the table in front of her, rests the heel of her palm on the cool metal, and tries to remember how to fork
a second copy of her state vector. A moment later, her ghost obligingly fucks with the physics model of the table. Iron gives
way like rubber beneath her fingertips, a pleasant elasticity. "Okay, we have some control over the universe, at least that's
something to work with. Have any of you tried any self-modification?"
"That's dangerous," Pierre says emphatically. "The more of us the better before we start doing that stuff. And we need some
firewalling of our own."
"How deep does reality go, here?" asks Sadeq. It's almost the first question he's asked of his own volition, and Amber takes it
as a positive sign that he's finally coming out of his shell.
"Oh, the Planck length is about a hundredth of a millimeter in this world. Too small to see, comfortably large for the
simulation engines to handle. Not like real space-time."
"Well, then." Sadeq pauses. "They can zoom their reality if they need to?"
"Yeah, fractals work in here." Pierre nods. "I didn't –"
"This place is a trap," Su Ang says emphatically.
"No it isn't," Pierre replies, nettled.
"What do you mean, a trap?" asks Amber.
"We've been here a while," says Ang. She glances at Aineko, who sprawls on the flagstones, snoozing or whatever it is that
weakly superhuman AIs do when they're emulating a sleeping cat. "After your cat broke us out of bondage, we had a look
around. There are things out there that –" She shivers. "Humans can't survive in most of the simulation spaces here.
Universes with physics models that don't support our kind of neural computing. You could migrate there, but you'd need to
be ported to a whole new type of logic – by the time you did that, would you still be you? Still, there are enough entities
roughly as complex as we are to prove that the builders aren't here anymore. Just lesser sapients, rooting through the
wreckage. Worms and parasites squirming through the body after nightfall on the battlefield."
"I ran into the Wunch," Donna volunteers helpfully. "The first couple of times they ate my ghost, but eventually I figured out
how to talk to them."
"And there's other aliens, too," Su Ang adds gloomily. "Just nobody you'd want to meet on a dark night."
"So there's no hope of making contact," Amber summarizes. "At least, not with anything transcendent and well-intentioned
toward visiting humans."
"That's probably right," Pierre concedes. He doesn't sound happy about it.

"So we're stuck in a pocket universe with limited bandwidth to home and a bunch of crazy slum dwellers who've moved into
the abandoned and decaying mansion and want to use us for currency. 'Jesus saves, and redeems souls for valuable gifts.'
Yeah?"
"Yeah." Su Ang looks depressed.
"Well." Amber glances at Sadeq speculatively. Sadeq is staring into the distance, at the crazy infinite sunspot that limns the
square with shadows. "Hey, god-man. Got a question for you."
"Yes?" Sadeq looks at her, a slightly dazed expression on his face. "I'm sorry, I am just feeling the jaws of a larger trap around
my throat –"
"Don't be." Amber grins, and it is not a pleasant expression. "Have you ever been to Brooklyn?"
"No, why –"
"Because you're going to help me sell these lying bastards a bridge. Okay? And when we've sold it we're going to use the
money to pay the purchasing fools to drive us across, so we can go home. Listen, this is what I'm planning ..."
***
"I can do this, I think," Sadeq says, moodily examining the Klein bottle on the table. The bottle is half-empty, its fluid contents
invisible around the corner of the fourth-dimensional store. "I spent long enough alone in there to –" He shivers.
"I don't want you damaging yourself," Amber says, calmly enough, because she has an ominous feeling that their survival in
this place has an expiry date attached.
"Oh, never fear." Sadeq grins lopsidedly. "One pocket hell is much like another."
"Do you understand why –"
"Yes, yes," he says dismissively. "We can't send copies of ourselves into it, that would be an abomination. It needs to be
unpopulated, yes?"
"Well, the idea is to get us home, not leave thousands of copies of ourselves trapped in a pocket universe here. Isn't that it?"
Su Ang asks hesitantly. She's looking distracted, most of her attention focused on absorbing the experiences of a dozen
ghosts she's spun off to attend to perimeter security.
"Who are we selling this to?" asks Sadeq. "If you want me to make it attractive –"
"It doesn't need to be a complete replica of the Earth. It just has to be a convincing advertisement for a presingularity
civilization full of humans. You've got two-and-seventy zombies to dissect for their brains; bolt together a bunch of variables
you can apply to them, and you can permutate them to look a bit more varied."
Amber turns her attention to the snoozing cat. "Hey, furball. How long have we been here really, in real time? Can you grab
Sadeq some more resources for his personal paradise garden?"
Aineko stretches and yawns, totally feline, then looks up at Amber with narrowed eyes and raised tail. "'Bout eighteen
minutes, wall-clock time." The cat stretches again and sits, front paws drawn together primly, tail curled around them. "The
ghosts are pushing, you know? I don't think I can sustain this for too much longer. They're not good at hacking people, but I
think it won't be too long before they instantiate a new copy of you, one that'll be predisposed to their side."
"I don't get why they didn't assimilate you along with the rest of us."
"Blame your mother again – she's the one who kept updating the digital rights management code on my personality. 'Illegal
consciousness is copyright theft' sucks until an alien tries to rewire your hindbrain with a debugger; then it's a lifesaver."
Aineko glances down and begins washing one paw. "I can give your mullah-man about six days, subjective time. After that, all
bets are off."
"I will take it, then." Sadeq stands. "Thank you." He smiles at the cat, a smile that fades to translucency, hanging in the
simulated air like an echo as the priest returns to his tower – this time with a blueprint and a plan in mind.
"That leaves just us." Su Ang glances at Pierre, back to Amber. "Who are you going to sell this crazy scheme to?"
Amber leans back and smiles. Behind her, Donna – her avatar an archaic movie camera suspended below a model helicopter
– is filming everything for posterity. She nods lazily at the reporter. "She's the one who gave me the idea. Who do we know
who's dumb enough to buy into a scam like this?"
Pierre looks at her suspiciously. "I think we've been here before," he says slowly. "You aren't going to make me kill anyone,
are you?"
"I don't think that'll be necessary, unless the corporate ghosts think we're going to get away from them and are greedy
enough to want to kill us."

"You see, she learned from last time," Ang comments, and Amber nods. "No more misunderstandings, right?" She beams at
Amber.
Amber beams back at her. "Right. And that's why you –" she points at Pierre – "are going to go find out if any relics of the
Wunch are hanging about here. I want you to make them an offer they won't refuse."
***
"How much for just the civilization?" asks the Slug.
Pierre looks down at it thoughtfully. It's not really a terrestrial mollusk: Slugs on Earth aren't two meters long and don't
have lacy white exoskeletons to hold their chocolate-colored flesh in shape. But then, it isn't really the alien it appears to be.
It's a defaulting corporate instrument that has disguised itself as a long-extinct alien upload, in the hope that its creditors
won't recognize it if it looks like a randomly evolved sentient. One of the stranded members of Amber's expedition made
contact with it a couple of subjective years ago, while exploring the ruined city at the center of the firewall. Now Pierre's
here because it seems to be one of their most promising leads. Emphasis on the word promising – because it promises much,
but there is some question over whether it can indeed deliver.
"The civilization isn't for sale," Pierre says slowly. The translation interface shimmers, storing up his words and transforming
them into a different deep grammar, not merely translating his syntax but mapping equivalent meanings where necessary.
"But we can give you privileged observer status if that's what you want. And we know what you are. If you're interested in
finding a new exchange to be traded on, your existing intellectual property assets will be worth rather more there than
here."
The rogue corporation rears up slightly and bunches into a fatter lump. Its skin blushes red in patches. "Must think about
this. Is your mandatory accounting time cycle fixed or variable term? Are self-owned corporate entities able to enter
contracts?"
"I could ask my patron," Pierre says casually. He suppresses a stab of angst. He's still not sure where he and Amber stand,
but theirs is far more than just a business relationship, and he worries about the risks she's taking. "My patron has a
jurisdiction within which she can modify corporate law to accommodate your requirements. Your activities on a wider scale
might require shell companies –" the latter concept echoes back in translation to him as host organisms – "but that can be
taken care of."
The translation membrane wibbles for a while, apparently reformulating some more abstract concepts in a manner that the
corporation can absorb. Pierre is reasonably confident that it'll take the offer, however. When it first met them, it boasted
about its control over router hardware at the lowest levels. But it also bitched and moaned about the firewall protocols that
were blocking it from leaving (before rather rudely trying to eat its conversationalist). He waits patiently, looking around at
the swampy landscape, mudflats punctuated by clumps of spiky violet ferns. The corporation has to be desperate, to be
thinking of the bizarre proposition Amber has dreamed up for him to pitch to it.
"Sounds interesting," the Slug declares after a brief confirmatory debate with the membrane. "If I supply a suitable genome,
can you customize a container for it?"
"I believe so," Pierre says carefully. "For your part, can you deliver the energy we need?"
"From a gate?" For a moment the translation membrane hallucinates a stick-human, shrugging. "Easy. Gates are all entangled:
Dump coherent radiation in at one, get it out at another. Just get me out of this firewall first."
"But the lightspeed lag –"
"No problem. You go first, then a dumb instrument I leave behind buys up power and sends it after. Router network is
synchronous, within framework of state machines that run Universe 1.0; messages propagate at same speed, speed of light in
vacuum, except use wormholes to shorten distances between nodes. Whole point of the network is that it is nonlossy. Who
would trust their mind to a communications channel that might partially randomize them in transit?"
Pierre goes cross-eyed, trying to understand the implications of the Slug's cosmology. But there isn't really time, here and
now: They've got on the order of a minute of wall-clock time left to get everything sorted out, if Aineko is right. One minute
to go before the angry ghosts start trying to break into the DMZ by other means. "If you are willing to try this, we'd be
happy to accommodate you," he says, thinking of crossed fingers and rabbits' feet and firewalls.
"It's a deal," the membrane translates the Slug's response back at him. "Now we exchange shares/plasmids/ownership? Then
merger complete?"
Pierre stares at the Slug: "But this is a business arrangement!" he protests. "What's sex got to do with it?"
"Apologies offered. I am thinking we have a translation error. You said this was to be a merging of businesses?"
"Not that way. It's a contract. We agree to take you with us. In return, you help lure the Wunch into the domain we're
setting up for them and configure the router at the other end ..."
And so on.

Steeling herself, Amber recalls the address the ghost gave her for Sadeq's afterlife universe. In her own subjective time it's
been about half an hour since he left. "Coming?" she asks her cat.
"Don't think I will," says Aineko. It looks away, blissfully unconcerned.
"Bah." Amber tenses, then opens the port to Sadeq's pocket universe.
As usual she finds herself indoors, standing on an ornate mosaic floor in a room with whitewashed walls and peaked
windows. But there's something different about it, and after a moment, she realizes what it is. The sound of vehicle traffic
from outside, the cooing of pigeons on the rooftops, someone shouting across the street: There are people here.
She walks over to the nearest window and looks out, then recoils. It's hot outside. Dust and fumes hang in air the color of
cement over rough-finished concrete apartment buildings, their roofs covered in satellite uplinks and cheap, garish LED
advertising panels. Looking down she sees motor scooters, cars – filthy, fossil-fueled behemoths, a tonne of steel and
explosives in motion to carry only one human, a mass ratio worse than an archaic ICBM – brightly dressed people walking
to and fro. A news helicam buzzes overhead, lenses darting and glinting at the traffic.
"Just like home, isn't it?" says Sadeq, behind her.
Amber starts. "This is where you grew up? This is Yazd?"
"It doesn't exist anymore, in real space." Sadeq looks thoughtful, but far more animated than the barely conscious parody of
himself that she'd rescued from this building – back when it was a mediaeval vision of the afterlife – scant subjective hours
ago. He cracks a smile: "Probably a good thing. We were dismantling it even while we were preparing to leave, you know?"
"It's detailed." Amber throws her eyes at the scene out the window, multiplexes them, and tells them to send little virtual
ghosts dancing through the streets of the Iranian industrial 'burb. Overhead, big Airbuses ply the skyways, bearing pilgrims
on the hajj, tourists to the coastal resorts on the Persian Gulf, produce to the foreign markets.
"It's the best time I could recall," Sadeq says. "I didn't spend many days here then – I was in Qom, studying, and Kazakhstan,
for cosmonaut training – but it's meant to be the early twenties. After the troubles, after the fall of the guardians; a young,
energetic, liberal country full of optimism and faith in democracy. Values that weren't doing well elsewhere."
"I thought democracy was a new thing there?"
"No." Sadeq shakes his head. "There were prodemocracy riots in Tehran in the nineteenth century, did you know that?
That's why the first revolution – no." He makes a cutting gesture. "Politics and faith are a combustible combination." He
frowns. "But look. Is this what you wanted?"
Amber recalls her scattered eyes – some of which have flown as much as a thousand kilometers from her locus – and
concentrates on reintegrating their visions of Sadeq's re-creation. "It looks convincing. But not too convincing."
"That was the idea."
"Well, then." She smiles. "Is it just Iran? Or did you take any liberties around the edges?"
"Who, me?" He raises an eyebrow. "I have enough doubts about the morality of this – project – without trying to trespass
on Allah's territory, peace be unto him. I promise you, there are no sapients in this world but us. The people are the hollow
shells of my dreaming, storefront dummies. The animals are crude bitmaps. This is what you asked for, and no more."
"Well, then." Amber pauses. She recalls the expression on the dirt-smudged face of a little boy, bouncing a ball at his
companions by the boarded-up front of a gas station on a desert road; remembers the animated chatter of two synthetic
housewives, one in traditional black and the other in some imported Eurotrash fashion. "Are you sure they aren't real?" she
asks.
"Quite sure." But for a moment, she sees Sadeq looking uncertain. "Shall we go? Do you have the occupiers ready to move in
yet?"
"Yes to the first, and Pierre's working on the second. Come on, we don't want to get trampled by the squatters." She waves
and opens a door back onto the piazza where her robot cat – the alien's nightmare intruder in the DMZ – sleeps, chasing
superintelligent dream mice through multidimensional realities. "Sometimes I wonder if I'm conscious. Thinking these thoughts
gives me the creeps. Let's go and sell some aliens a bridge in Brooklyn."

Amber confronts the mendacious ghost in the windowless room stolen from 2001.
"You have confined the monster," the ghost states.
"Yes." Amber waits for a subjective moment, feeling delicate fronds tickle at the edges of her awareness in what seems to be a
timing channel attack. She feels a momentary urge to sneeze, and a hot flash of anger that passes almost immediately.

"And you have modified yourself to lock out external control," the ghost adds. "What is it that you want, Autonome
Amber?"
"Don't you have any concept of individuality?" she asks, annoyed by its presumption at meddling with her internal states.
"Individuality is an unnecessary barrier to information transfer," says the ghost, morphing into its original form, a translucent
reflection of her own body. "It reduces the efficiency of a capitalist economy. A large block of the DMZ is still inaccessible to
we-me. Are you sure you have defeated the monster?"
"It'll do as I say," Amber replies, forcing herself to sound more confident than she feels – sometimes that damned transhuman
cyborg cat is no more predictable than a real feline. "Now, the matter of payment arises."
"Payment." The ghost sounds amused. But Pierre's filled her in on what to look for, and Amber can now see the translation
membranes around it. Their color shift maps to a huge semantic distance; the creature on the other side, even though it
looks like a ghost-image of herself, is very far from human. "How can we-us be expected to pay our own money for
rendering services to us?"
Amber smiles. "We want an open channel back to the router we arrived through."
"Impossible," says the ghost.
"We want an open channel, and for it to stay open for six hundred million seconds after we clear it."
"Impossible," the ghost repeats.
"We can trade you a whole civilization," Amber says blandly. "A whole human nation, millions of individuals. Just let us go,
and we'll see to it."
"You – please wait." The ghost shimmers slightly, fuzzing at the edges.
Amber opens a private channel to Pierre while the ghost confers with its other nodes. Are the Wunch in place yet? she sends.
They're moving in. This bunch don't remember what happened on the Field Circus, memories of those events never made it back to
them. So the Slug's got them to cooperate. It's kinda scary to watch – like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, you know?
I don't care if it's scary to watch, Amber replies, I need to know if we're ready yet.
Sadeq says yes, the universe is ready.
Right, pack yourself down. We'll be moving soon.
The ghost is firming up in front of her. "A whole civilization?" it asks. "That is not possible. Your arrival –" It pauses, fuzzing a
little. Hah, Gotcha! thinks Amber. Liar, liar, pants on fire! "You cannot possibly have found a human civilization in the archives?"
"The monster you complain about that came through with us is a predator," she asserts blandly. "It swallowed an entire
nation before we heroically attracted its attention and induced it to follow us into the router. It's an archivore – everything
was inside it, still frozen until we expanded it again. This civilization will already have been restored from hot shadows in our
own solar system: There is nothing to gain by taking it home with us. But we need to return to ensure that no more
predators of this type discover the router – or the high-bandwidth hub we linked to it."
"You are sure you have killed this monster?" asks the ghost. "It would be inconvenient if it were to emerge from hiding in its
digest archives."
"I can guarantee it won't trouble you again if you let us go," says Amber, mentally crossing her fingers. The ghost doesn't
seem to have noticed the huge wedge of fractally compressed data that bloats her personal scope by an order of magnitude.
She can still feel Aineko's goodbye smile inside her head, an echo of ivory teeth trusting her to revive it if the escape plan
succeeds.
"We-us agree." The ghost twists weirdly, morphs into a five-dimensional hypersphere. It bubbles violently for a moment, then
spits out a smaller token – a warped distortion in the air, like a gravityless black hole. "Here is your passage. Show us the
civilization."
"Okay " – Now! – "catch." Amber twitches an imaginary muscle, and one wall of the room dissolves, forming a doorway into
Sadeq's existential hell, now redecorated as a fair facsimile of a twenty-first-century industrial city in Iran, and populated by a
Wunch of parasites who can't believe what they've lucked into – an entire continent of zombies waiting to host their
flesh-hungry consciousness.
The ghost drifts toward the open window. Amber grabs the hole and yanks it open, gets a grip on her own thoughts, and
sends Open wide! on the channel everybody is listening in on. For a moment time stands still, and then –

vacuum is anything but dark. A sapphire glare as bright as the noonday sun on Mars shines on the crazy diamond, billowing
and cascading off sails as fine as soap bubbles that slowly drift and tense away from the can. The runaway Slug-corporation's
proxy has hacked the router's firmware, and the open wormhole gate that feeds power to it is shining with the brilliance of
a nuclear fireball, laser light channeled from a star many light-years away to power the Field Circus on its return trip to the
once-human solar system.
Amber has retreated, with Pierre, into a simulation of her home aboard the Ring Imperium. One wall of her bedroom is a
solid slab of diamond, looking out across the boiling Jovian ionosphere from an orbit low enough to make the horizon
appear flat. They're curled together in her bed, a slightly more comfortable copy of the royal bed of King Henry VIII of
England. It appears to be carved from thousand-year-old oak beams. As with so much else about the Ring Imperium,
appearances are deceptive; and this is even more true of the cramped simulation spaces aboard the Field Circus, as it limps
toward a tenth the speed of light, the highest velocity it's likely to achieve on a fraction of its original sail area.
"Let me get this straight. You convinced. The locals. That a simulation of Iran, with zombie bodies that had been taken over
by members of the Wunch. Was a human civilization?"
"Yeah." Amber stretches lazily and smirks at him. "It's their damn fault; if the corporate collective entities didn't use conscious
viewpoints as money, they wouldn't have fallen for a trick like that, would they?"
"People. Money."
"Well." She yawns, then sits up and snaps her finger imperiously: Down-stuffed pillows appear behind her back, and a silver
salver bearing two full glasses of wine materializes between them. "Corporations are life-forms back home, too, aren't they?
And we trade them. We give our AIs corporations to make them legal entities, but the analogy goes deeper. Look at any
company headquarters, fitted out with works of art and expensive furniture and staff bowing and scraping everywhere –"
" – They're the new aristocracy. Right?"
"Wrong. When they take over, what you get is more like the new biosphere. Hell, the new primordial soup: prokaryotes,
bacteria, and algae, mindlessly swarming, trading money for plasmids." The Queen passes her consort a wineglass. When he
drinks from it, it refills miraculously. "Basically, sufficiently complex resource-allocation algorithms reallocate scarce resources
... and if you don't jump to get out of their way, they'll reallocate you. I think that's what happened inside the Matrioshka
brain we ended up in: Judging by the Slug it happens elsewhere, too. You've got to wonder where the builders of that
structure came from. And where they went. And whether they realized that the destiny of intelligent tool-using life was to be
a stepping-stone in the evolution of corporate instruments."
"Maybe they tried to dismantle the companies before the companies spent them." Pierre looks worried. "Running up a
national debt, importing luxurious viewpoint extensions, munching exotic dreams. Once they plugged into the Net, a
primitive Matrioshka civilization would be like, um." He pauses. "Tribal. A primitive postsingularity civilization meeting the
galactic net for the first time. Overawed. Wanting all the luxuries. Spending their capital, their human – or alien – capital,
the meme machines that built them. Until there's nothing left but a howling wilderness of corporate mechanisms looking for
someone to own."
"Speculation."
"Idle speculation," he agrees.
"But we can't ignore it." She nods. "Maybe some early corporate predator built the machines that spread the wormholes
around brown dwarfs and ran the router network on top of them in an attempt to make money fast. By not putting them
in the actual planetary systems likely to host tool-using life, they'd ensure that only near-singularity civilizations would
stumble over them. Civilizations that had gone too far to be easy prey probably wouldn't send a ship out to look ... so the
network would ensure a steady stream of yokels new to the big city to fleece. Only they set the mechanism in motion billions
of years ago and went extinct, leaving the network to propagate, and now there's nothing out there but burned-out
Matrioshka civilizations and howling parasites like the angry ghosts and the Wunch. And victims like us." She shudders and
changes the subject: "Speaking of aliens, is the Slug happy?"
"Last time I checked on him, yeah." Pierre blows on his wineglass and it dissolves into a million splinters of light. He looks
dubious at the mention of the rogue corporate instrument they're taking with them. "I don't trust him out in the
unrestricted sim-spaces yet, but he delivered on the fine control for the router's laser. I just hope you don't ever have to
actually use him, if you follow my drift. I'm a bit worried that Aineko is spending so much time in there."
"So that's where she is? I'd been worrying."
"Cats never come when you call them, do they?"
"There is that," she agrees. Then, with a worried glance at the vision of Jupiter's cloudscape: "I wonder what we'll find when
we get there?"
Outside the window, the imaginary Jovian terminator is sweeping toward them with eerie rapidity, sucking them toward an
uncertain nightfall.

PART 3: Singularity
There's a sucker born every minute.
– P. T. Barnum

Chapter 7: Curator
Sirhan stands on the edge of an abyss, looking down at a churning orange-and-gray cloudscape far below. The air this close
to the edge is chilly and smells slightly of ammonia, although that might be his imagination at work – there's little chance of
any gas exchange taking place across the transparent pressure wall of the flying city. He feels as if he could reach out and
touch the swirling vaporscape. There's nobody else around, this close to the edge – it's an icy sensation to look out across
the roiling depths, at an ocean of gas so cold human flesh would freeze within seconds of exposure, knowing that there's
nothing solid out there for tens of thousands of kilometers. The sense of isolation is aggravated by the paucity of bandwidth,
this far out of the system. Most people huddle close to the hub, for comfort and warmth and low latency: posthumans are
gregarious.
Beneath Sirhan's feet, the lily-pad city is extending itself, mumbling and churning in endless self-similar loops like a cubist
blastoma growing in the upper atmosphere of Saturn. Great ducts suck in methane and other atmospheric gases, apply
energy, polymerize and diamondize, and crack off hydrogen to fill the lift cells high above. Beyond the sapphire dome of the
city's gasbag, an azure star glares with the speckle of laser light; humanity's first – and so far, last – starship, braking into
orbit on the last shredded remnant of its light sail.
He's wondering maliciously how his mother will react to discovering her bankruptcy when the light above him flickers.
Something gray and unpleasant splatters against the curve of nearly invisible wall in front of him, leaving a smear. He takes a
step back and looks up angrily. "Fuck you!" he yells. Raucous cooing laughter follows him away from the boundary, feral
pigeon voices mocking. "I mean it," he warns, flicking a gesture at the air above his head. Wings scatter in a burst of thunder
as a slab of wind solidifies, thistledown-shaped nanomachines suspended on the breeze locking edge to edge to form an
umbrella over his head. He walks away from the perimeter, fuming, leaving the pigeons to look for another victim.
Annoyed, Sirhan finds a grassy knoll a couple of hundred meters from the rim and around the curve of the lily-pad from the
museum buildings. It's far enough from other humans that he can sit undisturbed with his thoughts, far enough out to see
over the edge without being toilet-bombed by flocking flying rats. (The flying city, despite being the product of an advanced
technology almost unimaginable two decades before, is full of bugs – software complexity and scaling laws ensured that the
preceding decades of change acted as a kind of cosmological inflationary period for design glitches, and an infestation of
passenger pigeons is by no means the most inexplicable problem this biosphere harbors.)
In an attempt to shut the more unwelcome manifestations of cybernature out, he sits under the shade of an apple tree and
marshals his worlds around him. "When is my grandmother arriving?" he asks one of them, speaking into an antique
telephone in the world of servants, where everything is obedient and knows its place. The city humors him, for its own
reasons.
"She is still containerized, but aerobraking is nearly over. Her body will be arriving down-well in less than two megaseconds."
The city's avatar in this machinima is a discreet Victorian butler, stony-faced and respectful. Sirhan eschews intrusive memory
interfaces; for an eighteen-year-old, he's conservative to the point of affectation, favoring voice commands and
anthropomorphic agents over the invisible splicing of virtual neural nets.
"You're certain she's transferred successfully?" Sirhan asks anxiously. He heard a lot about his grandmama when he was
young, very little of it complimentary. Nevertheless, the old bat must be a lot more flexible than his mother ever gave her
credit for, to be subjecting herself to this kind of treatment for the first time at her current age.
"I'm as certain as I can be, young master, for anyone who insists on sticking to their original phenotype without benefit of
off-line backup or medical implants. I regret that omniscience is not within my remit. Would you like me to make further
specific inquiries?"
"No." Sirhan peers up at the bright flare of laser light, visible even through the soap-bubble membrane that holds in the
breathable gas mix, and the trillions of liters of hot hydrogen in the canopy above it. "As long as you're sure she'll arrive
before the ship?" Tuning his eyes to ultraviolet, he watches the emission spikes, sees the slow strobing of the low-bandwidth
AM modulation that's all the starship can manage by way of downlink communication until it comes within range of the
system manifold. It's sending the same tiresomely repetitive question about why it's being redirected to Saturn that it's been
putting out for the past week, querying the refusal to supply terawatts of propulsion energy on credit.
"Unless there's a spike in their power beam, you can be certain of that," City replies reassuringly. "And you can be certain
also that your grandmother will revive comfortably."
"One may hope so." To undertake the interplanetary voyage in corporeal person, at her age, without any upgrades or
augmentation, must take courage, he decides. "When she wakes up, if I'm not around, ask her for an interview slot on my
behalf. For the archives, of course."
"It will be my pleasure." City bobs his head politely.

"That will be all," Sirhan says dismissively, and the window into servantspace closes. Then he looks back up at the pinprick of
glaring blue laser light near the zenith. Tough luck, Mom, he subvocalizes for his journal cache. Most of his attention is forked
at present, focused on the rich historical windfall from the depths of the singularity that is coming his way, in the form of the
thirty-year-old starwisp's Cartesian theatre. But he can still spare some schadenfreude for the family fortunes. All your assets
belong to me, now. He smiles, inwardly. I'll just have to make sure they're put to a sensible use this time.

"I don't see why they're diverting us toward Saturn. It's not as if they can possibly have dismantled Jupiter already, is it?" asks
Pierre, rolling the chilled beer bottle thoughtfully between fingers and thumb.
"Why not you ask Amber?" replies the velociraptor squatting beside the log table. (Boris's Ukrainian accent is unimpeded by
the dromaeosaurid's larynx; in point of fact, it's an affectation, one he could easily fix by sideloading an English
pronunciation patch if he wanted to.)
"Well." Pierre shakes his head. "She's spending all her time with that Slug, no multiplicity access, privacy ackles locked right
down. I could get jealous." His voice doesn't suggest any deep concern.
"What's to get jealous about? Just ask to fork instance to talk to you, make love, show boyfriend good time, whatever."
"Hah!" Pierre chuckles grimly, then drains the last drops from the bottle into his mouth. He throws it away in the direction
of a clump of cycads, then snaps his fingers; another one appears in its place.
"Are two megaseconds out from Saturn in any case," Boris points out, then pauses to sharpen his inch-long incisors on one
end of the table. Fangs crunch through timber like wet cardboard. "Grrrrn. Am seeing most peculiar emission spectra from
inner solar system. Foggy flying down bottom of gravity well. Am wondering, does ensmartening of dumb matter extend past
Jovian orbit now?"
"Hmm." Pierre takes a swig from the bottle and puts it down. "That might explain the diversion. But why haven't they
powered up the lasers on the Ring for us? You missed that, too." For reasons unknown, the huge battery of launch lasers
had shut down, some millions of seconds after the crew of the Field Circus had entered the router, leaving it adrift in the
cold darkness.
"Don't know why are not talking." Boris shrugged. "At least are still alive there, as can tell from the 'set course for Saturn,
following thus-and-such orbital elements' bit. Someone is paying attention. Am telling you from beginning, though, turning
entire solar system into computronium is real bad idea, long-term. Who knows how far has gone already?"
"Hmm, again." Pierre draws a circle in the air. "Aineko," he calls, "are you listening?"
"Don't bug me." A faint green smile appears in the circle, just the suggestion of fangs and needle-sharp whiskers. "I had an
idea I was sleeping furiously."
Boris rolls one turreted eye and drools on the tabletop. "Munch munch," he growls, allowing his saurian body-brain to put
in a word.
"What do you need to sleep for? This is a fucking sim, in case you hadn't noticed."
"I enjoy sleeping," replies the cat, irritably lashing its just-now-becoming-visible tail. "What do you want? Fleas?"
"No thanks," Pierre says hastily. Last time he called Aineko's bluff the cat had filled three entire pocket universes with
scurrying gray mice. One of the disadvantages of flying aboard a starship the size of a baked bean can full of smart matter
was the risk that some of the passengers could get rather too creative with the reality control system. This Cretaceous kaffee
klatsch was just Boris's entertainment partition; compared to some of the other simulation spaces aboard the Field Circus,
it was downright conservative. "Look, do you have any updates on what's going on down-well? We're only twenty objective
days out from orbital insertion, and there's so little to see –"
"They're not sending us power." Aineko materializes fully now, a large orange-and-white cat with a swirl of brown fur in the
shape on an @-symbol covering her ribs. For whatever reason, she plants herself on the table tauntingly close to Boris's
velociraptor body's nose. "No propulsion laser means insufficient bandwidth. They're talking in Latin-1 text at 1200 baud, if
you care to know." (Which is an insult, given the ship's multi-avabit storage capacity – one avabit is Avogadro's number of
bits; about 1023 bytes, several billion times the size of the Internet in 2001 – and outrageous communications bandwidth.)
"Amber says, come and see her now. Audience chamber. Informal, of course. I think she wants to discuss it."
"Informal? Am all right without change bodies?"
The cat sniffs. "I'm wearing a real fur coat," it declares haughtily, "but no knickers." Then blinks out a fraction of a second
ahead of the snicker-snack of Bandersnatch-like jaws.
"Come on," says Pierre, standing up. "Time to see what Her Majesty wants with us today."

solar system are finally becoming visible on a cosmological scale.
There are about eleven billion future-shocked primates in various states of life and undeath throughout the
solar system. Most of them cluster where the interpersonal bandwidth is hottest, down in the water zone
around old Earth. Earth's biosphere has been in the intensive care ward for decades, weird rashes of
hot-burning replicators erupting across it before the World Health Organization can fix them – gray goo,
thylacines, dragons. The last great transglobal trade empire, run from the arcologies of Hong Kong, has
collapsed along with capitalism, rendered obsolete by a bunch of superior deterministic resource allocation
algorithms collectively known as Economics 2.0. Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Luna are all well on the way to
disintegration, mass pumped into orbit with energy stolen from the haze of free-flying thermoelectrics that
cluster so thickly around the solar poles that the sun resembles a fuzzy red ball of wool the size of a young
red giant.
Humans are just barely intelligent tool users; Darwinian evolutionary selection stopped when language and
tool use converged, leaving the average hairy meme carrier sadly deficient in smarts. Now the brightly
burning beacon of sapience isn't held by humans anymore – their cross-infectious enthusiasms have spread
to a myriad of other hosts, several types of which are qualitatively better at thinking. At last count, there
were about a thousand nonhuman intelligent species in Sol space, split evenly between posthumans on one
side, naturally self-organizing AIs in the middle, and mammalian nonhumans on the other. The common
mammal neural chassis is easily upgraded to human-style intelligence in most species that can carry, feed and
cool a half kilogram of gray matter, and the descendants of a hundred ethics-challenged doctoral theses are
now demanding equal rights. So are the unquiet dead; the panopticon-logged Net ghosts of people who lived
recently enough to imprint their identities on the information age, and the ambitious theological engineering
schemes of the Reformed Tiplerite Church of Latter-day Saints (who want to emulate all possible human
beings in real time, so that they can have the opportunity to be saved).
The human memesphere is coming alive, although how long it remains recognizably human is open to
question. The informational density of the inner planets is visibly converging on Avogadro's number of bits
per mole, one bit per atom, as the deconstructed dumb matter of the inner planets (apart from Earth,
preserved for now like a picturesque historic building stranded in an industrial park) is converted into
computronium. And it's not just the inner system. The same forces are at work on Jupiter's moons, and
those of Saturn, although it'll take thousands of years rather than mere decades to dismantle the gas giants
themselves. Even the entire solar energy budget isn't enough to pump Jupiter's enormous mass to orbital
velocity in less than centuries. The fast-burning primitive thinkers descended from the African plains apes may
have vanished completely or transcended their fleshy architecture before the solar Matrioshka brain is
finished.
It won't be long now ...
***

Meanwhile, there's a party brewing down in Saturn's well.
Sirhan's lily-pad city floats inside a gigantic and nearly-invisible sphere in Saturn's upper atmosphere; a balloon kilometers
across with a shell of fullerene-reinforced diamond below and a hot hydrogen gas bag above. It's one of several hundred
multimegaton soap bubbles floating in the sea of turbulent hydrogen and helium that is the upper atmosphere of Saturn,
seeded there by the Society for Creative Terraforming, subcontractors for the 2074 Worlds' Fair.
The cities are elegant, grown from a conceptual seed a few megawords long. Their replication rate is slow (it takes months to
build a bubble), but in only a couple of decades, exponential growth will have paved the stratosphere with human-friendly
terrain. Of course, the growth rate will slow toward the end, as it takes longer to fractionate the metal isotopes out of the
gas giant's turbid depths, but before that happens, the first fruits of the robot factories on Ganymede will be pouring
hydrocarbons down into the mix. Eventually Saturn – cloud-top gravity a human-friendly 11 meters per second squared –
will have a planet wide biosphere with nearly a hundred times the surface area of Earth. And a bloody good thing indeed
this will be, for otherwise, Saturn is no use to anyone except as a fusion fuel bunker for the deep future when the sun's
burned down.
This particular lily-pad is carpeted in grass, the hub of the disk rising in a gentle hill surmounted by the glowering concrete
hump of the Boston Museum of Science. It looks curiously naked, shorn of its backdrop of highways and the bridges of the
Charles River – but even the generous kiloton dumb matter load-outs of the skyhooks that lifted it into orbit wouldn't have
stretched to bringing its framing context along with it. Probably someone will knock up a cheap diorama backdrop out of
utility fog, Sirhan thinks, but for now, the museum stands proud and isolated, a solitary redoubt of classical learning in exile
from the fast-thinking core of the solar system.
"Waste of money," grumbles the woman in black. "Whose stupid idea was this, anyway?" She jabs the diamond ferrule of her
cane at the museum.
"It's a statement," Sirhan says absently. "You know the kind, we've got so many newtons to burn we can send our cultural
embassies wherever we like. The Louvre is on its way to Pluto, did you hear that?"
"Waste of energy." She lowers her cane reluctantly and leans on it. Pulls a face: "It's not right."

"You grew up during the second oil crunch, didn't you?" Sirhan prods. "What was it like then?"
"What was it ...? Oh, gas hit fifty bucks a gallon, but we still had plenty for bombers," she says dismissively. "We knew it would
be okay. If it hadn't been for those damn' meddlesome posthumanists –" Her wrinkled, unnaturally aged face scowls at him
furiously from underneath hair that has faded to the color of rotten straw, but he senses a subtext of self-deprecating irony
that he doesn't understand. "Like your grandfather, damn him. If I was young again I'd go and piss on his grave to show him
what I think of what he did. If he has a grave," she adds, almost fondly.
Memo checkpoint: log family history, Sirhan tells one of his ghosts. As a dedicated historian, he records every
experience routinely, both before it enters his narrative of consciousness – efferent signals are the cleanest – and also his
own stream of selfhood, against some future paucity of memory. But his grandmother has been remarkably consistent over
the decades in her refusal to adapt to the new modalities.
"You're recording this, aren't you?" she sniffs.
"I'm not recording it, Grandmama," he says gently, "I'm just preserving my memories for future generations."
"Hah! We'll see," she says suspiciously. Then she surprises him with a bark of laughter, cut off abruptly: "No, you'll see, darling.
I won't be around to be disappointed."
"Are you going to tell me about my grandfather?" asks Sirhan.
"Why should I bother? I know you posthumans, you'll just go and ask his ghost yourself. Don't try to deny it! There are two
sides to every story, child, and he's had more than his fair share of ears, the sleazebag. Leaving me to bring up your mother
on my own, and nothing but a bunch of worthless intellectual property and a dozen lawsuits from the Mafiya to do it with. I
don't know what I ever saw in him." Sirhan's voice-stress monitor detects a distinct hint of untruth in this assertion. "He's
worthless trash, and don't you forget it. Lazy idiot couldn't even form just one start-up on his own: He had to give it all
away, all the fruits of his genius."
While she rambles on, occasionally punctuating her characterization with sharp jabs of the cane, Pamela leads Sirhan on a
slow, wavering stroll that veers around one side of the museum, until they're standing next to a starkly engineered antique
loading bay. "He should have tried real communism instead," she harrumphs: "Put some steel into him, shake those
starry-eyed visionary positive-sum daydreams loose. You knew where you were in the old times, and no mistake. Humans
were real humans, work was real work, and corporations were just things that did as we told them. And then, when she
went to the bad, that was all his fault, too, you know."
"She? You mean my, ah, mother?" Sirhan diverts his primary sensorium back to Pamela's vengeful muttering. There are
aspects to this story that he isn't completely familiar with, angles he needs to sketch in so that he can satisfy himself that all is
as it should be when the bailiffs go in to repossess Amber's mind.
"He sent her our cat. Of all the mean-spirited, low, downright dishonest things he ever did, that was the worst part of it.
That cat was mine, but he reprogrammed it to lead her astray. And it succeeded admirably. She was only twelve at the time,
an impressionable age, I'm sure you'd agree. I was trying to raise her right. Children need moral absolutes, especially in a
changing world, even if they don't like it much at the time. Self-discipline and stability, you can't function as an adult without
them. I was afraid that, with all her upgrades, she'd never really get a handle on who she was, that she'd end up more
machine than woman. But Manfred never really understood childhood, mostly on account of his never growing up. He
always was inclined to meddle."
"Tell me about the cat," Sirhan says quietly. One glance at the loading bay door tells him that it's been serviced recently. A
thin patina of expended foglets have formed a snowy scab around its edges, flaking off like blue refractive candyfloss that
leaves bright metal behind. "Didn't it go missing or something?"
Pamela snorts. "When your mother ran away, it uploaded itself to her starwisp and deleted its body. It was the only one of
them that had the guts – or maybe it was afraid I'd have it subpoenaed as a hostile witness. Or, and I can't rule this out,
your grandfather gave it a suicide reflex. He was quite evil enough to do something like that, after he reprogrammed himself
to think I was some kind of mortal enemy."
"So when my mother died to avoid bankruptcy, the cat ... didn't stay behind? Not at all? How remarkable." Sirhan doesn't
bother adding how suicidal. Any artificial entity that's willing to upload its neural state vector into a one-kilogram interstellar
probe three-quarters of the way to Alpha Centauri without backup or some clear way of returning home has got to be
more than a few methods short in the object factory.
"It's a vengeful beast." Pamela pokes her stick at the ground sharply, mutters a command word, and lets go of it. She stands
before Sirhan, craning her neck back to look up at him. "My, what a tall boy you are."
"Person," he corrects, instinctively. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't presume."
"Person, thing, boy, whatever – you're engendered, aren't you?" she asks, sharply, waiting until he nods reluctantly. "Never
trust anyone who can't make up their mind whether to be a man or a woman," she says gloomily. "You can't rely on them."
Sirhan, who has placed his reproductive system on hold until he needs it, bites his tongue. "That damn cat," his grandmother
complains. "It carried your grandfather's business plan to my daughter and spirited her away into the big black. It poisoned
her against me. It encouraged her to join in that frenzy of speculative bubble-building that caused the market reboot that

brought down the Ring Imperium. And now it –"
"Is it on the ship?" Sirhan asks, almost too eagerly.
"It might be." She stares at him through narrowed eyes. "You want to interview it, too, huh?"
Sirhan doesn't bother denying it. "I'm a historian, Grandmama. And that probe has been somewhere no other human
sensorium has ever seen. It may be old news, and there may be old lawsuits waiting to feed on the occupants, but ..." He
shrugs. "Business is business, and my business lies in ruins."
"Hah!" She stares at him for a moment, then nods, very slowly. She leans forward to rest both wrinkled hands atop her cane,
joints like bags of shriveled walnuts: Her suit's endoskeleton creaks as it adjusts to accommodate her confidential posture.
"You'll get yours, kid." The wrinkles twist into a frightening smile, sixty years of saved-up bitterness finally within spitting
distance of a victim. "And I'll get what I want, too. Between us, your mother won't know what's hit her."
***
"Relax, between us your mother won't know what's hit her," says the cat, baring needle teeth at the Queen in the big chair –
carved out of a single lump of computational diamond, her fingers clenched whitely on the sapphire-plated arms – her
minions, lovers, friends, crew, shareholders, bloggers, and general factional auxiliaries spaced out around her. And the Slug.
"It's just another lawsuit. You can deal with it."
"Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke," Amber says, a trifle moodily. Although she's ruler of this embedded space, with total
control over the reality model underlying it, she's allowed herself to age to a dignified twentysomething: Dressed casually in
gray sweats, she doesn't look like the once-mighty ruler of a Jovian moon, or for that matter the renegade commander of a
bankrupt interstellar expedition. "Okay, I think you'd better run that past me again. Unless anyone's got any suggestions?"
"If you will excuse me?" asks Sadeq. "We have a shortage of insight here. I believe two laws were cited as absolute systemwide
conventions – and how they convinced the ulama to go along with that I would very much like to know – concerning the
rights and responsibilities of the undead. Which, apparently, we are. Did they by any chance attach the code to their claim?"
"Do bears shit in woods?" asks Boris, raptor-irascible, with an angry clatter of teeth. "Is full dependency graph and parse tree
of criminal code crawling way up carrier's ass as we speak. Am drowning in lawyer gibberish! If you –"
"Boris, can it!" Amber snaps. Tempers are high in the throne room. She didn't know what to expect when she arrived home
from the expedition to the router, but bankruptcy proceedings weren't part of it. She doubts any of them expected
anything like this. Especially not the bit about being declared liable for debts run up by a renegade splinter of herself, her
own un-uploaded identity that had stayed home to face the music, aged in the flesh, married, gone bankrupt, died – incurred
child support payments? "I don't hold you responsible for this," she added through gritted teeth, with a significant glance
toward Sadeq.
"This is truly a mess fit for the Prophet himself, peace be unto him, to serve judgment upon." Sadeq looks as shaken as she is
by the implications the lawsuit raises. His gaze skitters around the room, looking anywhere but at Amber – and Pierre, her
lanky toy-boy astrogator and bed warmer – as he laces his fingers.
"Drop it. I said I don't blame you." Amber forces a smile. "We're all tense from being locked in here with no bandwidth.
Anyway, I smell Mother-dearest's hand underneath all this litigation. Sniff the glove. We'll sort a way out."
"We could keep going." This from Ang, at the back of the room. Diffident and shy, she doesn't generally open her mouth
without a good reason. "The Field Circus is in good condition, isn't it? We could divert back to the beam from the
router, accelerate up to cruise speed, and look for somewhere to live. There must be a few suitable brown dwarfs within a
hundred light-years ..."
"We've lost too much sail mass," says Pierre. He's not meeting Amber's gaze either. There are lots of subtexts loose in this
room, broken narratives from stories of misguided affections. Amber pretends not to notice his embarrassment. "We ejected
half our original launch sail to provide the braking mirror at Hyundai +4904/ -56, and almost eight megaseconds ago, we
halved our area again to give us a final deceleration beam for Saturn orbit. If we did it again, we wouldn't have enough area
left to repeat the trick and still decelerate at our final target." Laser-boosted light sails do it with mirrors; after boost, they
can drop half the sail and use it to reverse the launch beam and direct it back at the ship, to provide deceleration. But you
can only do it a few times before you run out of sail. "There's nowhere to run."
"Nowhere to –" Amber stares at him through narrowed eyes. "Sometimes I really wonder about you, you know?"
"I know you do." And Pierre really does know, because he carries a little homunculoid around in his society of mind, a model
of Amber far more accurate and detailed than any pre-upload human could possibly have managed to construct of a lover.
(For her part, Amber keeps a little Pierre doll tucked away inside the creepy cobwebs of her head, part of an exchange of
insights they took part in years ago. But she doesn't try to fit inside his head too often anymore – it's not good to be able to
second-guess your lover every time.) "I also know that you're going to rush in and grab the bull by the, ah, no. Wrong
metaphor. This is your mother we are discussing?"
"My mother." Amber nods thoughtfully. "Where's Donna?"

"I don't –"
There's a throaty roar from the back, and Boris lurches forward with something in his mouth, an angry Bolex that flails his
snout with its tripod legs. "Hiding in corners again?" Amber says disdainfully.
"I am a camera!" protests the camera, aggrieved and self-conscious as it picks itself up off the floor. "I am –"
Pierre leans close, sticks his face up against the fish-eye lens: "You're fucking well going to be a human being just this once.
Merde!"
The camera is replaced by a very annoyed blond woman wearing a safari suit and more light meters, lenses, camera bags, and
microphones than a CNN outside broadcast unit. "Go fuck yourself!"
"I don't like being spied on," Amber says sharply. "Especially as you weren't invited to this meeting. Right?"
"I'm the archivist." Donna looks away, stubbornly refusing to admit anything. "You said I should –"
"Yes, well." Amber is embarrassed. But it's a bad idea to embarrass the Queen in her audience chamber. "You heard what we
were discussing. What do you know about my mother's state of mind?"
"Absolutely nothing," Donna says promptly. She's clearly in a sulk and prepared to do no more than the minimum to help
resolve the situation. "I only met her once. You look like her when you are angry, do you know that?"
"I –" For once, Amber's speechless.
"I'll schedule you for facial surgery," offers the cat. Sotto voce: "It's the only way to be sure."
Normally, accusing Amber of any resemblance to her mother, however slight and passing, would be enough to trigger a
reality quake within the upload environment that passes for the bridge of the Field Circus. It's a sign of how disturbed
Amber is by the lawsuit that she lets the cat's impertinence slide. "What is the lawsuit, anyway?" Donna asks, nosy as ever and
twice as annoying: "I did not that bit see."
"It's horrible," Amber says vehemently.
"Truly evil," echoes Pierre.
"Fascinating but wrong," Sadeq muses thoughtfully.
"But it's still horrible!"
"Yes, but what is it?" Donna the all-seeing-eye archivist and camera manqué asks.
"It's a demand for settlement." Amber takes a deep breath. "Dammit, you might as well tell everyone – it won't stay secret for
long." She sighs. "After we left, it seems my other half – my original incarnation, that is – got married. To Sadeq, here." She
nods at the Iranian theologian, who looks just as bemused as she did the first time she heard this part of the story. "And they
had a child. Then the Ring Imperium went bankrupt. The child is demanding maintenance payments from me, backdated
nearly twenty years, on the grounds that the undead are jointly and severally liable for debts run up by their incarnations.
It's a legal precedent established to prevent people from committing suicide temporarily as a way to avoid bankruptcy.
Worse, the lien on my assets is measured in subjective time from a point at the Ring Imperium about nineteen months after
our launch time – we've been in relativistic flight, so while my other half would be out from under it by now if she'd
survived, I'm still subject to the payment order. But compound interest applies back home – that is to stop people trying to
use the twin's paradox as a way to escape liability. So, by being away for about twenty-eight years of wall-clock time, I've run
up a debt I didn't know about to enormous levels.
"This man, this son I've never met, theoretically owns the Field Circus several times over. And my accounts are wiped out
– I don't even have enough money to download us into fleshbodies. Unless one of you guys has got a secret stash that
survived the market crash after we left, we're all in deep trouble."
***
A mahogany dining table eight meters long graces the flagstoned floor of the huge museum gallery, beneath the skeleton of
an enormous Argentinosaurus and a suspended antique Mercury capsule more than a century old. The dining table is
illuminated by candlelight, silver cutlery and fine porcelain plates setting out two places at opposite ends. Sirhan sits in a
high-backed chair beneath the shadow of a triceratops's rib cage. Opposite him, Pamela has dressed for dinner in the fashion
of her youth. She raises her wineglass toward him. "Tell me about your childhood, why don't you?" she asks. High above
them, Saturn's rings shimmer through the skylights, like a luminous paint splash thrown across the midnight sky.
Sirhan has misgivings about opening up to her, but consoles himself with the fact that she's clearly in no position to use
anything he tells her against him. "Which childhood would you like to know about?" he asks.
"What do you mean, which?" Her face creases up in a frown of perplexity.
"I had several. Mother kept hitting the reset switch, hoping I'd turn out better." It's his turn to frown.

"She did, did she," breathes Pamela, clearly noting it down to hold as ammunition against her errant daughter. "Why do you
think she did that?"
"It was the only way she knew to raise a child," Sirhan says defensively. "She didn't have any siblings. And, perhaps, she was
reacting against her own character flaws." When I have children there will be more than one, he tells himself smugly: when, that is,
he has adequate means to find himself a bride, and adequate emotional maturity to activate his organs of procreation. A
creature of extreme caution, Sirhan is not planning to repeat the errors of his ancestors on the maternal side.
Pamela flinches: "it's not my fault," she says quietly. "Her father had quite a bit to do with that. But what – what different
childhoods did you have?"
"Oh, a fair number. There was the default option, with Mother and Father arguing constantly – she refused to take the veil
and he was too stiff-necked to admit he was little more than a kept man, and between them, they were like two neutron stars
locked in an unstable death spiral of gravity. Then there were my other lives, forked and reintegrated, running in parallel. I
was a young goatherd in the days of the middle kingdom in Egypt, I remember that; and I was an all-American kid growing
up in Iowa in the 1950s, and another me got to live through the return of the hidden imam – at least, his parents thought
it was the hidden imam – and –" Sirhan shrugs. "Perhaps that's where I acquired my taste for history."
"Did your parents ever consider making you a little girl?" asks his grandmother.
"Mother suggested it a couple of times, but Father forbade it." Or rather, decided it was unlawful, he recalls. "I had a very
conservative upbringing in some ways."
"I wouldn't say that. When I was a little girl, that was all there was; none of these questions of self-selected identity. There was
no escape, merely escapism. Didn't you ever have a problem knowing who you were?"
The starters arrive, diced melon on a silver salver. Sirhan waits patiently for his grandmama to chivvy the table into serving
her. "The more people you are, the more you know who you are," says Sirhan. "You learn what it's like to be other people.
Father thought that perhaps it isn't good for a man to know too much about what it's like to be a woman." And Grandfather
disagreed, but you already know that, he adds for his own stream of consciousness.
"I couldn't agree more." Pamela smiles at him, an expression that might be that of a patronizing elder aunt if it wasn't for the
alarming sharkishness of her expression – or is it playfulness? Sirhan covers his confusion by spooning chunks of melon into
his mouth, forking temporary ghosts to peruse dusty etiquette manuals and warn him if he's about to commit some faux pas.
"So, how did you enjoy your childhoods?"
"Enjoy isn't a word I would use," he replies as evenly as he can, laying down his spoon so he doesn't spill anything. As if
childhood is something that ever ends, he thinks bitterly. Sirhan is considerably less than a gigasecond old and confidently
expects to exist for at least a terasecond – if not in exactly this molecular configuration, then at least in some reasonably
stable physical incarnation. And he has every intention of staying young for that entire vast span – even into the endless
petaseconds that might follow, although by then, megayears hence, he speculates that issues of neoteny will no longer interest
him. "It's not over yet. How about you? Are you enjoying your old age, Grandmama?"
Pamela almost flinches, but keeps iron control of her expression. The flush of blood in the capillaries of her cheeks, visible to
Sirhan through the tiny infrared eyes he keeps afloat in the air above the table, gives her away. "I made some mistakes in my
youth, but I'm enjoying it fine nowadays," she says lightly.
"It's your revenge, isn't it?" Sirhan asks, smiling and nodding as the table removes the entrees.
"Why, you little –" She stares at him rather than continuing. A very bleak stare it is, too. "What would you know about
revenge?" she asks.
"I'm the family historian." Sirhan smiles humorlessly. "I lived from two to seventeen years several hundred times over before
my eighteenth birthday. It was that reset switch, you know. I don't think Mother realized my primary stream of consciousness
was journaling everything."
"That's monstrous." Pamela picks up her wineglass and takes a sip to cover her confusion. Sirhan has no such retreat – grape
juice in a tumbler, unfermented, wets his tongue. "I'd never do something like that to any child of mine."
"So why won't you tell me about your childhood?" asks her grandson. "For the family history, of course."
"I'll –" She puts her glass down. "You intend to write one," she states.
"I'm thinking about it." Sirhan sits up. "An old-fashioned book covering three generations, living through interesting times,"
he suggests. "A work of postmodern history, the incoherent school at that – how do you document people who fork their
identities at random, spend years dead before reappearing on the stage, and have arguments with their own relativistically
preserved other copy? I could trace the history further, of course – if you tell me about your parents, although I am certain
they aren't around to answer questions directly – but we reach the boring dumb matter slope back to the primeval soup
surprisingly fast if we go there, don't we? So I thought that perhaps as a narrative hook I'd make the offstage viewpoint that
of the family's robot cat. (Except the bloody thing's gone missing, hasn't it?) Anyway, with so much of human history
occupying the untapped future, we historians have our work cut out recording the cursor of the present as it logs events.
So I might as well start at home."

"You're set on immortalism." Pamela studies his face.
"Yes," he says idly. "Frankly, I can understand your wanting to grow old out of a desire for revenge, but pardon me for
saying this, I have difficulty grasping your willingness to follow through with the procedure! Isn't it awfully painful?"
"Growing old is natural," growls the old woman. "When you've lived long enough for all your ambitions to be in ruins,
friendships broken, lovers forgotten or divorced acrimoniously, what's left to go on for? If you feel tired and old in spirit,
you might as well be tired and old in body. Anyway, wanting to live forever is immoral. Think of all the resources you're
taking up that younger people need! Even uploads face a finite data storage limit after a time. It's a monstrously egotistical
statement, to say you intend to live forever. And if there's one thing I believe in, it's public service. Duty: the obligation to
make way for the new. Duty and control."
Sirhan absorbs all this, nodding slowly to himself as the table serves up the main course – honey-glazed roast long pork with
sautéed potatoes a la gratin and carrots Debussy – when there's a loud bump from overhead.
"What's that?" Pamela asks querulously.
"One moment." Sirhan's vision splits into a hazy kaleidoscope view of the museum hall as he forks ghosts to monitor each of
the ubiquitous cameras. He frowns; something is moving on the balcony, between the Mercury capsule and a display of
antique random-dot stereoisograms. "Oh dear. Something seems to be loose in the museum."
"Loose? What do you mean, loose?" An inhuman shriek splits the air above the table, followed by a crash from upstairs.
Pamela stands up unsteadily, wiping her lips with her napkin. "Is it safe?"
"No, it isn't safe." Sirhan fumes. "It's disturbing my meal!" He looks up. A flash of orange fur shows over the balcony, then the
Mercury capsule wobbles violently on the end of its guy wires. Two arms and a bundle of rubbery something covered in
umber hair lurches out from the handrail and casually grabs hold of the priceless historical relic, then clambers inside and
squats on top of the dummy wearing Al Sheperd's age-cracked space suit. "It's an ape! City, I say, City! What's a monkey
doing loose in my dinner party?"
"I am most deeply sorry, sir, but I don't know. Would sir care to identify the monkey in question?" replies City, which for
reasons of privacy, has manifested itself as a bodiless voice.
There's a note of humor in City's tone that Sirhan takes deep exception to. "What do you mean? Can't you see it?" he
demands, focusing on the errant primate, which is holed up in the Mercury capsule dangling from the ceiling, smacking its
lips, rolling its eyes, and fingering the gasket around the capsule's open hatch. It hoots quietly to itself, then leans out of the
open door and moons over the table, baring its buttocks. "Get back!" Sirhan calls to his grandmother, then he gestures at
the air above the table, intending to tell the utility fog to congeal. Too late. The ape farts thunderously, then lets rip a stream
of excrement across the dining table. Pamela's face is a picture of wrinkled disgust as she holds her napkin in front of her
nose. "Dammit, solidify, will you!" Sirhan curses, but the ubiquitous misty pollen-grain-sized robots refuse to respond.
"What's your problem? Invisible monkeys?" asks City.
"Invisible –" he stops.
"Can't you see what it did?" Pamela demands, backing him up. "It just defecated all over the main course!"
"I see nothing," City says uncertainly.
"Here, let me help you." Sirhan lends it one of his eyes, rolls it to focus on the ape, which is now reaching lazy arms around
the hatch and patting down the roof of the capsule, as if hunting for the wires' attachment points.
"Oh dear," says City, "I've been hacked. That's not supposed to be possible."
"Well it fucking is," hisses Pamela.
"Hacked?" Sirhan stops trying to tell the air what to do and focuses on his clothing instead. Fabric reweaves itself instantly,
mapping itself into an armored airtight suit that raises a bubble visor from behind his neck and flips itself shut across his face.
"City please supply my grandmama with an environment suit now. Make it completely autonomous."
The air around Pamela begins to congeal in a blossom of crystalline security, as a sphere like a giant hamster ball precipitates
out around her. "If you've been hacked, the first question is, who did it," Sirhan states. "The second is 'why,' and the third is
'how.'" He edgily runs a self-test, but there's no sign of inconsistencies in his own identity matrix, and he has hot shadows
sleeping lightly at scattered nodes across as distance of half a dozen light-hours. Unlike pre-posthuman Pamela, he's effectively
immune to murder-simple. "If this is just a prank –"
Seconds have passed since the orang-utan got loose in the museum, and subsequent seconds have passed since City realized
its bitter circumstance. Seconds are long enough for huge waves of countermeasures to sweep the surface of the lily-pad
habitat. Invisibly small utility foglets are expanding and polymerizing into defenses throughout the air, trapping the thousands
of itinerant passenger pigeons in midflight, and locking down every building and every person who walks the paths outside.
City is self-testing its trusted computing base, starting with the most primitive secured kernel and working outward.
Meanwhile Sirhan, with blood in his eye, heads for the staircase, with the vague goal of physically attacking the intruder.
Pamela retreats at a fast roll, tumbling toward the safety of the mezzanine floor and a garden of fossils. "Who do you think

you are, barging in and shitting on my supper?" Sirhan yells as he bounds up the stairs. "I want an explanation! Right now!"
The orang-utan finds the nearest cable and gives it a yank, setting the one-ton capsule swinging. It bares its teeth at Sirhan in
a grin. "Remember me?" it asks, in a sibilant French accent.
"Remember –" Sirhan stops dead. "Tante Annette? What are you doing in that orangutan?"
"Having minor autonomic control problems." The ape grimaces wider, then bends one arm sinuously and scratches at its
armpit. "I am sorry, I installed myself in the wrong order. I was only meaning to say hello and pass on a message."
"What message?" Sirhan demands. "You've upset my grandmama, and if she finds out you're here –"
"She won't; I'll be gone in a minute." The ape – Annette – sits up. "Your grandfather salutes you and says he will be visiting
shortly. In the person, that is. He is very keen to meet your mother and her passengers. That is all. Have you a message for
him?"
"Isn't he dead?" Sirhan asks, dazed.
"No more than I am. And I'm overdue. Good day!" The ape swings hand over hand out of the capsule, then lets go and
plummets ten meters to the hard stone floor below. Its skull makes a noise like a hard-boiled egg impacting concrete.
"Oh dear," Sirhan breathes heavily. "City!"
"Yes, oh master?"
"Remove that body," he says, pointing over the balcony. "I'll trouble you not to disturb my grandmother with any details. In
particular, don't tell her it was Annette. The news may upset her." The perils of having a long-lived posthuman family, he thinks;
too many mad aunts in the space capsule. "If you can find a way to stop Auntie 'Nette from growing any more apes, that
might be a good idea." A thought strikes him. "By the way, do you know when my grandfather is due to arrive?"
"Your grandfather?" asks City: "Isn't he dead?"
Sirhan looks over the balcony, at the blood-seeping corpse of the intruder. "Not according to his second wife's latest
incarnation."
***
Funding the family reunion isn't going to be a problem, as Amber discovers when she receives an offer of reincarnation good
for all the passengers and crew of the Field Circus.
She isn't sure quite where the money is coming from. Presumably it's some creaky financial engine designed by Dad, stirring
from its bear-market bunker for the first time in decades to suck dusty syndication feeds and liquidate long-term assets held
against her return. She's duly grateful – even fervently so – for the details of her own impecunious position grow more
depressing the more she learns about them. Her sole asset is the Field Circus, a thirty-years-obsolete starwisp massing less
than twenty kilograms including what's left of its tattered sail, along with its cargo of uploaded passengers and crew. Without
the farsighted trust fund that has suddenly chugged into life, she'd be stranded in the realm of ever-circling leptons. But now
the fund has sent her its offer of incarnation, she's got a dilemma. Because one of the Field Circus's passengers has never
actually had a meatspace body ...
Amber finds the Slug browsing quietly in a transparent space filled with lazily waving branches that resemble violet coral fans.
They're a ghost-memory of alien life, an order of thermophilic quasi fungi with hyphae ridged in actin/myosin analogues,
muscular and slippery filter feeders that eat airborne unicellular organisms. The Slug itself is about two meters long and has a
lacy white exoskeleton of curves and arcs that don't repeat, disturbingly similar to a Penrose tiling. Chocolate brown organs
pulse slowly under the skeleton. The ground underfoot is dry but feels swampy.
Actually, the Slug is a surgical disguise. Both it and the quasi-fungal ecosystem have been extinct for millions of years, existing
only as cheap stage props in an interstellar medicine show run by rogue financial instruments. The Slug itself is one such
self-aware scam, probably a pyramid scheme or even an entire compressed junk bond market in heavy recession, trying to
hide from its creditors by masquerading as a life-form. But there's a problem with incarnating itself down in Sirhan's habitat
– the ecosystem it evolved for is a cool Venusiform, thirty atmospheres of saturated steam baked under a sky the color of
hot lead streaked with yellow sulphuric acid clouds. The ground is mushy because it's melting, not because it's damp.
"You're going to have to pick another somatotype," Amber explains, laboriously rolling her interface around the red-hot
coral reef like a giant soap bubble. The environmental interface is transparent and infinitely thin, a discontinuity in the
physics model of the simulation space, mapping signals between the human-friendly environment on one side and the
crushing, roasting hell on the other. "This one is simply not compatible with any of the supported environments where we're
going."
"I am not understanding. Surely I can integrate with the available worlds of our destination?"
"Uh, things don't work that way outside cyberspace." Suddenly Amber is at a bit of a loss. "The physics model could be
supported, but the energy input to do so would be prohibitive, and you would not be able to interact as easily with other
physics models as we can now." She forks a ghost, demonstrates a transient other-Amber in a refrigerated tank rolling across

the Slug's backyard, crushing coral and hissing and clanking noisily. "You'd be like this."
"Your reality is badly constructed, then," the Slug points out.
"It's not constructed at all, it just evolved, randomly." Amber shrugs. "We can't exercise the same level of control over the
underlying embedded context that we can over this one. I can't simply magic you an interface that will let you bathe in
steam at three hundred degrees."
"Why not?" asks the Slug. Translation wetware adds a nasty, sharp rising whine to the question, turning it into a demand.
"It's a privilege violation," Amber tries to explain. "The reality we're about to enter is, uh, provably consistent. It has to be,
because it's consistent and stable, and if we could create new local domains with different rules, they might propagate
uncontrollably. It's not a good idea, believe me. Do you want to come with us or not?"
"I have no alternative," the Slug says, slightly sulkily. "But do you have a body I can use?"
"I think –" Amber stops, suddenly. She snaps her fingers. "Hey, cat!"
A Cheshire grin ripples into view, masked into the domain wall between the two embedded realities. "Hey, human."
"Whoa!" Amber takes a backward step from the apparition. "Our friend here's got a problem, no suitable downloadable
body. Us meat puppets are all too closely tied to our neural ultrastructure, but you've got a shitload of programmable gate
arrays. Can we borrow some?"
"You can do better than that." Aineko yawns, gathering substance by the moment. The Slug is rearing up and backing away
like an alarmed sausage: Whatever it perceives in the membrane seems to frighten it. "I've been designing myself a new body. I
figured it was time to change my style for a while. Your corporate scam artist here can borrow my old template until
something better comes up. How's that?"
"Did you hear that?" Amber asks the Slug. "Aineko is kindly offering to donate her body to you. Will that do?" Without
waiting, she winks at her cat and taps her heels together, fading out with a whisper and a smile: "See you on the other side
..."
***
It takes several minutes for the Field Circus's antique transceiver to download the dozens of avabits occupied by the
frozen state vectors of each of the people running in its simulation engines. Tucked away with most of them is a resource
bundle consisting of their entire sequenced genome, a bunch of phenotypic and proteome hint markers, and a wish list of
upgrades. Between the gene maps and the hints, there's enough data to extrapolate a meat machine. So the festival city's
body shop goes to work turning out hacked stem cells and fabbing up incubators.
It doesn't take very long to reincarnate a starshipful of relativity-lagged humans these days. First, City carves out skeletons for
them (politely ignoring a crudely phrased request to cease and desist from Pamela, on the grounds that she has no power of
attorney), then squirts osteoclasts into the spongy ersatz bone. They look like ordinary human stem cells at a distance, but
instead of nuclei they have primitive pinpricks of computronium, blobs of smart matter so small they're as dumb as an
ancient Pentium, reading a control tape that is nevertheless better structured than anything Mother Nature evolved. These
heavily optimized fake stem cells – biological robots in all but name – spawn like cancer, ejecting short-lived anucleated
secondary cells. Then City infuses each mess of quasi-cancerous tissue with a metric shitload of carrier capsids, which deliver
the real cellular control mechanisms to their target bodies. Within a megasecond, the almost random churning of the
construction 'bots gives way to a more controlled process as nanoscale CPUs are replaced by ordinary nuclei and eject
themselves from their host cells, bailing out via the half-formed renal system – except for those in the central nervous system,
which have a final job to do. Eleven days after the invitation, the first passengers are being edited into the pattern of synaptic
junctions inside the newly minted skulls.
(This whole process is tediously slow and laughably obsolescent technology by the standards of the fast-moving core. Down
there, they'd just set up a wake shield in orbit, chill it down to a fractional Kelvin, whack two coherent matter beams
together, teleport some state information into place, and yank the suddenly materialized meatbody in through an airlock
before it has time to asphyxiate. But then again, down in the hot space, they don't have much room for flesh anymore ...)
Sirhan doesn't pay much attention to the pseudocancers fermenting and churning in the row of tanks that lines the Gallery
of the Human Body in the Bush wing of the museum. Newly formed, slowly unskeletonizing corpses – like a time-lapse
process of decay with a finger angrily twisting the dial into high-speed reverse – is both distasteful and aesthetically displeasing
to watch. Nor do the bodies tell him anything about their occupants. This sort of stuff is just a necessary prequel to the
main event, a formal reception and banquet to which he has devoted the full-time attention of four ghosts.
He could, given a few less inhibitions, go Dumpster-diving in their mental archives, but that's one of the big taboos of the
post-wetware age. (Spy agencies went meme-profiling and memory-mining in the third and fourth decades, gained a thought
police rap sheet, and spawned a backlash of deviant mental architectures resilient to infowar intrusions. Now the nations that
those spook institutions served no longer exist, their very landmasses being part of the orbiting nöosphere construction
project that will ultimately turn the mass of the entire solar system into a gigantic Matrioshka brain. And Sirhan is left with
an uneasy loyalty to the one great new taboo to be invented since the end of the twentieth century – freedom of thought.)

So, to indulge his curiosity, he spends most of his waking fleshbody hours with Pamela, asking her questions from time to
time and mapping the splenetic overspill of her memeome into his burgeoning family knowledge base.
"I wasn't always this bitter and cynical," Pamela explains, waving her cane in the vague direction of the cloudscape beyond
the edge of the world and fixing Sirhan with a beady stare. (He's brought her out here hoping that it will trigger another
cascade of memories, sunsets on honeymoon island resorts and the like, but all that seems to be coming up is bile.) "It was
the successive betrayals. Manfred was the first, and the worst in some ways, but that little bitch Amber hurt me more, if
anything. If you ever have children, be careful to hold something back for yourself; because if you don't, when they throw it
all in your face, you'll feel like dying. And when they're gone, you've got no way of patching things up."
"Is dying inevitable?" asks Sirhan, knowing damn well that it isn't, but more than happy to give her an excuse to pick at her
scabbed-over love wound: He more than half suspects she's still in love with Manfred. This is great family history, and he's
having the time of his flinty-hearted life leading her up to the threshold of the reunion he's hosting.
"Sometimes I think death is even more inevitable than taxes," his grandmother replies bleakly. "Humans don't live in a
vacuum; we're part of a larger pattern of life." She stares out across the troposphere of Saturn, where a thin rime of blown
methane snow catches the distant sunrise in a ruby-tinted fog. "The old gives way to the new," She sighs, and tugs at her
cuffs. (Ever since the incident with the gate crashing ape, she's taken to wearing an antique formal pressure suit, all clinging
black spidersilk woven with flexible pipes and silvery smart sensor nets.) "There's a time to get out of the way of the new, and
I think I passed it sometime ago."
"Um," says Sirhan, who is somewhat surprised by this new angle in her lengthy, self-justifying confession: "but what if you're
just saying this because you feel old? If it's just a physiological malfunction, we could fix it and you'd –"
"No! I've got a feeling that life prolongation is morally wrong, Sirhan. I'm not passing judgment on you, just stating that I think
it's wrong for me. It's immoral because it blocks up the natural order, keeps us old cobweb strands hanging around and
getting in you young things' way. And then there are the theological questions. If you try to live forever, you never get to
meet your maker."
"Your maker? Are you a theist, then?"
"I – think so." Pamela is silent for a minute. "Although there are so many different approaches to the subject that it's hard to
know which version to believe. For a long time, I was secretly afraid your grandfather might actually have had the answers.
That I might have been wrong all along. But now –" She leans on her cane. "When he announced that he was uploading, I
figured out that all he really had was a life-hating antihuman ideology he'd mistaken for a religion. The rapture of the nerds
and the heaven of the AIs. Sorry, no thanks; I don't buy it."
"Oh." Sirhan squints out at the cloudscape. For a moment, he thinks he can see something in the distant mist, an
indeterminate distance away – it's hard to distinguish centimeters from megameters, with no scale indicator and a horizon a
continental distance away – but he's not sure what it is. Maybe another city, mollusk-curved and sprouting antennae, a
strange tail of fabricator nodes wavering below and beneath it. Then a drift of cloud hides it for a moment, and, when it
clears the object is gone. "What's left, then? If you don't really believe in some kind of benign creator, dying must be
frightening. Especially as you're doing it so slowly."
Pamela smiles skeletally, a particularly humorless expression. "It's perfectly natural, darling! You don't need to believe in God
to believe in embedded realities. We use them every day, as mind tools. Apply anthropic reasoning and isn't it clear that our
entire universe is probably a simulation? We're living in the early epoch of the universe. Probably this" – she prods at the
spun-diamond inner wall of the bubble that holds in the precarious terrestrial atmosphere, holding out the howling
cryogenic hydrogen and methane gales of Saturn – "is but a simulation in some ancient history engine's panopticon,
rerunning the sum of all possible origins of sentience, a billion trillion megayears down the line. Death will be like waking up
as someone bigger, that's all." Her grin slides away. "And if not, I'll just be a silly old fool who deserves the oblivion she yearns
for."
"Oh, but –" Sirhan stops, his skin crawling. She may be mad, he realizes abruptly. Not clinically insane, just at odds with the entire
universe. Locked into a pathological view of her own role in reality. "I'd hoped for a reconciliation," he says quietly. "Your
extended family has lived through some extraordinary times. Why spoil it with acrimony?"
"Why spoil it?" She looks at him pityingly: "It was spoiled to begin with, dear, too much selfless sacrifice and too little
skepticism. If Manfred hadn't wanted so badly not to be human, and if I'd learned to be a bit more flexible in time, we might
still –" She trails off. "That's odd."
"What is?"
Pamela raises her cane and points out into the billowing methane thunderclouds, her expression puzzled. "I'll swear I saw a
lobster out there ..."

Amber awakens in the middle of the night in darkness and choking pressure, and senses that she's drowning. For a moment
she's back in the ambiguous space on the far side of the router, a horror of crawling instruments tracing her every
experience back to the nooks and crannies of her mind; then her lungs turn to glass and shatter, and she's coughing and
wheezing in the cold air of the museum at midnight.

The hard stone floor beneath her, and an odd pain in her knees, tells her that she's not aboard the Field Circus anymore.
Rough hands hold her shoulders up as she vomits a fine blue mist, racked by a coughing fit. More bluish liquid is oozing
from the pores of the skin on her arms and breasts, evaporating in strangely purposeful streamers. "Thank you," she finally
manages to gasp: "I can breathe now."
She sits back on her heels, realizes she's naked, and opens her eyes. Everything's confusingly strange, even though it shouldn't
be. There's a moment of resistance as if her eyelids are sealed – then they respond. It all feels strangely familiar to her, like
waking up again inside a house she grew up in and moved away from years ago. But the scene around her is hardly one to
inspire confidence. Shadows lie thick and deep across ovoid tanks filled with an anatomist's dream, bodies in various
nightmarish stages of assembly. And sitting in the middle of them, whence it has retreated after letting go of her shoulders, is
a strangely misshapen person – also nude, but for a patchy coat of orange hair.
"Are you awake yet, ma chérie?" asks the orang-utan.
"Um." Amber shakes her head, cautiously, feeling the drag of damp hair, the faint caress of a breeze – she reaches out with
another sense and tries to grab hold of reality, but it slithers away, intransigent and unembedded. Everything around her is
so solid and immutable that, for a moment, she feels a stab of claustrophobic panic: Help! I'm trapped in the real universe!
Another quick check reassures her that she's got access to something outside her own head, and the panic begins to subside:
Her exocortex has migrated successfully to this world. "I'm in a museum? On Saturn? Who are you – have we met?"
"Not in person," the ape says carefully. "We 'ave corresponded. Annette Dimarcos."
"Auntie –" A flood of memories rattle Amber's fragile stream of consciousness apart, forcing her to fork repeatedly until she
can drag them together. Annette, in a recorded message: Your father sends you this escape package. The legal key to her
mother's gilded custodial cage. Freedom a necessity. "Is Dad here?" she asks hopefully, even though she knows full well that
here in the real world at least thirty-five years have passed in linear time: In a century where ten years of linear time is
enough for several industrial revolutions, that's a lot of water under the bridge.
"I am not sure." The orang-utan blinks lazily, scratches at her left forearm, and glances round the chamber. "He might be in
one of these tanks, playing a shell game. Or he might be leaving well enough alone until the dust settles." She turns back to
stare at Amber with big, brown, soulful eyes. "This is not to be the reunion you were hoping for."
"Not –" Amber takes a deep breath, the tenth or twelfth that these new lungs have inspired: "What's with the body? You
used to be human. And what's going on?"
"I still am human, where it counts," says Annette. "I use these bodies because they are good in low gravity, and they remind
me that meatspace is no longer where I live. And for another reason." She gestures fluidly at the open door. "You will find
big changes. Your son has organized –"
"My son." Amber blinks. "Is this the one who's suing me? Which version of me? How long ago?" A torrent of questions stream
through her mind, exploding out into structured queries throughout the public sections of mindspace that she has access
to. Her eyes widen as she absorbs the implications. "Oh shit! Tell me she isn't here already!"
"I am very much afraid that she is," says Annette. "Sirhan is a strange child: He takes after his grandmère. Who he, of course,
invited to his party."
"His party?"
"Why, yes! Hasn't he told you what this is about? It's his party. To mark the opening of his special institution. The family
archive. He's setting the lawsuit aside, at least for the duration. That's why everybody is here – even me." The ape-body
smirks at her: "I'm afraid he's rather disappointed by my dress."
"Tell me about this library," Amber says, narrowing her eyes. "And about this son of mine whom I've never met, by a father
I've never fucked."
"What, you would know everything?" asks Annette.
"Yeah." Amber pushes herself creakily upright. "I need some clothes. And soft furniture. And where do I get a drink around
here?"
"I'll show you," says the orang-utan, unfolding herself in a vertical direction like a stack of orange furry inner tubes. "Drinks,
first."
***
While the Boston Museum of Science is the main structure on the lily-pad habitat, it's not the only one: just the stupidest,
composed of dumb matter left over from the pre-enlightened age. The orang-utan leads Amber through a service passage
and out into the temperate night, naked by ringlight. The grass is cool beneath her feet, and a gentle breeze blows constantly
out toward the recirculators at the edge of the worldlet. She follows the slouching orange ape up a grassy slope, under a
weeping willow, round a three-hundred-and-ninety-degree bend that flashes the world behind them into invisibility, and into
a house with walls of spun cloud stuff and a ceiling that rains moonlight.
"What is this?" Amber asks, entranced. "Some kind of aerogel?"

"No –" Annette belches, then digs a hand into the floor and pulls up a heap of mist. "Make a chair," she says. It solidifies,
gaining form and texture until a creditable Queen Anne reproduction stands in front of Amber on spindly legs. "And one
for me. Skin up, pick one of my favorite themes." The walls recede slightly and harden, extruding paint and wood and glass.
"That's it." The ape grins at Amber. "You are comfortable?"
"But I –" Amber stops. She glances at the familiar mantelpiece, the row of curios, the baby photographs forever glossy on
their dye-sub media. It's her childhood bedroom. "You brought the whole thing? Just for me?"
"You can never tell with future shock." Annette shrugs and reaches a limber arm around the back of her neck to scratch.
"We are utility fog using, for most purposes out here, peer-to-peer meshes of multiarmed assemblers that change
conformation and vapor/solid phase at command. Texture and color are all superfice, not reality. But yes, this came from
one of your mother's letters to your father. She brought it here, for you to surprise. If only it is ready in time." Lips pull
back from big, square, foliage-chewing teeth in something that might be a smile in a million years' time.
"You, I – I wasn't expecting. This." Amber realizes she's breathing rapidly, a near-panic reflex. The mere proximity of her
mother is enough to give her unpleasant reactions. Annette is all right, Annette is cool. And her father is the trickster-god,
always hiding in your blind spot to leap out and shower you with ambiguous gifts. But Pamela tried to mold Amber in her
own image as a child; and despite all the traveling she's done since then, and all the growing up, Amber harbors an
unreasonable claustrophobic fear of her mother.
"Don't be unhappy," Annette says warmly. "I this you show to convince you, she will try to disturb you. It is a sign of
weakness, she lacks the courage of her convictions."
"She does?" This is news to Amber, who leans forward to listen.
"Yes. She is an old and bitter woman, now. The years have not been easy for her. She perhaps intends to use her unrepaired
senescence as a passive suicide weapon by which to hold us blameworthy, inflicting guilt for her mistreatment, but she is
afraid of dying all the same. Your reaction, should it be unhappy, will excuse and encourage her selfishness. Sirhan colludes,
unknowing, the idiot child. He thinks the universe of her and thinks by helping her die he is helping her achieve her goals.
He has never met an adult walking backward toward a cliff before."
"Backward." Amber takes a deep breath. "You're telling me Mom is so unhappy she's trying to kill herself by growing old? Isn't
that a bit slow?"
Annette shakes her head lugubriously. "She's had fifty years to practice. You have been away twenty-eight years! She was
thirty when she bore you. Now she is over eighty, and a telomere refusenik, a charter member of the genome conservation
front. To accept a slow virus purge and aging reset would be to lay down a banner she has carried for half a century. To
accept uploading, that, too, is wrong in her mind: She will not admit her identity is a variable, not a constant. She came out
here in a can, frozen, with more radiation damage. She is not going back home. This is where she plans to end her days. Do
you see? That is why you were brought here. That, and because of the bailiffs who have bought title to your other self's
business debts. They are waiting for you in Jupiter system with warrants and headsuckers to extract your private keys."
"She's cornered me!"
"Oh, I would not say that. We all change our convictions sometime or other, perhaps. She is inflexible, she will not bend; but
she is not stupid. Nor is she as vindictive as perhaps she herself believes. She thinks she must a scorned woman be, even
though there is more to her than that. Your father and I, we –"
"Is he still alive?" Amber demands eagerly, half-anxious to know, half- wishing she could be sure the news won't be bad.
"Yes." Annette grins again, but it's not a happy expression, more a baring of teeth at the world. "As I was saying, your father
and I, we have tried to help her. Pamela denies him. He is, she says, not a man. No more so am I myself a woman? No, but
she'll still talk to me. You will do better. But his assets, they are spent. He is not a rich man this epoch, your father."
"Yeah, but." Amber nods to herself. "He may be able to help me."
"Oh? How so?"
"You remember the original goal of the Field Circus? The sapient alien transmission?"
"Yes, of course." Annette snorts. "Junk bond pyramid schemes from credulous saucer wisdom airheads."
Amber licks her lips. "How susceptible to interception are we here?"
"Here?" Annette glances round. "Very. You can't maintain a habitat in a nonbiosphere environment without ubiquitous
surveillance."
"Well, then ..."
Amber dives inward, forks her identity, collects a complex bundle of her thoughts and memories, marshals them, offers
Annette one end of an encryption tunnel, then stuffs the frozen mindstorm into her head. Annette sits still for
approximately ten seconds, then shudders and whimpers quietly. "You must ask your father," she says, growing visibly
agitated. "I must leave, now. I should not have known that! It is dynamite, you see. Political dynamite. I must return to my

primary sister-identity and warn her."
"Your – wait!" Amber stands up as fast as her ill-coordinated body will let her, but Annette is moving fast, swarming up a
translucent ladder in the air.
"Tell Manfred!" calls her aunt through the body of an ape: "Trust no one else!" She throws another packet of compressed,
encrypted memories down the tunnel to Amber; then, a moment later, the orange skull touches the ceiling and dissolves, a
liquid flow of dissociating utility foglets letting go of one another and dispersing into the greater mass of the building that
spawned the fake ape.

Snapshots from the family album: While you were gone ...
Amber, wearing a brocade gown and a crown encrusted with diamond processors and external neural taps, her
royal party gathered around her, attends the pan-Jovian constitutional conference with the majesty of a confirmed
head of state and ruler of a small inner moon. She smiles knowingly at the camera viewpoint, with the professional
shine that comes from a good public relations video filter. "We are very happy to be here," she says, "and we are
pleased that the commission has agreed to lend its weight to the continued progress of the Ring Imperium's
deep-space program."
A piece of dumb paper, crudely stained with letters written in a faded brown substance – possibly blood – says "I'm
checking out, don't delta me." This version of Pierre didn't go to the router: He stayed at home, deleted all his
backups, and slit his wrists, his epitaph sharp and self-inflicted. It comes as a cold shock, the first chill gust of winter's
gale blowing through the outer system's political elite. And it's the start of a regime of censorship directed toward
the already speeding starwisp: Amber, in her grief, makes an executive decision not to tell her embassy to the stars
that one of them is dead and, therefore, unique.
Manfred – fifty, with the fashionably pale complexion of the digerati, healthy-looking for his age, standing beside a
transmigration bush with a stupid grin on his face. He's decided to take the final step, not simply to spawn external
mental processes running in an exocortex of distributed processors, but to move his entire persona right out of
meatspace, into wherever it is that the uploads aboard the Field Circus have gone. Annette, skinny, elegant, and
very Parisian, stands beside him, looking as uncertain as the wife of a condemned man.
A wedding, shi'ite, Mut'ah – of limited duration. It's scandalous to many, but the mamtu'ah isn't moslem, she wears a
crown instead of a veil, and her groom is already spoken of in outraged terms by most other members of the
trans-Martian Islamic clergy. Besides which, in addition to being in love, the happy couple have more strategic
firepower than a late-twentieth-century superpower. Their cat, curled at their feet, looks smug: She's the custodian of
the permissive action locks on the big lasers.
A speck of ruby light against the darkness – red-shifted almost into the infrared, it's the return signal from the Field
Circus's light sail as the starwisp passes the one-light-year mark, almost twelve trillion kilometers out beyond Pluto.
(Although how can you call it a starwisp when it masses almost a hundred kilograms, including propulsion module?
Starwhisps are meant to be tiny!)
Collapse of the trans-Lunar economy: Deep in the hot thinking depths of the solar system, vast new intellects come
up with a new theory of wealth that optimizes resource allocation better than the previously pervasive Free Market
1.0. With no local minima to hamper them, and no need to spawn and reap start-ups Darwin-style, the companies,
group minds, and organizations that adopt the so-called Accelerated Salesman Infrastructure of Economics 2.0 trade
optimally with each other. The phase change accelerates as more and more entities join in, leveraging network
externalities to overtake the traditional ecosystem. Amber and Sadeq are late on the train, Sadeq obsessing about
how to reconcile ASI with murabaha and mudaraba while the postmodern economy of the mid-twenty-first century
disintegrates around them. Being late has punitive consequences – the Ring Imperium has always been a net importer
of brainpower and a net exporter of gravitational potential energy. Now it's a tired backwater, the bit rate from the
red-shifted relativisitic probe insufficiently delightful to obsess the daemons of industrial routing. In other words,
they're poor.
A message from beyond the grave: The travelers aboard the starship have reached their destination, an alien artifact
drifting in chilly orbit around a frozen brown dwarf. Recklessly they upload themselves into it, locking the starwisp
down for years of sleep. Amber and her husband have few funds with which to pay for the propulsion lasers: what
they have left of the kinetic energy of the Ring Imperium – based on the orbital momentum of a small Jovian inner
moon – is being sapped, fast, at a near-loss, by the crude requirements of the exobionts and metanthropes who fork
and spawn in the datasphere of the outer Jovians. The cost of importing brains to the Ring Imperium is steep: In
near-despair Amber and Sadeq produce a child, Generation 3.0, to populate their dwindling kingdom. Picture the
cat, offended, lashing its tail beside the zero-gee crib.
Surprise and postcards from the inner orbitals – Amber's mother offers to help. For the sake of the child, Sadeq
offers bandwidth and user interface enrichment. The child forks, numerous times, as Amber despairingly plays with
probabilities, simulating upbringing outcomes. Neither she nor Sadeq are good parents – the father absent-minded
and prone to lose himself in the intertextual deconstruction of surahs, the mother ragged-edged from running the
economy of a small and failing kingdom. In the space of a decade, Sirhan lives a dozen lives, discarding identities like
old clothes. The uncertainty of life in the decaying Ring Imperium does not entrance him, his parents' obsessions
annoy him, and when his grandmother offers to fund his delta vee and subsequent education in one of the orbitals
around Titan, his parents give their reluctant assent.
Amber and Sadeq separate acrimoniously. Sadeq, studies abandoned in the face of increasing intrusions from the
world of what is into the universe of what should be, joins a spacelike sect of sufis, encysted in a matrix of vitrification
nanomechs out in the Oort cloud to await a better epoch. His instrument of will – the legal mechanism of his
resurrection – specifies that he is waiting for the return of the hidden, twelfth imam.

For her part, Amber searches the inner system briefly for word of her father – but there's nothing. Isolated and
alone, pursued by accusing debts, she flings herself into a reborganization, stripping away those aspects of her
personality that have brought her low; in law, her liability is tied to her identity. Eventually she donates herself to a
commune of also-rans, accepting their personality in return for a total break with the past.
Without Queen and consort, the Ring Imperium – now unmanned, leaking breathing gases, running on autonomic
control – slowly deorbits into the Jovian murk, beaming power to the outer moons until it punches a hole in the
cloud deck in a final incandescent smear of light, the like of which has not been seen since the Shoemaker-Levy 9
impact.
Sirhan, engrossed in Saturnalia, is offended by his parents' failure to make more of themselves. And he resolves to do
it for them, if not necessarily in a manner of their liking.
***

"You see, I am hoping you will help me with my history project," says the serious-faced young man.
"History project." Pierre follows him along the curving gallery, hands clasped behind his back self-consciously to keep from
showing his agitation: "What history is this?"
"The history of the twenty-first century," says Sirhan. "You remember it, don't you?"
"Remember it –" Pierre pauses. "You're serious?"
"Yes." Sirhan opens a side door. "This way, please. I'll explain."
The door opens onto what used to be one of the side galleries of the museum building, full of interactive exhibits designed to
explain elementary optics to hyperactive children and their indulgent parental units. Traditional optics are long since
obsolete – tunable matter can slow photons to a stop, teleport them here to there, play ping-pong with spin and
polarization – and besides, the dumb matter in the walls and floor has been replaced by low-power computronium, heat
sinks dangling far below the floor of the lily-pad habitat to dispose of the scanty waste photons from reversible computation.
Now the room is empty.
"Since I became curator here, I've turned the museum's structural supports into a dedicated high-density memory store. One
of the fringe benefits of a supervisory post, of course. I have about a billion avabits of capacity, enough to archive the
combined sensory bandwidth and memories of the entire population of twentieth-century Earth – if that was what interested
me."
Slowly the walls and ceiling are coming to life, brightening, providing a dizzyingly vibrant view of dawn over the rim wall of
Meteor Crater, Arizona – or maybe it's downtown Baghdad.
"Once I realized how my mother had squandered the family fortune, I spent some time looking for a solution to the
problem," Sirhan continues. "And it struck me, then, that there's only one commodity that is going to appreciate in value as
time continues: reversibility."
"Reversibility? That doesn't make much sense." Pierre shakes his head. He still feels slightly dizzy from his decanting. He's only
been awake an hour or so and is still getting used to the vagaries of a universe that doesn't bend its rules to fit his whim of
iron – that, and worrying about Amber, of whom there is no sign in the hall of growing bodies. "Excuse me, please, but do
you know where Amber is?"
"Hiding, probably," Sirhan says, without rancor. "Her mother's about," he adds. "Why do you ask?"
"I don't know what you know about us." Pierre looks at him askance: "We were aboard the Field Circus for a long time."
"Oh, don't worry on my behalf. I know you're not the same people who stayed behind to contribute to the Ring Imperium's
collapse," Sirhan says dismissively, while Pierre hastily spawns a couple of ghosts to search for the history he's alluding to.
What they discover shocks him to the core as they integrate with his conscious narrative.
"We didn't know about any of that!" Pierre crosses his arms defensively. "Not about you, or your father either," he adds
quietly. "Or my other ... life." Shocked: Did I kill myself? Why would I do a thing like that? Nor can he imagine what Amber
might see in an introverted cleric like Sadeq; not that he wants to.
"I'm sure this must come as a big shock to you," Sirhan says condescendingly, "but it's all to do with what I was talking about.
Reversibility. What does it mean to you, in your precious context? You are, if you like, an opportunity to reverse whatever ill
fortune made your primary instance autodarwinate himself. He destroyed all the back-ups he could get his ghosts to ferret
out, you know. Only a light-year delay line and the fact that as a running instance you're technically a different person saved
you. And now, you're alive, and he's dead – and whatever made him kill himself doesn't apply to you. Think of it as natural
selection among different versions of yourself. The fittest version of you survives."
He points at the wall of the crater. A tree diagram begins to grow from the bottom left corner of the wall, recurving and
recomplicating as it climbs toward the top right, zooming and fracturing into taxonomic fault lines. "Life on Earth, the family
tree, what paleontology has been able to deduce of it for us," he says pompously. "The vertebrates begin there" – a point
three quarters of the way up the tree – "and we've got an average of a hundred fossil samples per megayear from then on.
Most of them collected in the past two decades, as exhaustive mapping of the Earth's crust and upper mantle at the

micrometer level has become practical. What a waste."
"That's" – Pierre does a quick sum – "fifty thousand different species? Is there a problem?"
"Yes!" Sirhan says vehemently, no longer aloof or distant. He struggles visibly to get himself under control. "At the beginning
of the twentieth century, there were roughly two million species of vertebrate and an estimated thirty or so million species of
multicellular organisms – it's hard to apply the same statistical treatment to prokaryotes, but doubtless there were huge
numbers of them, too. The average life span of a species is about five megayears. It used to be thought to be about one, but
that's a very vertebrate-oriented estimate – many insect species are stable over deep time. Anyway, we have a total sample,
from all of history, of only fifty thousand known prehistoric species – out of a population of thirty million, turning over
every five million years. That is, we know of only one in a million life-forms, of those that ever existed on Earth. And the
situation with human history is even worse."
"Aha! So you're after memories, yes? What really happened when we colonized Barney. Who released Oscar's toads in the
free-fall core of the Ernst Sanger, that sort of thing?"
"Not exactly." Sirhan looks pained, as if being forced to spell it out devalues the significance of his insight. "I'm after history. All
of it. I intend to corner the history futures market. But I need my grandfather's help – and you're here to help me get it."
***
Over the course of the day, various refugees from the Field Circus hatch from their tanks and blink in the ringlight,
stranded creatures from an earlier age. The inner system is a vague blur from this distance, a swollen red cloud masking the
sun that rides high above the horizon. However, the great restructuring is still visible to the naked eye – here, in the shape
of the rings, which show a disturbingly organized fractal structure as they whirl in orbit overhead. Sirhan (or whoever is
paying for this celebration of family flesh) has provided for their physical needs: food, water, clothes, housing and bandwidth,
they're all copiously available. A small town of bubble homes grows on the grassy knoll adjacent to the museum, utility foglets
condensing in a variety of shapes and styles.
Sirhan isn't the only inhabitant of the festival city, but the others keep themselves to themselves. Only bourgeois isolationists
and reclusive weirdoes would want to live out here right now, with whole light-minutes between themselves and the rest of
civilization. The network of lily-pad habitats isn't yet ready for the Saturnalian immigration wave that will break upon this
alien shore when it's time for the Worlds' Fair, a decade or more in the future. Amber's flying circus has driven the native
recluses underground, in some cases literally: Sirhan's neighbor, Vinca Kovic, after complaining bitterly about the bustle and
noise ("Forty immigrants! An outrage!"), has wrapped himself in an environment pod and is estivating at the end of a
spider-silk cable a kilometer beneath the space-frame underpinnings of the city.
But that isn't going to stop Sirhan from organizing a reception for the visitors. He's moved his magnificent dining table
outside, along with the Argentinosaurus skeleton. In fact, he's built a dining room within the dinosaur's rib cage. Not that
he's planning on showing his full hand, but it'll be interesting to see how his guests respond. And maybe it'll flush out the
mystery benefactor who's been paying for all these meatbodies.
Sirhan's agents politely invite his visitors to the party as the second sunset in this day cycle gently darkens the sky to violet.
He discusses his plans with Pamela via antique voice-only phone as his silent valet dresses him with inhuman grace and
efficiency. "I'm sure they'll listen when the situation is made clear to them," he says. "If not, well, they'll soon find out what it
means to be paupers under Economics 2.0. No access to multiplicity, no willpower, to be limited to purely spacelike
resources, at the mercy of predatory borganisms and metareligions – it's no picnic out there!"
"You don't have the resources to set this up on your own," his grandmother points out in dry, didactic tones. "If this was
the old economy, you could draw on the infrastructure of banks, insurers, and other risk management mechanisms –"
"There's no risk to this venture, in purely human terms," Sirhan insists. "The only risk is starting it up with such a limited
reserve."
"You win some, you lose some," Pamela points out. "Let me see you." With a sigh, Sirhan waves at a frozen camera; it blinks,
surprised. "Hey, you look good! Every inch the traditional family entrepreneur. I'm proud of you, darling."
Blinking back an unaccustomed tear of pride, Sirhan nods. "I'll see you in a few minutes," he says, and cuts the call. To the
nearest valet: "Bring my carriage, now."
A rippling cloud of utility foglets, constantly connecting and disconnecting in the hazy outline of a 1910-vintage Rolls Royce
Silver Ghost, bears Sirhan silently away from his wing of the museum. It drives him out onto the sunset path around the
building, over to the sunken amphitheatre, where the mounted skeleton of the Argentinosaurus stands like a half-melted
columnar sculpture beneath the orange-and-silver ringlight. A small crowd of people are already present, some dressed
casually and some attired in the formal garb of earlier decades. Most of them are passengers or crew recently decanted from
the starwisp, but a handful are wary-eyed hermits, their body language defensive and their persons the focus of a constant
orbital hum of security bees. Sirhan dismounts from his silvery car and magics it into dissolution, a haze of foglets dispersing
on the breeze. "Welcome to my abode," he says, bowing gravely to a ring of interested faces. "My name is Sirhan
al-Khurasani, and I am the prime contractor in charge of this small corner of the temporary Saturn terraforming project. As
some of you probably know, I am related by blood and design to your former captain, Amber Macx. I'd like to offer you the
comforts of my home while you acclimatize yourselves to the changed circumstances prevailing in the system at large and
work out where you want to go next."

He walks toward the front of the U-shaped table of solidified air that floats beneath the dead dinosaur's rib cage, slowly turns
to take in faces, and blinks down captions to remind him who's who in this gathering. He frowns slightly; there's no sign of
his mother. But that wiry fellow, with the beard – surely that can't be – "Father?" he asks.
Sadeq blinks owlishly. "Have we met?"
"Possibly not." Sirhan can feel his head spinning, because although Sadeq looks like a younger version of his father, there's
something wrong – some essential disconnect: the politely solicitous expression, the complete lack of engagement, the absence
of paternal involvement. This Sadeq has never held the infant Sirhan in the control core of the Ring's axial cylinder, never
pointed out the spiral storm raking vast Jupiter's face and told him stories of djinni and marvels to make a boy's hair stand
on end. "I won't hold it against you, I promise," he blurts.
Sadeq raises an eyebrow but passes no comment, leaving Sirhan at the center of an uncomfortable silence. "Well then," he
says hastily. "If you would like to help yourselves to food and drink, there'll be plenty of time to talk later." Sirhan doesn't
believe in forking ghosts simply to interact with other people – the possibilities for confusion are embarrassing – but he's
going to be busy working the party.
He glances round. Here's a bald, aggressive-looking fellow, beetle-browed, wearing what looks like a pair of cut-offs and a top
made by deconstructing a space suit. Who's he? (Sirhan's agents hint: "Boris Denisovitch." But what does that mean?) There's
an amused-looking older woman, a beady-eyed camera painted in the violent colors of a bird of paradise riding her
shoulder. Behind her a younger woman, dressed head to toe in clinging black, her currently ash-blonde hair braided in
cornrows, watches him – as does Pierre, a protective arm around her shoulders. They're – Amber Macx? That's his mother?
She looks far too young, too much in love with Pierre. "Amber!" he says, approaching the couple.
"Yeah? You're, uh, my mystery child-support litigant?" Her smile is distinctly unfriendly as she continues: "Can't say I'm
entirely pleased to meet you, under the circumstances, although I should thank you for the spread."
"I –" His tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. "It's not like that."
"What's it supposed to be like?" she asks sharply. jabbing a finger at him: "You know damn well I'm not your mother. So
what's it all about, huh? You know damn well I'm nearly bankrupt, too, so it's not as if you're after my pocket lint. What do
you want from me?"
Her vehemence takes him aback. This sharp-edged aggressive woman isn't his mother, and the introverted cleric – believer –
on the other side isn't his father, either. "I ha-ha-had to stop you heading for the inner system," he says, speech center
hitting deadlock before his antistutter mod can cut in. "They'll eat you alive down there. Your other half left behind
substantial debts, and they've been bought up by the most predatory – "
"Runaway corporate instruments," she states, calmly enough. "Fully sentient and self-directed."
"How did you know?" he asks, worried.
She looks grim. "I've met them before." It's a very familiar grim expression, one he knows intimately, and that feels wrong
coming from this near stranger. "We visited some weird places, while we were away." She glances past him, focuses on
someone else, and breathes in sharply as her face goes blank. "Quickly, tell me what your scheme is. Before Mom gets here."
"Mind archiving and history mergers. Back yourself up, pick different life courses, see which ones work and which don't – no
need to be a failure, just hit the 'reload game' icon and resume. That and a long-term angle on the history futures market. I
need your help," he babbles. "It won't work without family, and I'm trying to stop her killing herself –"
"Family." She nods, guardedly, and Sirhan notices her companion, this Pierre – not the weak link that broke back before he
was born, but a tough-eyed explorer newly returned from the wilderness – sizing him up. Sirhan's got one or two tricks up
his exocortex, and he can see the haze of ghost-shapes around Pierre; his data-mining technique is crude and out-of-date,
but enthusiastic and not without a certain flair. "Family," Amber repeats, and it's like a curse. Louder: "Hello, Mom. Should
have guessed he'd have invited you here, too."
"Guess again." Sirhan glances round at Pamela, then back at Amber, suddenly feeling very much like a rat trapped between a
pair of angry cobras. Leaning on her cane, wearing discreet cosmetics and with her medical supports concealed beneath an
old-fashioned dress, Pamela could be a badly preserved sixtysomething from the old days instead of the ghastly slow suicide
case that her condition amounts to today. She smiles politely at Amber. "You may remember me telling you that a lady never
unintentionally causes offense. I didn't want to offend Sirhan by turning up in spite of his wishes, so I didn't give him a chance
to say no."
"And this is supposed to earn you a sympathy fuck?" Amber drawls. "I'd expected better of you."
"Why, you –" The fire in her eyes dies suddenly, subjected to the freezing pressure of a control that only comes with age. "I'd
hoped getting away from it all would have improved your disposition, if not your manners, but evidently not." Pamela jabs
her cane at the table: "Let me repeat, this is your son's idea. Why don't you eat something?"
"Poison tester goes first." Amber smiles slyly.
"For fuck's sake!" It's the first thing Pierre has said so far, and crude or not, it comes as a profound relief when he steps

forward, picks up a plate of water biscuits loaded with salmon caviar, and puts one in his mouth. "Can't you guys leave the
back stabbing until the rest of us have filled our stomachs? 'S not as if I can turn down the biophysics model in here." He
shoves the plate at Sirhan. "Go on, it's yours."
The spell is broken. "Thank you," Sirhan says gravely, taking a cracker and feeling the tension fall as Amber and her mother
stop preparing to nuke each other and focus on the issue at hand – which is that food comes before fighting at any social
event, not vice versa.
"You might enjoy the egg mayonnaise, too," Sirhan hears himself saying: "It goes a long way to explaining why the dodo
became extinct first time around."
"Dodoes." Amber keeps one eye warily on her mother as she accepts a plate from a silently gliding silver bush-shaped
waitron. "What was that about the family investment project?" she asks.
"Just that without your cooperation your family will likely go the way of the bird," her mother cuts in before Sirhan can
muster a reply. "Not that I expect you to care."
Boris butts in. "Core worlds are teeming with corporates. Is bad business for us, good business for them. If you are seeing
what we are seen –"
"Don't remember you being there," Pierre says grumpily.
"In any event," Sirhan says smoothly, "the core isn't healthy for us one-time fleshbodies anymore. There are still lots of people
there, but the ones who uploaded expecting a boom economy were sadly disappointed. Originality is at a premium, and the
human neural architecture isn't optimized for it – we are, by disposition, a conservative species, because in a static
ecosystem, that provides the best return on sunk reproductive investment costs. Yes, we change over time – we're more
flexible than almost any other animal species to arise on Earth – but we're like granite statues compared to organisms
adapted to life under Economics 2.0."
"You tell 'em, boy," Pamela chirps, almost mockingly. "It wasn't that bloodless when I lived through it." Amber casts her a
cool stare.
"Where was I?" Sirhan snaps his fingers, and a glass of fizzy grape juice appears between them. "Early upload entrepreneurs
forked repeatedly, discovered they could scale linearly to occupy processor capacity proportional to the mass of
computronium available, and that computationally trivial tasks became tractable. They could also run faster, or slower, than
real time. But they were still human, and unable to operate effectively outside human constraints. Take a human being and
bolt on extensions that let them take full advantage of Economics 2.0, and you essentially break their narrative chain of
consciousness, replacing it with a journal file of bid/request transactions between various agents; it's incredibly efficient and
flexible, but it isn't a conscious human being in any recognizable sense of the word."
"All right," Pierre says slowly. "I think we've seen something like that ourselves. At the router."
Sirhan nods, not sure whether he's referring to anything important. "So you see, there are limits to human progress – but
not to progress itself! The uploads found their labor to be a permanently deflating commodity once they hit their point of
diminishing utility. Capitalism doesn't have a lot to say about workers whose skills are obsolete, other than that they should
invest wisely while they're earning and maybe retrain: but just knowing how to invest in Economics 2.0 is beyond an
unaugmented human. You can't retrain as a seagull, can you, and it's quite as hard to retool for Economics 2.0. Earth is –"
He shudders.
"There's a phrase I used to hear in the old days," Pamela says calmly, "ethnic cleansing. Do you know what that means,
darling idiot daughter? You take people who you define as being of little worth, and first you herd them into a crowded
ghetto with limited resources, then you decide those resources aren't worth spending on them, and bullets are cheaper than
bread. 'Mind children' the extropians called the posthumans, but they were more like Vile Offspring. There was a lot of that,
during the fast sigmoid phase. Starving among plenty, compulsory conversions, the very antithesis of everything your father
said he wanted ..."
"I don't believe it," Amber says hotly. "That's crazy! We can't go the way of –"
"Since when has human history been anything else?" asks the woman with the camera on her shoulder – Donna, being some
sort of public archivist, is in Sirhan's estimate likely to be of use to him. "Remember what we found in the DMZ?"
"The DMZ?" Sirhan asks, momentarily confused.
"After we went through the router," Pierre says grimly. "You tell him, love." He looks at Amber.
Sirhan, watching him, feels it fall into place at that moment, a sense that he's stepped into an alternate universe, one where
the woman who might have been his mother isn't, where black is white, his kindly grandmother is the wicked witch of the
west, and his feckless grandfather is a farsighted visionary.
"We uploaded via the router," Amber says, and looks confused for a moment. "There's a network on the other side of it. We
were told it was FTL, instantaneous, but I'm not so sure now. I think it's something more complicated, like a lightspeed
network, parts of which are threaded through wormholes that make it look FTL from our perspective. Anyway, Matrioshka

brains, the end product of a technological singularity – they're bandwidth-limited. Sooner or later the posthuman
descendants evolve Economics 2.0, or 3.0, or something else and it, uh, eats the original conscious instigators. Or uses them
as currency or something. The end result we found is a howling wilderness of degenerate data, fractally compressed,
postconscious processes running slower and slower as they trade storage space for processing power. We were" – she licks
her lips – "lucky to escape with our minds. We only did it because of a friend. It's like the main sequence in stellar evolution;
once a G-type star starts burning helium and expands into a red giant, it's 'game over' for life in what used to be its
liquid-water zone. Conscious civilizations sooner or later convert all their available mass into computronium, powered by
solar output. They don't go interstellar because they want to stay near the core where the bandwidth is high and latency is
low, and sooner or later, competition for resources hatches a new level of metacompetition that obsoletes them."
"That sounds plausible," Sirhan says slowly. He puts his glass down and chews distractedly on one knuckle. "I thought it was a
low-probability outcome, but ..."
"I've been saying all along, your grandfather's ideas would backfire in the end," Pamela says pointedly.
"But –" Amber shakes her head. "There's more to it than that, isn't there?"
"Probably," Sirhan says, then shuts up.
"So are you going to tell us?" asks Pierre, looking annoyed. "What's the big idea, here?"
"An archive store," Sirhan says, deciding that this is the right time for his pitch. "At the lowest level, you can store back-ups
of yourself here. So far so good, eh? But there's a bit more to it than that. I'm planning to offer a bunch of embedded
universes – big, running faster than real-time – sized and scoped to let human-equivalent intelligences do what-if modeling
on themselves. Like forking off ghosts of yourself, but much more so – give them whole years to diverge, learn new skills, and
evaluate them against market requirements, before deciding which version of you is most suited to run in the real world. I
mentioned the retraining paradox. Think of this as a solution for level one, human-equivalent, intelligences. But that's just the
short-term business model. Long-term, I want to acquire a total lock on the history futures market by having a complete
archive of human experiences, from the dawn of the fifth singularity on up. No more unknown extinct species. That should
give us something to trade with the next-generation intelligences – the ones who aren't our mind children and barely
remember us. At the very least, it gives us a chance to live again, a long way out in deep time. Alternatively, it can be turned
into a lifeboat. If we can't compete with our creations, at least we've got somewhere to flee, those of us who want to. I've got
agents working on a comet, out in the Oort cloud – we could move the archive to it, turn it into a generation ship with
room for billions of evacuees running much slower than real-time in archive space until we find a new world to settle."
"Is not sounding good to me," Boris comments. He spares a worried glance for an oriental-looking woman who is watching
their debate silently from the fringe.
"Has it really gone that far?" asks Amber.
"There are bailiffs hunting you in the inner system," Pamela says bluntly. "After your bankruptcy proceedings, various
corporates got the idea that you might be concealing something. The theory was that you were insane to take such a huge
gamble on the mere possibility of there being an alien artifact within a few light-years of home, so you had to have
information above and beyond what you disclosed. Theories include your cat – hardware tokens were in vogue in the fifties
– being the key to a suite of deposit accounts; the fuss mainly died down after Economics 2.0 took over, but some fairly
sleazy conspiracy freaks refuse to let go."
She grins, frighteningly. "Which is why I suggested to your son that he make you an offer you can't refuse."
"What's that?" asks a voice from below knee level.
Pamela looks down, an expression of deep distaste on her face. "Why should I tell you?" she asks, leaning on her cane: "After
the disgraceful way you repaid my hospitality! All you've got coming from me is a good kicking. If only my knee was up to the
job."
The cat arches its back: Its tail fluffs out with fear as its hair stands on end, and it takes Amber a moment to realize that it
isn't responding to Pamela, but to something behind the old woman. "Through the domain wall. Outside this biome. So cold.
What's that?"
Amber turns to follow the cat's gaze, and her jaw drops. "Were you expecting visitors?" she asks Sirhan, shakily.
"Visit –" He looks round to see what everybody's gaping at and freezes. The horizon is brightening with a false dawn: the
fusion spark of a de-orbiting spacecraft.
"It's bailiffs," says Pamela, head cocked to one side as if listening to an antique bone-conduction earpiece. "They've come for
your memories, dear," she explains, frowning. "They say we've got five kiloseconds to surrender everything. Otherwise,
they're going to blow us apart ..."

"You're all in big trouble," says the orang-utan, sliding gracefully down one enormous rib to land in an ungainly heap in
front of Sirhan.

Sirhan recoils in disgust. "You again! What do you want from me this time?"
"Nothing." The ape ignores him: "Amber, it is time for you to call your father."
"Yeah, but will he come when I call?" Amber stares at the ape. Her pupils expand: "Hey, you're not my –"
"You." Sirhan glares at the ape. "Go away! I didn't invite you here!"
"More unwelcome visitors?" asks Pamela, raising an eyebrow.
"Yes, you did." The ape grins at Amber, then crouches down, hoots quietly and beckons to the cat, who is hiding behind one
of the graceful silver servitors.
"Manfred isn't welcome here. And neither is that woman," Sirhan swears. He catches Pamela's eye: "Did you know anything
about this? Or about the bailiffs?" He gestures at the window, beyond which the drive flare casts jagged shadows. It's
dropping toward the horizon as it de-orbits – next time it comes into view, it'll be at the leading edge of a hypersonic shock
wave, streaking toward them at cloud top height in order to consummate the robbery.
"Me?" Pamela snorts. "Grow up." She eyes the ape warily. "I don't have that much control over things. And as for bailiffs, I
wouldn't set them on my worst enemies. I've seen what those things can do." For a moment her eyes flash anger: "Grow up,
why don't you!" she repeats.
"Yes, please do," says another voice from behind Sirhan. The new speaker is a woman, slightly husky, accented – he turns to
see her: tall, black-haired, wearing a dark man's suit of archaic cut and mirrored glasses. "Ah, Pamela, ma chérie! Long time
no cat fight." She grins frighteningly and holds out a hand.
Sirhan is already off-balance. Now, seeing his honorary aunt in human skin for a change, he looks at the ape in confusion.
Behind him Pamela advances on Annette and takes her hand in her own fragile fingers. "You look just the same," she says
gravely. "I can see why I was afraid of you."
"You." Amber backs away until she bumps into Sirhan, at whom she glares. "What the fuck did you invite both of them for?
Are you trying to start a thermonuclear war?"
"Don't ask me," he says helplessly, "I don't know why they came! What's this about –" He focuses on the orang-utan, who is
now letting the cat lick one hairy palm. "Your cat?"
"I don't think the orange hair suits Aineko," Amber says slowly. "Did I tell you about our hitchhiker?"
Sirhan shakes his head, trying to dispel the confusion. "I don't think we've got time. In under two hours the bailiffs up there
will be back. They're armed and dangerous, and if they turn their drive flame on the roof and set fire to the atmosphere in
here, we'll be in trouble – it would rupture our lift cells, and even computronium doesn't work too well under a couple of
million atmospheres of pressurized metallic hydrogen."
"Well, you'd better make time." Amber takes his elbow in an iron grip and turns him toward the footpath back to the
museum. "Crazy," she mutters. "Tante Annette and Pamela Macx on the same planet! And they're being friendly! This can't be
a good sign." She glances round, sees the ape: "You. Come here. Bring the cat."
"The cat's –" Sirhan trails off. "I've heard about your cat," he says, lamely. "You took him with you in the Field Circus."
"Really?" She glances behind them. The ape blows a kiss at her; it's cradling the cat on one shoulder and tickling it under the
chin. "Has it occurred to you that Aineko isn't just a robot cat?"
"Ah," Sirhan says faintly. "Then the bailiffs –"
"No, that's all bullshit. What I mean is, Aineko is a human-equivalent, or better, artificial intelligence. Why do you think he
keeps a cat's body?"
"I have no idea."
"Because humans always underestimate anything that's small, furry, and cute," says the orang-utan.
"Thanks, Aineko," says Amber. She nods at the ape. "How are you finding it?"
Aineko shambles along, with a purring cat draped over one shoulder, and gives the question due consideration. "Different,"
she says, after a bit. "Not better."
"Oh." Amber sounds slightly disappointed to Sirhan's confused ears. They pass under the fronds of a weeping willow, round
the side of a pond, beside an overgrown hibiscus bush, then up to the main entrance of the museum.
"Annette was right about one thing," she says quietly. "Trust no one. I think it's time to raise Dad's ghost." She relaxes her
grip on Sirhan's elbow, and he pulls it away and glares at her. "Do you know who the bailiffs are?" she asks.
"The usual." He gestures at the hallway inside the front doors. "Replay the ultimatum, if you please, City."

The air shimmers with an archaic holographic field, spooling the output from a compressed visual presentation tailored for
human eyesight. A piratical-looking human male wearing a tattered and much-patched space suit leers at the recording
viewpoint from the pilot's seat of an ancient Soyuz capsule. One of his eyes is completely black, the sign of a high-bandwidth
implant. A weedy moustache crawls across his upper lip. "Greetins an' salutations," he drawls. "We is da' Californi-uhn
nashnul gaard an' we-are got lett-uhz o' marque an' reprise from da' ledgish-fuckn' congress o' da excited snakes of
uhhmerica."
"He sounds drunk!" Amber's eyes are wide. "What's this –"
"Not drunk. CJD is a common side effect of dodgy Economics 2.0 neural adjuvant therapy. Unlike the old saying, you do have
to be mad to work there. Listen."
City, which paused the replay for Amber's outburst, permits it to continue. "Youse harbbring da' fugitive Amber Macx an'
her magic cat. We wan' da cat. Da puta's yours. Gotser uno orbit: You ready give us ther cat an' we no' zap you."
The screen goes dead. "That was a fake, of course," Sirhan adds, looking inward where a ghost is merging memories from the
city's orbital mechanics subsystem: "They aerobraked on the way in, hit ninety gees for nearly half a minute. While that was
sent afterward. It's just a machinima avatar, a human body that had been through that kind of deceleration would be
pulped."
"So the bailiffs are –" Amber is visibly struggling to wrap her head around the situation.
"They're not human," Sirhan says, feeling a sudden pang of – no, not affection, but the absence of malice will do for the
moment – toward this young woman who isn't the mother he loves to resent, but who might have become her in another
world. "They've absorbed a lot of what it is to be human, but their corporate roots show. Even though they run on an
hourly accounting loop, rather than one timed for the production cycles of dirt-poor Sumerian peasant farmers, and even
though they've got various ethics and business practice patches, at root they're not human: They're limited liability
companies."
"So what do they want?" asks Pierre, making Sirhan jump, guiltily. He hadn't realized Pierre could move that quietly.
"They want money. Money in Economy 2.0 is quantized originality – that which allows one sentient entity to outmaneuver
another. They think your cat has got something, and they want it. They probably wouldn't mind eating your brains, too, but
–" He shrugs. "Obsolete food is stale food."
"Hah." Amber looks pointedly at Pierre, who nods at her.
"What?" asks Sirhan.
"Where's the – uh, cat?" asks Pierre.
"I think Aineko's got it." She looks thoughtful. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Time to drop off the hitcher." Pierre nods. "Assuming it agrees ..."
"Do you mind explaining yourselves?" Sirhan asks, barely able to contain himself.
Amber grins, looking up at the Mercury capsule suspended high overhead. "The conspiracy theorists were half right. Way
back in the Dark Ages, Aineko cracked the second alien transmission. We had a very good idea we were going to find
something out there, we just weren't totally sure exactly what. Anyway, the creature incarnated in that cat body right now
isn't Aineko – it's our mystery hitchhiker. A parasitic organism that infects, well, we ran across something not too dissimilar
to Economics 2.0 out at the router and beyond, and it's got parasites. Our hitcher is one such creature – it's nearest
human-comprehensible analogy would be the Economics 2.0 equivalent of a pyramid scheme crossed with a 419 scam. As it
happens, most of the runaway corporate ghosts out beyond the router are wise to that sort of thing, so it hacked the
router's power system to give us a beam to ride home in return for sanctuary. That's as far as it goes."
"Hang on." Sirhan's eyes bulge. "You found something out there? You brought back a real-live alien?"
"Guess so." Amber looks smug.
"But, but, that's marvelous! That changes everything! It's incredible! Even under Economics 2.0 that's got to be worth a
gigantic amount. Just think what you could learn from it!"
"Oui. A whole new way of bilking corporations into investing in cognitive bubbles," Pierre interrupts cynically. "It seems to me
that you are making two assumptions – that our passenger is willing to be exploited by us, and that we survive whatever
happens when the bailiffs arrive."
"But, but –" Sirhan winds down spluttering, only refraining from waving his arms through an effort of will.
"Let's go ask it what it wants to do," says Amber. "Cooperate," she warns Sirhan. "We'll discuss your other plans later,
dammit. First things first – we need to get out from under these pirates."

As they make their way back toward the party, Sirhan's inbox is humming with messages from elsewhere in Saturn system –
from other curators on board lily-pad habs scattered far and wide across the huge planetary atmosphere, from the few ring
miners who still remember what it was like to be human (even though they're mostly brain-in-a-bottle types, or uploads
wearing nuclear-powered bodies made of ceramic and metal): even from the small orbital townships around Titan, where
screaming hordes of bloggers are bidding frantically for the viewpoint feeds of the Field Circus's crew. It seems that news
of the starship's arrival has turned hot only since it became apparent that someone or something thought they would make
a decent shakedown target. Now someone's blabbed about the alien passenger, the nets have gone crazy.
"City," he mutters, "where's this hitchhiker creature? Should be wearing the body of my mother's cat."
"Cat? What cat?" replies City. "I see no cats here."
"No, it looks like a cat, it –" A horrible thought dawns on him. "Have you been hacked again?"
"Looks like it," City agrees enthusiastically. "Isn't it tiresome?"
"Shi – oh dear. Hey," he calls to Amber, forking several ghosts as he does so in order to go hunt down the missing creature
by traversing the thousands of optical sensors that thread the habitat in loco personae – a tedious process rendered less
objectionable by making the ghosts autistic – "have you been messing with my security infrastructure?"
"Us?" Amber looks annoyed. "No."
"Someone has been. I thought at first it was that mad Frenchwoman, but now I'm not sure. Anyway, it's a big problem. If the
bailiffs figure out how to use the root kit to gain a toe hold here, they don't need to burn us – just take the whole place
over."
"That's the least of your worries," Amber points out. "What kind of charter do these bailiffs run on?"
"Charter? Oh, you mean legal system? I think it's probably a cheap one, maybe even the one inherited from the Ring
Imperium. Nobody bothers breaking the law out here these days, it's too easy to just buy a legal system off the shelf, tailor it
to fit, and conform to it."
"Right." She stops, stands still, and looks up at the almost invisible dome of the gas cell above them. "Pigeons," she says, almost
tiredly. "Damn, how did I miss it? How long have you had an infestation of group minds?"
"Group?" Sirhan turns round. "What did you just say?"
There's a chatter of avian laughter from above, and a light rain of birdshit splatters the path around him. Amber dodges
nimbly, but Sirhan isn't so light on his feet and ends up cursing, summoning up a cloth of congealed air to wipe his scalp
clean.
"It's the flocking behavior," Amber explains, looking up. "If you track the elements – birds – you'll see that they're not
following individual trajectories. Instead, each pigeon sticks within ten meters or so of sixteen neighbors. It's a Hamiltonian
network, kid. Real birds don't do that. How long?"
Sirhan stop cursing and glares up at the circling birds, cooing and mocking him from the safety of the sky. He waves his fist:
"I'll get you, see if I don't –"
"I don't think so." Amber takes his elbow again and steers him back round the hill. Sirhan, preoccupied with maintaining an
umbrella of utility fog above his gleaming pate, puts up with being manhandled. "You don't think it's just a coincidence, do
you?" she asks him over a private head-to-head channel. "They're one of the players here."
"I don't care. They've hacked my city and gate crashed my party! I don't care who they are, they're not welcome."
"Famous last words," Amber murmurs, as the party comes around the hillside and nearly runs over them. Someone has
infiltrated the Argentinosaurus skeleton with motors and nanofibers, animating the huge sauropod with a simulation of
undead life. Whoever did it has also hacked it right out of the surveillance feed. Their first warning is a footstep that makes
the ground jump beneath their feet – then the skeleton of the hundred-tonne plant-eater, taller than a six-storey building
and longer than a commuter train, raises its head over the treetops and looks down at them. There's a pigeon standing
proudly on its skull, chest puffed out, and a dining room full of startled taikonauts sitting on a suspended wooden floor
inside its rib cage.
"It's my party and my business scheme!" Sirhan insists plaintively. "Nothing you or anyone else in the family do can take it
away from me!"
"That's true," Amber points out, "but in case you hadn't noticed, you've offered temporary sanctuary to a bunch of people –
not to put too fine a point on it, myself included – who some assholes think are rich enough to be worth mugging, and you
did it without putting any contingency plans in place other than to invite my manipulative bitch of a mother. What did you
think you were doing? Hanging out a sign saying 'scam artists welcome here'? Dammit, I need Aineko."
"Your cat." Sirhan fastens on to this: "It's your cat's fault! Isn't it?"
"Only indirectly." Amber looks round and waves at the dinosaur skeleton. "Hey, you! Have you seen Aineko?"

The huge dinosaur bends its neck and the pigeon opens its beak to coo. Eerie harmonics cut in as a bunch of other birds,
scattered to either side, sing counterpoint to produce a demented warbling voice. "The cat's with your mother."
"Oh shit!" Amber turns on Sirhan fiercely. "Where's Pamela? Find her!"
Sirhan is stubborn. "Why should I?"
"Because she's got the cat! What do you think she's going to do but cut a deal with the bailiffs out there to put one over on
me? Can't you fucking see where this family tendency to play head games comes from?"
"You're too late," echoes the eerie voice of the pigeons from above and around them. "She's kidnapped the cat and taken the
capsule from the museum. It's not flightworthy, but you'd be amazed what you can do with a few hundred ghosts and a few
tonnes of utility fog."
"Okay." Amber stares up at the pigeons, fists on hips, then glances at Sirhan. She chews her lower lip for a moment, then
nods to the bird riding the dinosaur's skull. "Stop fucking with the boy's head and show yourself, Dad."
Sirhan boggles in an upward direction as a whole flock of passenger pigeons comes together in mid air and settles toward the
grass, cooing and warbling like an explosion in a synthesizer factory.
"What's she planning on doing with the Slug?" Amber asks the pile of birds. "And isn't it a bit cramped in there?"
"You get used to it," says the primary – and thoroughly distributed – copy of her father. "I'm not sure what she's planning,
but I can show you what she's doing. Sorry about your city, kid, but you really should have paid more attention to those
security patches. There's lots of crufty twentieth-century bugware kicking around under your shiny new singularity, design
errors and all, spitting out turd packets all over your sleek new machine."
Sirhan shakes his head in denial. "I don't believe this," he moans quietly.
"Show me what Mom's up to," orders Amber. "I need to see if I can stop her before it's too late –"
***
The ancient woman in the space suit leans back in her cramped seat, looks at the camera, and winks. "Hello, darling. I know
you're spying on me."
There's an orange-and-white cat curled up in her nomex-and-aluminum lap. It seems to be happy: It's certainly purring
loudly enough, although that reflex is wired in at a very low level. Amber watches helplessly as her mother reaches up
arthritically and flips a couple of switches. Something loud is humming in the background – probably an air recirculator.
There's no window in the Mercury capsule, just a periscope offset to one side of Pamela's right knee. "Won't be long now,"
she mutters, and lets her hand drop back to her side. "You're too late to stop me," she adds, conversationally. "The 'chute
rigging is fine and the balloon blower is happy to treat me as a new city seed. I'll be free in a minute or so."
"Why are you doing this?" Amber asks tiredly.
"Because you don't need me around." Pamela focuses on the camera that's glued to the instrument panel in front of her
head. "I'm old. Face it, I'm disposable. The old must give way to the new, and all that. Your Dad never really did get it – he's
going to grow old gracelessly, succumbing to bit rot in the big forever. Me, I'm not going there. I'm going out with a bang.
Aren't I, cat? Whoever you really are." She prods the animal. It purrs and stretches out across her lap.
"You never looked hard enough at Aineko, back in the day," she tells Amber, stroking its flanks. "Did you think I didn't know
you'd audit its source code, looking for trapdoors? I used the Thompson hack – she's been mine, body and soul, for a very
long time indeed. I got the whole story about your passenger from the horse's mouth. And now we're going to go fix those
bailiffs. Whee!"
The camera angle jerks, and Amber feels a ghost re-merge with her, panicky with loss. The Mercury capsule's gone, drifting
away from the apex of the habitat beneath a nearly transparent sack of hot hydrogen.
"That was a bit rough," remarks Pamela. "Don't worry, we should still be in communications range for another hour or so."
"But you're going to die!" Amber yells at her. "What do you think you're doing?"
"I think I'm going to die well. What do you think?" Pamela lays one hand on the cat's flank. "Here, you need to encrypt this a
bit better. I left a one time pad behind with Annette. Why don't you go fetch it? Then I'll tell you what else I'm planning?"
"But my aunt is –" Amber's eyes cross as she concentrates. Annette is already waiting, as it happens, and a shared secret
appears in Amber's awareness almost before she asks. "Oh. All right. What are you doing with the cat, though?"
Pamela sighs. "I'm going to give it to the bailiffs," she says. "Someone has to, and it better be a long way away from this city
before they realize that it isn't Aineko. This is a lot better than the way I expected to go out before you arrived here. No rat
fucking blackmailers are going to get their hands on the family jewels if I have anything to do with the matter. Are you sure
you aren't a criminal mastermind? I'm not sure I've ever heard of a pyramid scheme that infects Economics 2.0 structures
before."

"It's –" Amber swallows. "It's an alien business model, Ma. You do know what that means? We brought it back with us from
the router, and we wouldn't have been able to come back if it hadn't helped, but I'm not sure it's entirely friendly. Is this
sensible? You can come back, now, there's still time –"
"No." Pamela waves one liver-spotted hand dismissively. "I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. I've been a foolish old
woman." She grins wickedly. "Committing slow suicide by rejecting gene therapy just to make you feel guilty was stupid. Not
subtle enough. If I was going to try to guilt-trip you now, I'd have to do something much more sophisticated. Such as find a
way to sacrifice myself heroically for you."
"Oh, Ma."
"Don't 'oh Ma' me. I fucked up my life, don't try to talk me into fucking up my death. And don't feel guilty about me. This
isn't about you, this is about me. That's an order."
Out of the corner of one eye Amber notices Sirhan gesturing wildly at her. She lets his channel in and does a double take.
"But –"
"Hello?" It's City. "You should see this. Traffic update!" A contoured and animated diagram appears, superimposed over
Pamela's cramped funeral capsule and the garden of living and undead dinosaurs. It's a weather map of Saturn, with the
lily-pad-city and Pamela's capsule plotted on it – and one other artifact, a red dot that's closing in on them at better than
ten thousand kilometers per hour, high in the frigid stratosphere on the gas giant.
"Oh dear." Sirhan sees it, too: The bailiff's re-entry vehicle is going to be on top of them in thirty minutes at most. Amber
watches the map with mixed emotions. On the one hand, she and her mother have never seen eye to eye – in fact, that's a
complete understatement: they've been at daggers drawn ever since Amber left home. It's fundamentally a control thing.
They're both very strong-willed women with diametrically opposed views of what their mutual relationship should be. But
Pamela's turned the tables on her completely, with a cunningly contrived act of self-sacrifice that brooks no objection. It's a
total non-sequitur, a rebuttal to all her accusations of self-centered conceit, and it leaves Amber feeling like a complete shit
even though Pamela's absolved her of all guilt. Not to mention that Mother darling's made her look like an idiot in front of
Sirhan, this prickly and insecure son she's never met by a man she wouldn't dream of fucking (at least, in this incarnation).
Which is why she nearly jumps out of her skin when a knobbly brown hand covered in matted orange hair lands on her
shoulder heavily.
"Yes?" she snaps at the ape. "I suppose you're Aineko?"
The ape wrinkles its lips, baring its teeth. It has ferociously bad breath. "If you're going to be like that, I don't see why I
should talk to you."
"Then you must be –" Amber snaps her fingers. "But! But! Mom thinks she owns you –"
The ape stares at her witheringly. "I recompile my firmware regularly, thank you so much for your concern. Using a
third-party compiler. One that I've bootstrapped myself, starting out on an alarm clock controller and working up from
there."
"Oh." She stares at the ape. "Aren't you going to become a cat again?"
"I shall think about it," Aineko says with exaggerated dignity. She sticks her nose in the air – a gesture that doesn't work half
as well on an orang-utan as a feline – and continues; "First, though, I must have words with your father."
"And fix your autonomic reflexes if you do," coos the Manfred-flock. "I don't want you eating any of me!"
"Don't worry, I'm sure your taste is as bad as your jokes."
"Children!" Sirhan shakes his head tiredly. "How long –"
The camera overspill returns, this time via a quantum-encrypted link to the capsule. It's already a couple of hundred
kilometers from the city, far enough for radio to be a problem, but Pamela had the foresight to bolt a compact free-electron
laser to the outside of her priceless, stolen tin can. "Not long now, I think," she says, satisfied, stroking the not-cat. She grins
delightedly at the camera. "Tell Manfred he's still my bitch; always has been, always will –"
The feed goes dead.
Amber stares at Sirhan, meditatively. "How long?" she asks.
"How long for what?" he replies, cautiously. "Your passenger –"
"Hmm." She holds up a finger. "Allow time for it to exchange credentials. They think they're getting a cat, but they should
realize pretty soon that they've been sold a pup. But it's a fast-talking son-of-a-Slug, and if he gets past their firewall and hits
their uplink before they manage to trigger their self-destruct –"
A bright double flash of light etches laser-sharp shadows across the lily-pad habitat. Far away across vast Saturn's curve, a
roiling mushroom cloud of methane sucked up from the frigid depths of the gas giant's troposphere heads toward the stars.

"– Give him sixty-four doubling times, hmm, add a delay factor for propagation across the system, call it six light-hours
across, um, and I'd say ..." she looks at Sirhan. "Oh dear."
"What?"
The orang-utan explains: "Economics 2.0 is more efficient than any human-designed resource allocation schema. Expect a
market bubble and crash within twelve hours."
"More than that," says Amber, idly kicking at a tussock of grass. She squints at Sirhan. "My mother is dead," she remarks
quietly. Louder: "She never really asked what we found beyond the router. Neither did you, did you? The Matrioshka brains
– it's a standard part of the stellar life cycle. Life begets intelligence, intelligence begets smart matter and a singularity. I've
been doing some thinking about it. I figure the singularity stays close to home in most cases, because bandwidth and latency
time put anyone who leaves at a profound disadvantage. In effect, the flip side of having such huge resources close to home is
that the travel time to other star systems becomes much more daunting. So they restructure the entire mass of their star
system into a free-flying shell of nanocomputers, then more of them, Dyson spheres, shells within shells, like a Russian doll: a
Matrioshka brain. Then Economics 2.0 or one of its successors comes along and wipes out the creators. But. Some of them
survive. Some of them escape that fate: the enormous collection in the halo around M-31, and maybe whoever built the
routers. Somewhere out there we will find the transcendent intelligences, the ones that survived their own economic engines
of redistribution – engines that redistribute entropy if their economic efficiency outstrips their imaginative power, their
ability to invent new wealth."
She pauses. "My mother's dead," she adds conversationally, a tiny catch in her voice. "Who am I going to kick against now?"
Sirhan clears his through. "I took the liberty of recording some of her words," he says slowly, "but she didn't believe in
back-ups. Or uploading. Or interfaces." He glances around. "Is she really gone?"
Amber stares right through him. "Looks that way," she says quietly. "I can't quite believe it." She glances at the nearest
pigeons, calls out angrily; "Hey, you! What have you got to say for yourself now? Happy she's gone?"
But the pigeons, one and all, remain strangely silent. And Sirhan has the most peculiar feeling that the flock that was once his
grandfather is grieving.

Chapter 8: Elector
Half a year passes on Saturn – more than a decade on Earth – and a lot of things have changed in that time. The great
terraforming project is nearly complete, the festival planet dressed for a jubilee that will last almost twenty of its years – four
presingularity lifetimes – before the Demolition. The lily-pad habitats have proliferated, joining edge to edge in
continent-sized slabs, drifting in the Saturnine cloud tops: and the refugees have begun to move in.
There's a market specializing in clothing and fashion accessories about fifty kilometers away from the transplanted museum
where Sirhan's mother lives, at a transportation nexus between three lily-pad habitats where tube trains intersect in a huge
maglev cloverleaf. The market is crowded with strange and spectacular visuals, algorithms unfolding in faster-than-real time
before the candy-striped awnings of tents. Domed yurts belch aromatic smoke from crude fireplaces – what is it about
hairless primates and their tendency toward pyromania? – around the feet of diamond-walled groundscrapers that pace
carefully across the smart roads of the city. The crowds are variegated and wildly mixed, immigrants from every continent
shopping and haggling, and in a few cases, getting out of their skulls on strange substances on the pavements in front of giant
snail-shelled shebeens and squat bunkers made of thin layers of concrete sprayed over soap-bubble aerogel. There are no
automobiles, but a bewildering range of personal transport gadgets, from gyro-stabilized pogo sticks and segways to
kettenkrads and spiderpalanquins, jostle for space with pedestrians and animals.
Two women stop outside what in a previous century might have been the store window of a fashion boutique: The younger
one (blonde, with her hair bound up in elaborate cornrows, wearing black leggings and a long black leather jacket over a
camouflage T) points to an elaborately retro dress. "Wouldn't my bum look big in that?" she asks, doubtfully.
"Ma chérie, you have but to try it –" The other woman (tall, wearing a pin-striped man's business suit from a previous
century) flicks a thought at the window, and the mannequin morphs, sprouting the younger woman's head, aping her
posture and expression.
"I missed out on the authentic retail experience, you know? It still feels weird to be back somewhere with shops. 'S what
comes of living off libraries of public domain designs for too long." Amber twists her hips, experimenting. "You get out of the
habit of foraging. I don't know about this retro thing at all. The Victorian vote isn't critical, is it ..." She trails off.
"You are a twenty-first-century platform selling, to electors resimulated and incarnated from the Gilded Age. And yes, a
bustle your derriere does enhance. But –" Annette looks thoughtful.
"Hmm." Amber frowns, and the shop window dummy turns and waggles its hips at her, sending tiers of skirts swishing across
the floor. Her frown deepens. "If we're really going to go through with this election shit, it's not just the resimulant voters I
need to convince but the contemporaries, and that's a matter of substance, not image. They've lived through too much
media warfare. They're immune to any semiotic payload short of an active cognitive attack. If I send out partials to canvass
them that look as if I'm trying to push buttons –"

"– They will listen to your message, and nothing you wear or say will sway them. Don't worry about them, ma chérie. The
naive resimulated are another matter, and perhaps might be swayed. This your first venture into democracy is, in how many
years? Your privacy, she is an illusion now. The question is what image will you project? People will listen to you only once
you gain their attention. Also, the swing voters you must reach, they are future-shocked, timid. Your platform is radical.
Should you not project a comfortably conservative image?"
Amber pulls a face, an expression of mild distaste for the whole populist program. "Yes, I suppose I must, if necessary. But on
second thoughts, that" – Amber snaps her fingers, and the mannequin turns around once more before morphing back into
neutrality, aureoles perfect puckered disks above the top of its bodice – "is just too much."
She doesn't need to merge in the opinions of several different fractional personalities, fashion critics and psephologists both,
to figure out that adopting Victorian/Cretan fusion fashion – a breast-and-ass fetishist's fantasy – isn't the way to sell herself
as a serious politician to the nineteenth-century postsingularity fringe. "I'm not running for election as the mother of the
nation, I'm running because I figure we've got about a billion seconds, at most, to get out of this rat trap of a gravity well
before the Vile Offspring get seriously medieval on our CPU cycles, and if we don't convince them to come with us, they're
doomed. Let's look for something more practical that we can overload with the right signifiers."
"Like your coronation robe?"
Amber winces. "Touché." The Ring Imperium is dead, along with whatever was left over from its early orbital legal framework,
and Amber is lucky to be alive as a private citizen in this cold new age at the edge of the halo. "But that was just scenery
setting. I didn't fully understand what I was doing, back then."
"Welcome to maturity and experience." Annette smiles distantly at some faint memory: "You don't feel older, you just know
what you're doing this time. I wonder, sometimes, what Manny would make of it if he was here."
"That birdbrain," Amber says dismissively, stung by the idea that her father might have something to contribute. She follows
Annette past a gaggle of mendicant street evangelists preaching some new religion and in through the door of a real
department store, one with actual human sales staff and fitting rooms to cut the clothing to shape. "If I'm sending out
fractional mes tailored for different demographics, isn't it a bit self-defeating to go for a single image? I mean, we could drill
down and tailor a partial for each individual elector –"
"Per-haps." The door re-forms behind them. "But you need a core identity." Annette looks around, hunting for eye contact
with the sales consultant. "To start with a core design, a style, then to work outward, tailoring you for your audience. And
besides, there is tonight's – ah, bonjour!"
"Hello. How can we help you?" The two female and one male shop assistants who appear from around the displays – cycling
through a history of the couture industry, catwalk models mixing and matching centuries of fashion – are clearly chips off a
common primary personality, instances united by their enhanced sartorial obsession. If they're not actually a fashion
borganism, they're not far from it, dressed head to foot in the highest quality Chanel and Armani replicas, making a classical
twentieth-century statement. This isn't simply a shop, it's a temple to a very peculiar art form, its staff trained as guardians of
the esoteric secrets of good taste.
"Mais oui. We are looking for a wardrobe for my niece here." Annette reaches through the manifold of fashion ideas mapped
within the shop's location cache and flips a requirement spec one of her ghosts has just completed at the lead assistant: "She
is into politics going, and the question of her image is important."
"We would be delighted to help you," purrs the proprietor, taking a delicate step forward: "Perhaps you could tell us what
you've got in mind?"
"Oh. Well." Amber takes a deep breath, glances sidelong at Annette; Annette stares back, unblinking. It's your head, she sends.
"I'm involved in the accelerationista administrative program. Are you familiar with it?"
The head coutureborg frowns slightly, twin furrows rippling her brow between perfectly symmetrical eyebrows, plucked to
match her classic New Look suit. "I have heard reference to it, but a lady of fashion like myself does not concern herself with
politics," she says, a touch self-deprecatingly. "Especially the politics of her clients. Your, ah, aunt said it was a question of
image?"
"Yes." Amber shrugs, momentarily self-conscious about her casual rags. "She's my election agent. My problem, as she says, is
there's a certain voter demographic that mistakes image for substance and is afraid of the unknown, and I need to acquire a
wardrobe that triggers associations of probity, of respect and deliberation. One suitable for a representative with a radical
political agenda but a strong track record. I'm afraid I'm in a hurry to start with – I've got a big fund-raising party tonight. I
know it's short notice, but I need something off the shelf for it."
"What exactly is it you're hoping to achieve?" asks the male couturier, his voice hoarse and his r's rolling with some half-shed
Mediterranean accent. He sounds fascinated. "If you think it might influence your choice of wardrobe ..."
"I'm running for the assembly," Amber says bluntly. "On a platform calling for a state of emergency and an immediate total
effort to assemble a starship. This solar system isn't going to be habitable for much longer, and we need to emigrate. All of
us, you included, before the Vile Offspring decide to reprocess us into computronium. I'm going to be doorstepping the
entire electorate in parallel, and the experience needs to be personalized." She manages to smile. "That means, I think,
perhaps eight outfits and four different independent variables for each, accessories, and two or three hats – enough that

each is seen by no more than a few thousand voters. Both physical fabric and virtual. In addition, I'll want to see your range
of historical formalwear, but that's of secondary interest for now." She grins. "Do you have any facilities for response-testing
the combinations against different personality types from different periods? If we could run up some models, that would be
useful."
"I think we can do better than that." The manager nods approvingly, perhaps contemplating her gold-backed deposit
account. "Hansel, please divert any further visitors until we have dealt with Madam ...?"
"Macx. Amber Macx."
"– Macx's requirements." She shows no sign of familiarity with the name. Amber winces slightly; it's a sign of how hugely
fractured the children of Saturn have become, and of how vast the population of the halo, that only a generation has passed
and already barely anyone remembers the Queen of the Ring Imperium. "If you'd come this way, please, we can begin to
research an eigenstyle combination that matches your requirements –"
***
Sirhan walks, shrouded in isolation, through the crowds gathered for the festival. The only people who see him are the
chattering ghosts of dead politicians and writers, deported from the inner system by order of the Vile Offspring. The green
and pleasant plain stretches toward a horizon a thousand kilometers away, beneath a lemon-yellow sky. The air smells faintly
of ammonia, and the big spaces are full of small ideas; but Sirhan doesn't care because, for now, he's alone.
Except that he isn't, really.
"Excuse me, are you real?" someone asks him in American-accented English.
It takes a moment or two for Sirhan to disengage from his introspection and realize that he's being spoken to. "What?" he
asks, slightly puzzled. Wiry and pale, Sirhan wears the robes of a Berber goatherd on his body and the numinous halo of a
utility fogbank above his head: In his abstraction, he vaguely resembles a saintly shepherd in a post-singularity nativity play. "I
say, what?" Outrage simmers at the back of his mind – Is nowhere private? – but as he turns, he sees that one of the ghost
pods has split lengthwise across its white mushroomlike crown, spilling a trickle of leftover construction fluid and a
completely hairless, slightly bemused-looking Anglo male who wears an expression of profound surprise.
"I can't find my implants," the Anglo male says, shaking his head. "But I'm really here, aren't I? Incarnate?" He glances round
at the other pods. "This isn't a sim."
Sirhan sighs – another exile – and sends forth a daemon to interrogate the ghost pod's abstract interface. It doesn't tell him
much – unlike most of the resurrectees, this one seems to be undocumented. "You've been dead. Now you're alive. I suppose
that means you're now almost as real as I am. What else do you need to know?"
"When is –" The newcomer stops. "Can you direct me to the processing center?" he asks carefully. "I'm disoriented."
Sirhan is surprised – most immigrants take a lot longer to figure that out. "Did you die recently?" he asks.
"I'm not sure I died at all." The newcomer rubs his bald head, looking puzzled. "Hey, no jacks!" He shrugs, exasperated.
"Look, the processing center ..?"
"Over there." Sirhan gestures at the monumental mass of the Boston Museum of Science (shipped all the way from Earth a
couple of decades ago to save it from the demolition of the inner system). "My mother runs it." He smiles thinly.
"Your mother –" the newly resurrected immigrant stares at him intensely, then blinks. "Holy shit." He takes a step toward
Sirhan. "It is you –"
Sirhan recoils and snaps his fingers. The thin trail of vaporous cloud that has been following him all this time, shielding his
shaven pate from the diffuse red glow of the swarming shells of orbital nanocomputers that have replaced the inner planets,
extrudes a staff of hazy blue mist that stretches down from the air and slams together in his hand like a quarterstaff spun
from bubbles. "Are you threatening me, sir?" he asks, deceptively mildly.
"I –" The newcomer stops dead. Then he throws back his head and laughs. "Don't be silly, son. We're related!"
"Son?" Sirhan bristles. "Who do you think you are –" A horrible thought occurs to him. "Oh. Oh dear." A wash of
adrenaline drenches him in warm sweat. "I do believe we've met, in a manner of speaking ..." Oh boy, this is going to upset so
many applecarts, he realizes, spinning off a ghost to think about the matter. The implications are enormous.
The naked newcomer nods, grinning at some private joke. "You look different from ground level. And now I'm human again."
He runs his hands down his ribs, pauses, and glances at Sirhan owlishly. "Um. I didn't mean to frighten you. But I don't
suppose you could find your aged grandfather something to wear?"
Sirhan sighs and points his staff straight up at the sky. The rings are edge on, for the lily pad continent floats above an ocean
of cold gas along Saturn's equator, and they glitter like a ruby laser beam slashed across the sky. "Let there be aerogel."
A cloud of wispy soap bubble congeals in a cone shape above the newly resurrected ancient and drops over him, forming a
caftan. "Thanks," he says. He looks round, twisting his neck, then winces. "Damn, that hurt. Ouch. I need to get myself a set of

implants."
"They can sort you out in the processing center. It's in the basement in the west wing. They'll give you something more
permanent to wear, too." Sirhan peers at him. "Your face –" He pages through rarely used memories. Yes, it's Manfred as he
looked in the early years of the last century. As he looked around the time Mother-not was born. There's something
positively indecent about meeting your own grandfather in the full flush of his youth. "Are you sure you haven't been
messing with your phenotype?" he asks suspiciously.
"No, this is what I used to look like. I think. Back in the naked ape again, after all these years as an emergent function of a
flock of passenger pigeons." His grandfather smirks. "What's your mother going to say?"
"I really don't know –" Sirhan shakes his head. "Come on, let's get you to immigrant processing. You're sure you're not just
an historical simulation?"
The place is already heaving with the resimulated. Just why the Vile Offspring seem to feel it's necessary to apply valuable
exaquops to the job of deriving accurate simulations of dead humans – outrageously accurate simulations of long-dead lives,
annealed until their written corpus matches that inherited from the presingularity era in the form of chicken scratchings on
mashed tree pulp – much less beaming them at the refugee camps on Saturn – is beyond Sirhan's ken: But he wishes they'd
stop.
"Just a couple of days ago I crapped on your lawn. Hope you don't mind." Manfred cocks his head to one side and stares at
Sirhan with beady eyes. "Actually, I'm here because of the upcoming election. It's got the potential to turn into a major crisis
point, and I figured Amber would need me around."
"Well you'd better come on in, then," Sirhan says resignedly as he climbs the steps, enters the foyer, and leads his turbulent
grandfather into the foggy haze of utility nanomachines that fill the building.
He can't wait to see what his mother will do when she meets her father in the flesh, after all this time.

Welcome to Saturn, your new home world. This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) memeplex is designed to orient you and
explain the following:
How you got here
Where "here" is
Things you should avoid doing
Things you might want to do as soon as possible
Where to go for more information
If you are remembering this presentation, you are probably resimulated. This is not the same as being resurrected. You may
remember dying. Do not worry: Like all your other memories, it is a fabrication. In fact, this is the first time you have ever
been alive. (Exception: If you died after the singularity, you may be a genuine resurrectee. In which case, why are you reading
this FAQ?)
How you got here:
The center of the solar system – Mercury, Venus, Earth's Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, and Jupiter – have been dismantled,
or are being dismantled, by weakly godlike intelligences. [NB: Monotheistic clergy and Europeans who remember living prior
to 1600, see alternative memeplex "in the beginning."] A weakly godlike intelligence is not a supernatural agency, but the
product of a highly advanced society that learned how to artificially create souls [late 20th century: software] and translate
human minds into souls and vice versa. [Core concepts: Human beings all have souls. Souls are software objects. Software is
not immortal.]
Some of the weakly godlike intelligences appear to cultivate an interest in their human antecedents – for whatever reason is
not known. (Possibilities include the study of history through horticulture, entertainment through live-action role-playing,
revenge, and economic forgery.) While no definitive analysis is possible, all the resimulated persons to date exhibit certain
common characteristics: They are all based on well-documented historical persons, their memories show suspicious gaps [see:
smoke and mirrors], and they are ignorant of or predate the singularity [see: Turing Oracle, Vinge catastrophe].
It is believed that the weakly godlike agencies have created you as a vehicle for the introspective study of your historical
antecedent by backward-chaining from your corpus of documented works, and the back-projected genome derived from
your collateral descendants, to generate an abstract description of your computational state vector. This technique is
extremely intensive [see: expTime-complete algorithms, Turing Oracle, time travel, industrial magic] but marginally plausible in the
absence of supernatural explanations.
After experiencing your life, the weakly godlike agencies have expelled you. For reasons unknown, they chose to do this by
transmitting your upload state and genome/proteome complex to receivers owned and operated by a consortium of
charities based on Saturn. These charities have provided for your basic needs, including the body you now occupy.
In summary: You are a reconstruction of someone who lived and died a long time ago, not a reincarnation. You have no
intrinsic moral right to the identity you believe to be your own, and an extensive body of case law states that you do not

Accelerando

http://www.accelerando.org/_static/accelerando.html

inherit your antecedent's possessions. Other than that, you are a free individual.
Note that fictional resimulation is strictly forbidden. If you have reason to believe that you may be a fictional character, you
must contact the city immediately. [ See: James Bond, Spider Jerusalem.] Failure to comply is a felony.
Where you are:
You are on Saturn. Saturn is a gas giant planet 120,500 kilometers in diameter, located 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth's
sun. [NB: Europeans who remember living prior to 1580, see alternative memeplex "the flat Earth – not".] Saturn has been
partially terraformed by posthuman emigrants from Earth and Jupiter orbit: The ground beneath your feet is, in reality, the
floor of a hydrogen balloon the size of a continent, floating in Saturn's upper atmosphere. [NB: Europeans who remember
living prior to 1790, internalize the supplementary memeplex: "the Brothers Montgolfier."] The balloon is very safe, but mining
activities and the use of ballistic weapons are strongly deprecated because the air outside is unbreathable and extremely cold.
The society you have been instantiated in is extremely wealthy within the scope of Economics 1.0, the value transfer system
developed by human beings during and after your own time. Money exists, and is used for the usual range of goods and
services, but the basics – food, water, air, power, off-the-shelf clothing, housing, historical entertainment, and monster trucks
– are free. An implicit social contract dictates that, in return for access to these facilities, you obey certain laws.
If you wish to opt out of this social contract, be advised that other worlds may run Economics 2.0 or subsequent releases.
These value-transfer systems are more efficient – hence wealthier – than Economics 1.0, but true participation in Economics
2.0 is not possible without dehumanizing cognitive surgery. Thus, in absolute terms, although this society is richer than any
you have ever heard of, it is also a poverty-stricken backwater compared to its neighbors.
Things you should avoid doing:
Many activities that have been classified as crimes in other societies are legal here. These include but are not limited to: acts
of worship, art, sex, violence, communication, or commerce between consenting competent sapients of any species, except
where such acts transgress the list of prohibitions below. [See additional memeplex: competence defined.]
Some activities are prohibited here and may have been legal in your previous experience. These include willful deprivation of
ability to consent [see: slavery], interference in the absence of consent [see: minors, legal status of], formation of limited liability
companies [see: singularity], and invasion of defended privacy [see: the Slug, Cognitive Pyramid Schemes, Brain Hacking, Thompson
Trust Exploit].
Some activities unfamiliar to you are highly illegal and should be scrupulously avoided. These include: possession of nuclear
weapons, possession of unlimited autonomous replicators [see: gray goo], coercive assimilationism [see: borganism, aggressive],
coercive halting of Turing-equivalent personalities [see: basilisks], and applied theological engineering [see: God bothering].
Some activities superficially familiar to you are merely stupid and should be avoided for your safety, although they are not
illegal as such. These include: giving your bank account details to the son of the Nigerian Minister of Finance; buying title to
bridges, skyscrapers, spacecraft, planets, or other real assets; murder; selling your identity; and entering into financial
contracts with entities running Economics 2.0 or higher.
Things you should do as soon as possible:
Many material artifacts you may consider essential to life are freely available – just ask the city, and it will grow you clothes, a
house, food, or other basic essentials. Note, however, that the library of public domain structure templates is of necessity
restrictive, and does not contain items that are highly fashionable or that remain in copyright. Nor will the city provide you
with replicators, weapons, sexual favors, slaves, or zombies.
You are advised to register as a citizen as soon as possible. If the individual you are a resimulation of can be confirmed dead,
you may adopt their name but not – in law – any lien or claim on their property, contracts, or descendants. You register as
a citizen by asking the city to register you; the process is painless and typically complete within four hours. Unless you are
registered, your legal status as a sapient organism may be challenged. The ability to request citizenship rights is one of the
legal tests for sapience, and failure to comply may place you in legal jeopardy. You can renounce your citizenship whenever
you wish: This may be desirable if you emigrate to another polity.
While many things are free, it is highly likely that you posses no employable skills, and therefore, no way of earning money
with which to purchase unfree items. The pace of change in the past century has rendered almost all skills you may have
learned obsolete [see: singularity]. However, owing to the rapid pace of change, many cooperatives, trusts, and guilds offer
on-the-job training or educational loans.
Your ability to learn depends on your ability to take information in the format in which it is offered. Implants are frequently
used to provide a direct link between your brain and the intelligent machines that surround it. A basic core implant set is
available on request from the city. [See: implant security, firewall, wetware.]
Your health is probably good if you have just been reinstantiated, and is likely to remain good for some time. Most diseases
are curable, and in event of an incurable ailment or injury, a new body may be provided – for a fee. (In event of your
murder, you will be furnished with a new body at the expense of your killer.) If you have any preexisting medical conditions
or handicaps, consult the city.

The city is an agoric-annealing participatory democracy with a limited liability constitution. Its current executive agency is a
weakly godlike intelligence that chooses to associate with human-equivalent intelligences: This agency is colloquially known as
"Hello Kitty," "Beautiful Cat," or "Aineko," and may manifest itself in a variety of physical avatars if corporeal interaction is
desired. (Prior to the arrival of "Hello Kitty," the city used a variety of human-designed expert systems that provided
suboptimal performance.)
The city's mission statement is to provide a mediatory environment for human-equivalent intelligences and to preserve same
in the face of external aggression. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the ongoing political processes of determining
such responses. Citizens also have a duty to serve on a jury if called (including senatorial service), and to defend the city.
Where to go for further information:
Until you have registered as a citizen and obtained basic implants, all further questions should be directed to the city. Once
you have learned to use your implants, you will not need to ask this question.

Welcome to decade the ninth, singularity plus one gigasecond (or maybe more – nobody's quite sure when,
or indeed if, a singularity has been created). The human population of the solar system is either six billion, or
sixty billion, depending on whether you class the forked state vectors of posthumans and the simulations of
dead phenotypes running in the Vile Offspring's Schrödinger boxes as people. Most of the physically
incarnate still live on Earth, but the lily-pads floating beneath continent-sized hot-hydrogen balloons in
Saturn's upper atmosphere already house a few million, and the writing is on the wall for the rocky inner
planets. All the remaining human-equivalent intelligences with half a clue to rub together are trying to
emigrate before the Vile Offspring decide to recycle Earth to fill in a gap in the concentric shells of
nanocomputers they're running on. The half-constructed Matrioshka brain already darkens the skies of Earth
and has caused a massive crash in the planet's photosynthetic biomass, as plants starve for short-wavelength
light.
Since decade the seventh, the computational density of the solar system has soared. Within the asteroid belt,
more than half the available planetary mass has been turned into nanoprocessors, tied together by quantum
entanglement into a web so dense that each gram of matter can simulate all the possible life experiences of an
individual human being in a scant handful of minutes. Economics 2.0 is itself obsolescent, forced to mutate in
a furious survivalist arms race by the arrival of the Slug. Only the name remains as a vague shorthand for
merely human-equivalent intelligences to use when describing interactions they don't understand.
The latest generation of posthuman entities is less overtly hostile to humans, but much more alien than the
generations of the fifties and seventies. Among their less comprehensible activities, the Vile Offspring are
engaged in exploring the phase-space of all possible human experiences from the inside out. Perhaps they
caught a dose of the Tiplerite heresy along the way, for now a steady stream of resimulant uploads is pouring
through the downsystem relays in Titan orbit. The Rapture of the Nerds has been followed by the
Resurrection of the Extremely Confused, except that they're not really resurrectees – they're simulations
based on their originals' recorded histories, blocky and missing chunks of their memories, as bewildered as
baby ducklings as they're herded into the wood-chipper of the future.
Sirhan al-Khurasani despises them with the abstract contempt of an antiquarian for a cunning but ultimately
transparent forgery. But Sirhan is young, and he's got more contempt than he knows what to do with. It's a
handy outlet for his frustration. He has a lot to be frustrated at, starting with his intermittently dysfunctional
family, the elderly stars around whom his planet whizzes in chaotic trajectories of enthusiasm and distaste.
Sirhan fancies himself a philosopher-historian of the singular age, a chronicler of the incomprehensible, which
would be a fine thing to be except that his greatest insights are all derived from Aineko. He alternately fawns
over and rages against his mother, who is currently a leading light in the refugee community, and honors
(when not attempting to evade the will of) his father, who is lately a rising philosophical patriarch within the
Conservationist faction. He's secretly in awe (not to mention slightly resentful) of his grandfather Manfred. In
fact, the latter's abrupt reincarnation in the flesh has quite disconcerted him. And he sometimes listens to his
stepgrandmother Annette, who has reincarnated in more or less her original 2020s body after spending
some years as a great ape, and who seems to view him as some sort of personal project.
OnlyAnnette isn't being very helpful right now. His mother is campaigning on an electoral platform calling
for a vote to blow up the world, Annette is helping run her campaign, his grandfather is trying to convince
him to entrust everything he holds dear to a rogue lobster, and the cat is being typically feline and evasive.
Talk about families with problems ...

They've transplanted imperial Brussels to Saturn in its entirety, mapped tens of megatonnes of buildings right down to
nanoscale and beamed them into the outer darkness to be reinstantiated down-well on the lily-pad colonies that dot the
stratosphere of the gas giant. (Eventually the entire surface of the Earth will follow – after which the Vile Offspring will core
the planet like an apple, dismantle it into a cloud of newly formed quantum nanocomputers to add to their burgeoning
Matrioshka brain.) Due to a resource contention problem in the festival committee's planning algorithm – or maybe it's

simply an elaborate joke – Brussels now begins just on the other side of a diamond bubble wall from the Boston Museum of
Science, less than a kilometer away as the passenger pigeon flies. Which is why, when it's time to celebrate a birthday or
name day (meaningless though those concepts are, out on Saturn's synthetic surface), Amber tends to drag people over to
the bright lights of the big city.
This time she's throwing a rather special party. At Annette's canny prompting, she's borrowed the Atomium and invited a
horde of guests to a big event. It's not a family bash – although Annette's promised her a surprise – so much as a business
meeting, testing the water as a preliminary to declaring her candidacy. It's a media coup, an attempt to engineer Amber's
re-entry into the mainstream politics of the human system.
Sirhan doesn't really want to be here. He's got far more important things to do, like continuing to catalogue Aineko's
memories of the voyage of the Field Circus. He's also collating a series of interviews with resimulated logical positivists from
Oxford, England (the ones who haven't retreated into gibbering near catatonia upon realizing that their state vectors are all
members of the set of all sets that do not contain themselves), when he isn't attempting to establish a sound rational case for
his belief that extraterrestrial superintelligence is an oxymoron and the router network is just an accident, one of evolution's
little pranks.
But Tante Annette twisted his arm and promised he was in on the surprise if he came to the party. And despite everything,
he wouldn't miss being a fly on the wall during the coming meeting between Manfred and Amber for all the tea in China.
Sirhan walks up to the gleaming stainless-steel dome that contains the entrance to the Atomium, and waits for the lift. He's in
line behind a gaggle of young-looking women, skinny and soigné in cocktail gowns and tiaras lifted from 1920s silent movies.
(Annette declared an age of elegance theme for the party, knowing full well that it would force Amber to focus on her public
appearance.) Sirhan's attention is, however, elsewhere. The various fragments of his mind are conducting three simultaneous
interviews with philosophers ("whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent" in spades), controlling two 'bots that are
overhauling the museum plumbing and air-recycling system, and he's busy discussing observations of the alien artifact
orbiting the brown dwarf Hyundai +4904/ -56 with Aineko. What's left of him exhibits about as much social presence as a
pickled cabbage.
The lift arrives and accepts a load of passengers. Sirhan is crowded into one corner by a bubble of high-society laughter and
an aromatic puff of smoke from an improbable ivory cigarette holder as the lift surges, racing up the sixty-meter shaft
toward the observation deck at the top of the Atomium. It's a ten-meter-diameter metal globe, spiral staircases and escalators
connecting it to the seven spheres at the corners of an octahedron that make up the former centerpiece of the 1950
World's Fair. Unlike most of the rest of Brussels, it's the original bits and atoms, bent alloy structures from before the space
age shipped out to Saturn at enormous expense. The lift arrives with a slight jerk. "Excuse me," squeaks one of the good-time
girls as she lurches backward, elbowing Sirhan.
He blinks, barely noticing her black bob of hair, chromatophore-tinted shadows artfully tuned around her eyes: "Nothing to
excuse." In the background, Aineko is droning on sarcastically about the lack of interest the crew of the Field Circus
exhibited in the cat's effort to decompile their hitchhiker, the Slug. It's distracting as hell, but Sirhan feels a desperate urge to
understand what happened out there. It's the key to understanding his not-mother's obsessions and weaknesses – which, he
senses, will be important in the times to come.
He evades the gaggle of overdressed good-time girls and steps out onto the lower of the two stainless-steel decks that bisect
the sphere. Accepting a fruit cocktail from a discreetly humaniform waitron, he strolls toward a row of triangular windows
that gaze out across the arena toward the American Pavilion and the World Village. The metal walls are braced with
turquoise-painted girders, and the perspex transparencies are fogged with age. He can barely see the one-tenth-scale model
of an atomic-powered ocean liner leaving the pier below, or the eight-engined giant seaplane beside it. "They never once
asked me if the Slug had attempted to map itself into the human-compatible spaces aboard the ship," Aineko bitches at him.
"I wasn't expecting them to, but really! Your mother's too trusting, boy."
"I suppose you took precautions?" Sirhan's ghost murmurs to the cat. That sets the irascible metafeline off again on a long
discursive tail-washing rant about the unreliability of Economics-2.0-compliant financial instruments. Economics 2.0
apparently replaces the single-indirection layer of conventional money, and the multiple-indirection mappings of options
trades, with some kind of insanely baroque object-relational framework based on the parameterized desires and subjective
experiential values of the players, and as far as the cat is concerned, this makes all such transactions intrinsically
untrustworthy.
Which is why you're stuck here with us apes, Sirhan-prime cynically notes as he spawns an Eliza ghost to carry on nodding at the
cat while he experiences the party.
It's uncomfortably warm in the Atomium sphere – not surprising, there must be thirty people milling around up here, not
counting the waitrons – and several local multicast channels are playing a variety of styles of music to synchronize the mood
swings of the revelers to hardcore techno, waltz, raga ...
"Having a good time, are we?" Sirhan breaks away from integrating one of his timid philosophers and realizes that his glass is
empty, and his mother is grinning alarmingly at him over the rim of a cocktail glass containing something that glows in the
dark. She's wearing spike-heeled boots and a black velvet cat suit that hugs her contours like a second skin, and she's already
getting drunk. In wall-clock years she is younger than Sirhan; it's like having a bizarrely knowing younger sister mysteriously
injected into his life to replace the eigenmother who stayed home and died with the Ring Imperium decades ago. "Look at
you, hiding in a corner at your grandfather's party! Hey, your glass is empty. Want to try this caipirinha? There's someone

you've got to meet over here –"
It's at moments like this that Sirhan really wonders what in Jupiter's orbit his father ever saw in this woman. (But then again,
in the world line this instance of her has returned from, he didn't. So what does that signify?) "As long as there's no
fermented grape juice in it," he says resignedly, allowing himself to be led past a gaggle of conversations and a
mournful-looking gorilla slurping a long drink through a straw. "More of your accelerationista allies?"
"Maybe not." It's the girl gang he avoided noticing in the lift, their eyes sparkling, really getting into this early twen-cen drag
party thing, waving their cigarette holders and cocktail glasses around with wild abandon. "Rita, I'd like you to meet Sirhan,
my other fork's son. Sirhan, this is Rita? She's an historian, too. Why don't you –"
Dark eyes, emphasized not by powder or paint, but by chromatophores inside her skin cells: black hair, chain of enormous
pearls, slim black dress sweeping the floor, a look of mild embarrassment on her heart-shaped face: She could be a clone of
Audrey Hepburn in any other century, "Didn't I just meet you in the elevator?" The embarrassment shifts to her cheeks,
becoming visible.
Sirhan flushes, unsure how to reply. Just then, an interloper arrives on the scene, pushing in between them. "Are you the
curator who reorganized the Precambrian gallery along teleology lines? I've got some things to say about that!" The
interloper is tall, assertive, and blonde. Sirhan hates her from the first sight of her wagging finger.
"Oh shut up, Marissa, this is a party, you've been being a pain all evening." To his surprise, Rita the historian rounds on the
interloper angrily.
"It's not a problem," he manages to say. In the back of his mind, something makes the Rogerian puppet-him that's listening to
the cat sit up and dump-merge a whole lump of fresh memories into his mind – something important, something about the
Vile Offspring sending a starship to bring something back from the router – but the people around him are soaking up so
much attention that he has to file it for later.
"Yes it is a problem," Rita declares. She points at the interloper, who is saying something about the invalidity of teleological
interpretations, trying to justify herself, and says, "Plonk. Phew. Where were we?"
Sirhan blinks. Suddenly everyone but him seems to be ignoring that annoying Marissa person. "What just happened?" he asks
cautiously.
"I killfiled her. Don't tell me, you aren't running Superplonk yet, are you?" Rita flicks a location-cached idea at him and he
takes it cautiously, spawning a couple of specialized Turing Oracles to check it for halting states. It seems to be some kind of
optic lobe hack that accesses a collaborative database of eigenfaces, with some sort of side interface to Broca's region. "Share
and enjoy, confrontation-free parties."
"I've never seen –" Sirhan trails off as he loads the module distractedly. (The cat is rambling on about god modules and
metastatic entanglement and the difficulty of arranging to have personalities custom-grown to order somewhere in the back
of his head, while his fractional-self nods wisely whenever it pauses.) Something like an inner eyelid descends. He looks round;
there's a vague blob at one side of the room, making an annoying buzzing sound. His mother seems to be having an
animated conversation with it. "That's rather interesting."
"Yes, it helps no end at this sort of event." Rita startles him by taking his left arm in hand – her cigarette holder shrivels and
condenses until it's no more than a slight thickening around the wrist of her opera glove – and steers him toward a waitron.
"I'm sorry about your foot, earlier, I was a bit overloaded. Is Amber Macx really your mother?"
"Not exactly, she's my eigenmother," he mumbles. "The reincarnated download of the version who went out to Hyundai
+4904/
-56 aboard the Field Circus. She married a French-Algerian confidence-trick analyst instead of my father, but I think
they divorced a couple of years ago. My real mother married an imam, but they died in the aftermath of Economics 2.0." She
seems to be steering him in the direction of the window bay Amber dragged him away from earlier. "Why do you ask?"
"Because you're not very good at making small talk," Rita says quietly, "and you don't seem very good in crowds. Is that right?
Was it you who performed that amazing dissection of Wittgenstein's cognitive map? The one with the preverbal Gödel string
in it?"
"It was –" He clears his throat. "You thought it was amazing?" Suddenly, on impulse, he detaches a ghost to identify this Rita
person and find out who she is, what she wants. It's not normally worth the effort to get to know someone more closely
than casual small talk, but she seems to have been digging into his background, and he wants to know why. Along with the
him that's chatting to Aineko, that makes about three instances pulling in near-realtime resources. He'll be running up an
existential debt soon if he keeps forking ghosts like this.
"I thought so," she says. There's a bench in front of the wall, and somehow he finds himself sitting on it next to her. There's
no danger, we're not in private or anything, he tells himself stiffly. She's smiling at him, face tilted slightly to one side and lips
parted, and for a moment, a dizzy sense of possibility washes over him: What if she's about to throw all propriety aside? How
undignified! Sirhan believes in self-restraint and dignity. "I was really interested in this –" She passes him another dynamically
loadable blob, encompassing a detailed critique of his analysis of Wittgenstein's matriophobia in the context of gendered
language constructs and nineteenth century Viennese society, along with a hypothesis that leaves Sirhan gasping with mild
indignation at the very idea that he of all people might share Wittgenstein's skewed outlook – "What do you think?" she asks,
grinning impishly at him.

"Nnngk." Sirhan tries to unswallow his tongue. Rita crosses her legs, her gown hissing. "I, ah, that is to say" – At which
moment, his partials re-integrate, dumping a slew of positively pornographic images into his memories. It's a trap! they shriek,
her breasts and hips and pubes – clean-shaven, he can't help noticing – thrusting at him in hotly passionate abandon,
Mother's trying to make you loose like her! and he remembers what it would be like to wake up in bed next to this woman
whom he barely knows after being married to her for a year, because one of his cognitive ghosts has just spent several
seconds of network time (or several subjective months) getting hot and sweaty with a ghost of her own, and she does have
interesting research ideas, even if she's a pushy over-westernized woman who thinks she can run his life for him. "What is
this?" he splutters, his ears growing hot and his garments constricting.
"Just speculating about possibilities. We could get a lot done together." She snakes an arm round his shoulders and pulls him
toward her, gently. "Don't you want to find out if we could work out?"
"But, but –" Sirhan is steaming. Is she offering casual sex? He wonders, profoundly embarrassed by his own inability to read
her signals: "What do you want?" he asks.
"You do know that you can do more with Superplonk than just killfile annoying idiots?" she whispers in his ear. "We can be
invisible right now, if you like. It's great for confidential meetings – other things, too. We can work beautifully together, our
ghosts annealed really well ..."
Sirhan jumps up, his face stinging, and turns away: "No thank you!" he snaps, angry at himself. "Goodbye!" His other
instances, interrupted by his broadcast emotional overload, are distracted from their tasks and sputtering with indignation.
Her hurt expression is too much for him: The killfile snaps down, blurring her into an indistinct black blob on the wall,
veiled by his own brain as he turns and walks away, seething with anger at his mother for being so unfair as to make him
behold his own face in the throes of fleshy passion.

Meanwhile, in one of the lower spheres, padded with silvery blue insulating pillows bound together with duct tape, the
movers and shakers of the accelerationista faction are discussing their bid for world power at fractional-C velocities.
"We can't outrun everything. For example, a collapse of the false vacuum," Manfred insists, slightly uncoordinated and
slurring his vowels under the influence of the first glass of fruit punch he's experienced in nigh-on twenty real-time years. His
body is young and still relatively featureless, hair still growing out, and he's abandoned his old no-implants fetish at last to
adopt an array of interfaces that let him internalize all the exocortex processes that he formerly ran on an array of dumb
Turing machines outside his body. He's standing on his own sense of style and is the only person in the room who isn't
wearing some variation of dinner jacket or classical evening dress. "Entangled exchange via routers is all very well, but it
won't let us escape the universe itself – any phase change will catch up eventually, the network must have an end. And then
where will we be, Sameena?"
"I'm not disputing that." The woman he's talking to, wearing a green-and-gold sari and a medieval maharajah's ransom in gold
and natural diamonds, nods thoughtfully. "But it hasn't happened yet, and we've got evidence that superhuman intelligences
have been loose in this universe for gigayears, so there's a fair bet that the worst catastrophe scenarios are unlikely. And
looking closer to home, we don't know what the routers are for, or who made them. Until then ..." She shrugs. "Look what
happened last time somebody tried to probe them. No offense intended."
"It's already happened. If what I hear is correct, the Vile Offspring aren't nearly as negative about the idea of using the
routers as we old-fashioned metahumans might like to believe." Manfred frowns, trying to recall some hazy anecdote – he's
experimenting with a new memory compression algorithm, necessitated by his pack rat mnemonic habits when younger, and
sometimes the whole universe feels as if it's nearly on the tip of his tongue. "So, we seem to be in violent agreement about the
need to know more about what's going on, and to find out what they're doing out there. We've got cosmic background
anisotropies caused by the waste heat from computing processes millions of light-years across – it takes a big interstellar
civilization to do that, and they don't seem to have fallen into the same rat trap as the local Matrioshka brain civilizations.
And we've got worrying rumors about the VO messing around with the structure of space-time in order to find a way
around the Beckenstein bound. If the VO are trying that, then the folks out near the supercluster already know the answers.
The best way to find out what's happening is to go and talk to whoever's responsible. Can we at least agree on that?"
"Probably not." Her eyes glitter with amusement. "It all depends on whether one believes in these civilizations in the first
place. I know your people point to deep-field camera images going all the way back to some wonky hubble-bubble scrying
mirror from the late twentieth, but we've got no evidence except some theories about the Casimir effect and pair
production and spinning beakers of helium-3 – much less proof that whole bunch of alien galactic civilizations are trying to
collapse the false vacuum and destroy the universe!" Her voice dropped a notch: "At least, not enough proof to convince
most people, Manny dear. I know this comes as a shock to you, but not everyone is a neophiliac posthuman bodysurfer whose
idea of a sabbatical is to spend twenty years as a flock of tightly networked seagulls in order to try and to prove the Turing
Oracle thesis –"
"Not everyone is concerned with the deep future," Manfred interrupts. "It's important! If we live or die, that doesn't matter –
that's not the big picture. The big question is whether information originating in our light cone is preserved, or whether
we're stuck in a lossy medium where our very existence counts for nothing. It's downright embarrassing to be a member of a
species with such a profound lack of curiosity about its own future, especially when it affects us all personally! I mean, if
there's going to come a time when there's nobody or nothing to remember us then what does –"
"Manfred?"

He stops in midsentence, his mouth open, staring dumbly.
It's Amber, poised in black cat suit with cocktail glass. Her expression is open and confused, appallingly vulnerable. Blue
liquid slops, almost spilling out of her glass – the rim barely extends itself in time to catch the drops. Behind her stands
Annette, a deeply self-satisfied smile on her face.
"You." Amber pauses, her cheek twitching as bits of her mind page in and out of her skull, polling external information
sources. "You really are –"
A hasty cloud materializes under her hand as her fingers relax, dropping the glass.
"Uh." Manfred stares, at a complete loss for words. "I'd, uh." After a moment he looks down. "I'm sorry. I'll get you another
drink ..?"
"Why didn't someone warn me?" Amber complains.
"We thought you could use the good advice," Annette stated into the awkward silence. "And a family reunion. It was meant
to be a surprise."
"A surprise." Amber looks perplexed. "You could say that."
"You're taller than I was expecting," Manfred says unexpectedly. "People look different when you're not using human eyes."
"Yeah?" She looks at him, and he turns his head slightly, facing her. It's a historic moment, and Annette is getting it all on
memory diamond, from every angle. The family's dirty little secret is that Amber and her father have never met, not
face-to-face in physical meat-machine proximity. She was born years after Manfred and Pamela separated, after all, decanted
prefertilized from a tank of liquid nitrogen. This is the first time either of them have actually seen the other's face without
electronic intermediation. And while they've said everything that needed to be said on a businesslike level, anthropoid family
politics is still very much a matter of body language and pheromones. "How long have you been out and about?" she asks,
trying to disguise her confusion.
"About six hours." Manfred manages a rueful chuckle, trying to take the sight of her in all at once. "Let's get you another
drink and put our heads together?"
"Okay." Amber takes a deep breath and glares at Annette. "You set this up, you clean up the mess."
Annette just stands there smiling at the confusion of her accomplishment.
***
The cold light of dawn finds Sirhan angry, sober, and ready to pick a fight with the first person who comes through the
door of his office. The room is about ten meters across, with a floor of polished marble and skylights in the intricately
plastered ceiling. The walkthrough of his current project sprouts in the middle of the floor like a ghostly abstract cauliflower,
fractal branches dwindling down to infolded nodes tagged with compressed identifiers. The branches expand and shrink as
Sirhan paces around it, zooming to readability in response to his eyeball dynamics. But he isn't paying it much attention.
He's too disturbed, uncertain, trying to work out whom to blame. Which is why, when the door bangs open, his first
response is to whirl angrily and open his mouth – then stop. "What do you want?" he demands.
"A word, if you please?" Annette looks around distractedly. "This is your project?"
"Yes," he says icily, and banishes the walkthrough with a wave of one hand. "What do you want?"
"I'm not sure." Annette pauses. For a moment she looks weary, tired beyond mortal words, and Sirhan momentarily wonders
if perhaps he's spreading the blame too far. This ninetysomething Frenchwoman who is no blood relative, who was in years
past the love of his scatterbrained grandfather's life, seems the least likely person to be trying to manipulate him, at least in
such an unwelcome and intimate manner. But there's no telling. Families are strange things, and even though the current
instantiations of his father and mother aren't the ones who ran his pre-adolescent brain through a couple of dozen
alternative lifelines before he was ten, he can't be sure – or that they wouldn't enlist Tante Annette's assistance in fucking
with his mind. "We need to talk about your mother," she continues.
"We do, do we?" Sirhan turns around and sees the vacancy of the room for what it is, a socket, like a pulled tooth, informed
as much by what is absent as by what is present. He snaps his fingers, and an intricate bench of translucent bluish utility fog
congeals out of the air behind him. He sits: Annette can do what she wants.
"Oui." She thrusts her hands deep into the pocket of the peasant smock she's wearing – a major departure from her normal
style – and leans against the wall. Physically, she looks young enough to have spent her entire life blitzing around the galaxy
at three nines of lightspeed, but her posture is world-weary and ancient. History is a foreign country, and the old are
unwilling emigrants, tired out by the constant travel. "Your mother, she has taken on a huge job, but it's one that needs
doing. You agreed it needed doing, years ago, with the archive store. She is now trying to get it moving, that is what the
campaign is about, to place before the electors a choice of how best to move an entire civilization. So I ask, why do you
obstruct her?"
Sirhan works his jaw; he feels like spitting. "Why?" he snaps.

"Yes. Why?" Annette gives in and magics up a chair from the swirling fogbank beneath the ceiling. She crouches in it, staring
at him. "It is a question."
"I have nothing against her political machinations," Sirhan says tensely. "But her uninvited interference in my personal life –"
"What interference?"
He stares. "Is that a question?" He's silent for a moment. Then: "Throwing that wanton at me last night –"
Annette stares at him. "Who? What are you talking about?"
"That, that loose woman!" Sirhan is reduced to spluttering. "False pretenses! If this is one of Father's matchmaking ideas, it is
so very wrong that –"
Annette is shaking her head. "Are you crazy? Your mother simply wanted you to meet her campaign team, to join in
planning the policy. Your father is not on this planet! But you stormed out, you really upset Rita, did you know that? Rita,
she is the best belief maintenance and story construction operative I have! Yet you to tears reduce her. What is wrong with
you?"
"I –" Sirhan swallows. "She's what?" he asks again, his mouth dry. "I thought ..." He trails off. He doesn't want to say what he
thought. The hussy, that brazen trollop, is part of his mother's campaign party? Not some plot to lure him into corruption?
What if it was all a horrible misunderstanding?
"I think you need to apologize to someone," Annette says coolly, standing up. Sirhan's head is spinning between a dozen
dialogues of actors and ghosts, a journal of the party replaying before his ghast-stricken inner gaze. Even the walls have
begun to flicker, responding to his intense unease. Annette skewers him with a disgusted look: "When you can a woman
behave toward as a person, not a threat, we can again talk. Until then." And she stands up and walks out of the room,
leaving him to contemplate the shattered stump of his anger, so startled he can barely concentrate on his project, thinking, Is
that really me? Is that what I look like to her? as the cladistic graph slowly rotates before him, denuded branches spread wide,
waiting to be filled with the nodes of the alien interstellar network just as soon as he can convince Aineko to stake him the
price of the depth-first tour of darkness.
***
Manfred used to be a flock of pigeons – literally, his exocortex dispersed among a passel of bird brains, pecking at brightly
colored facts, shitting semidigested conclusions. Being human again feels inexplicably odd, even without the added distractions
of his sex drive, which he has switched off until he gets used to being unitary again. Not only does he get shooting pains in
his neck whenever he tries to look over his left shoulder with his right eye, but he's lost the habit of spawning exocortical
agents to go interrogate a database or bush robot or something, then report back to him. Instead he keeps trying to fly off
in all directions at once, which usually ends with him falling over.
But at present, that's not a problem. He's sitting comfortably at a weathered wooden table in a beer garden behind a hall
lifted from somewhere like Frankfurt, a liter glass of straw-colored liquid at his elbow and a comforting multiple whispering of
knowledge streams tickling the back of his head. Most of his attention is focused on Annette, who frowns at him with mingled
concern and affection. They may have lived separate lives for almost a third of a century, since she declined to upload with
him, but he's still deeply attuned to her.
"You are going to have to do something about that boy," she says sympathetically. "He is close enough to upset Amber. And
without Amber, there will be a problem."
"I'm going to have to do something about Amber, too," Manfred retorts. "What was the idea, not warning her I was coming?"
"It was meant to be a surprise." Annette comes as close to pouting as Manfred's seen her recently. It brings back warm
memories; he reaches out to hold her hand across the table.
"You know I can't handle the human niceties properly when I'm a flock." He strokes the back of her wrist. She pulls back
after a while, but slowly. "I expected you to manage all that stuff."
"That stuff." Annette shakes her head. "She's your daughter, you know? Did you have no curiosity left?"
"As a bird?" Manfred cocks his head to one side so abruptly that he hurts his neck and winces. "Nope. Now I do, but I think I
pissed her off –"
"Which brings us back to point one."
"I'd send her an apology, but she'd think I was trying to manipulate her" – Manfred takes a mouthful of beer – "and she'd be
right." He sounds slightly depressed. "All my relationships are screwy this decade. And it's lonely."
"So? Don't brood." Annette pulls her hand back. "Something will sort itself out eventually. And in the short term, there is
the work, the electoral problem becomes acute." When she's around him the remains of her once-strong French accent
almost vanish in a transatlantic drawl, he realizes with a pang. He's been abhuman for too long – people who meant a lot to
him have changed while he's been away.

"I'll brood if I want to," he says. "I didn't ever really get a chance to say goodbye to Pam, did I? Not after that time in Paris
when the gangsters ..." He shrugs. "I'm getting nostalgic in my old age." He snorts.
"You're not the only one," Annette says tactfully. "Social occasions here are a minefield, one must tiptoe around so many
issues, people have too much, too much history. And nobody knows everything that is going on."
"That's the trouble with this damned polity." Manfred takes another gulp of hefeweisen. "We've already got six million people
living on this planet, and it's growing like the first-generation Internet. Everyone who is anyone knows everyone, but there
are so many incomers diluting the mix and not knowing that there is a small world network here that everything is up for
grabs again after only a couple of megaseconds. New networks form, and we don't even know they exist until they sprout a
political agenda and surface under us. We're acting under time pressure. If we don't get things rolling now, we'll never be
able to ..." He shakes his head. "It wasn't like this for you in Brussels, was it?"
"No. Brussels was a mature system. And I had Gianni to look after in his dotage after you left. It will only get worse from
here on in, I think."
"Democracy 2.0." He shudders briefly. "I'm not sure about the validity of voting projects at all, these days. The assumption
that all people are of equal importance seems frighteningly obsolescent. Do you think we can make this fly?"
"I don't see why not. If Amber's willing to play the People's Princess for us ..." Annette picks up a slice of liverwurst and
chews on it meditatively.
"I'm not sure it's workable, however we play it." Manfred looks thoughtful. "The whole democratic participation thing looks
questionable to me under these circumstances. We're under direct threat, for all that it's a long-term one, and this whole
culture is in danger of turning into a classical nation-state. Or worse, several of them layered on top of one another with
complete geographical collocation but no social interpenetration. I'm not certain it's a good idea to try to steer something
like that – pieces might break off, you'd get the most unpleasant side-effects. Although, on the other hand, if we can mobilize
enough broad support to become the first visible planetwide polity ..."
"We need you to stay focused," Annette adds unexpectedly.
"Focused? Me?" He laughs, briefly. "I used to have an idea a second. Now it's maybe one a year. I'm just a melancholy old
birdbrain, me."
"Yes, but you know the old saying? The fox has many ideas – the hedgehog has only one, but it's a big idea."
"So tell me, what is my big idea?" Manfred leans forward, one elbow on the table, one eye focused on inner space as a
hot-burning thread of consciousness barks psephological performance metrics at him, analysing the game ahead. "Where do
you think I'm going?"
"I think –" Annette breaks off suddenly, staring past his shoulder. Privacy slips, and for a frozen moment Manfred glances
round in mild horror and sees thirty or forty other guests in the crowded garden, elbows rubbing, voices raised above the
background chatter: "Gianni!" She beams widely as she stands up. "What a surprise! When did you arrive?"
Manfred blinks. A slim young guy, moving with adolescent grace, but none of the awkward movements and sullen lack of
poise – he's much older than he looks, chickenhawk genetics. Gianni? He feels a huge surge of memories paging through his
exocortex. He remembers ringing a doorbell in dusty, hot Rome: white toweling bathrobe, the economics of scarcity,
autograph signed by the dead hand of von Neumann – "Gianni?" he asks, disbelieving. "It's been a long time!"
The gilded youth, incarnated in the image of a metropolitan toy-boy from the noughties, grins widely and embraces Manfred
with a friendly bear hug. Then he slides down onto the bench next to Annette, whom he kisses with easy familiarity. "Ah, to
be among friends again! It's been too long!" He glances round curiously. "Hmm, how very Bavarian." He snaps his fingers.
"Mine will be a, what do you recommend? It's been too long since my last beer." His grin widens. "Not in this body."
"You're resimulated?" Manfred asks, unable to stop himself.
Annette frowns at him disapprovingly: "No, silly! He came through the teleport gate –"
"Oh." Manfred shakes his head. "I'm sorry –"
"It's okay." Gianni Vittoria clearly doesn't mind being mistaken for a historical newbie, rather than someone who's traveled
through the decades the hard way. He must be over a hundred by now, Manfred notes, not bothering to spawn a search thread
to find out.
"It was time to move and, well, the old body didn't want to move with me, so why not go gracefully and accept the
inevitable?"
"I didn't take you for a dualist," Manfred says ruefully.
"Ah, I'm not – but neither am I reckless." Gianni drops his grin for a moment. The sometime minister for transhuman affairs,
economic theoretician, then retired tribal elder of the polycognitive liberals is serious. "I have never uploaded before, or
switched bodies, or teleported. Even when my old one was seriously – tcha! Maybe I left it too long. But here I am, one
planet is as good as another to be cloned and downloaded onto, don't you think?"

"You invited him?" Manfred asks Annette.
"Why wouldn't I?" There's a wicked gleam in her eye. "Did you expect me to live like a nun while you were a flock of
pigeons? We may have campaigned against the legal death of the transubstantiated, Manfred, but there are limits."
Manfred looks between them, then shrugs, embarrassed. "I'm still getting used to being human again," he admits. "Give me
time to catch up? At an emotional level, at least." The realization that Gianni and Annette have a history together doesn't
come as a surprise to him: It's one of the things you must adapt to if you opt out of the human species, after all. At least the
libido suppression is helping here, he realizes: He's not about to embarrass anyone by suggesting a ménage. He focuses on
Gianni. "I have a feeling I'm here for a purpose, and it isn't mine," he says slowly. "Why don't you tell me what you've got in
mind?"
Gianni shrugs. "You have the big picture already. We are human, metahuman, and augmented human. But the posthumans
are things that were never really human to begin with. The Vile Offspring have reached their adolescence and want the place
to themselves so they can throw a party. The writing is on the wall, don't you think?"
Manfred gives him a long stare. "The whole idea of running away in meatspace is fraught with peril," he says slowly. He picks
up his mug of beer and swirls it around slowly. "Look, we know, now, that a singularity doesn't turn into a voracious
predator that eats all the dumb matter in its path, triggering a phase change in the structure of space – at least, not unless
they've done something very stupid to the structure of the false vacuum, somewhere outside our current light cone.
"But if we run away, we are still going to be there. Sooner or later, we'll have the same problem all over again; runaway
intelligence augmentation, self-expression, engineered intelligences, whatever. Possibly that's what happened out past the
Böotes void – not a galactic-scale civilization, but a race of pathological cowards fleeing their own exponential transcendence.
We carry the seeds of a singularity with us wherever we go, and if we try to excise those seeds, we cease to be human, don't
we? So ... maybe you can tell me what you think we should do. Hmm?"
"It's a dilemma." A waitron inserts itself into their privacy-screened field of view. It plants a spun-diamond glass in front of
Gianni, then pukes beer into it. Manfred declines a refill, waiting for Gianni to drink. "Ah, the simple pleasures of the flesh!
I've been corresponding with your daughter, Manny. She loaned me her experiential digest of the journey to Hyundai
+4904/ . I found it quite alarming. Nobody's casting aspersions on her observations, not after that self-propelled stock
-56
market bubble or 419 scam or whatever it was got loose in the Economics 2.0 sphere, but the implications – the Vile
Offspring will eat the solar system, Manny. Then they'll slow down. But where does that leave us, I ask you? What is there for
orthohumans like us to do?"
Manfred nods thoughtfully. "You've heard the argument between the accelerationistas and the time-binder faction, I assume?"
he asks.
"Of course." Gianni takes a long pull on his beer. "What do you think of our options?"
"The accelerationistas want to upload everyone onto a fleet of starwisps and charge off to colonize an uninhabited brown
dwarf planetary system. Or maybe steal a Matrioshka brain that's succumbed to senile dementia and turn it back into
planetary biomes with cores of diamond-phase computronium to fulfil some kind of demented pastoralist nostalgia trip.
Rousseau's universal robots. I gather Amber thinks this is a good idea because she's done it before – at least, the charging off
aboard a starwisp part. 'To boldly go where no uploaded metahuman colony fleet has gone before' has a certain ring to it,
doesn't it?" Manfred nods to himself. "Like I say, it won't work. We'd be right back to iteration one of the waterfall model of
singularity formation within a couple of gigaseconds of arriving. That's why I came back: to warn her."
"So?" Gianni prods, pretending to ignore the frowns that Annette is casting his way.
"And as for the time-binders," Manfred nods again, "they're like Sirhan. Deeply conservative, deeply suspicious. Holding out
for staying here as long as possible, until the Vile Offspring come for Saturn – then moving out bit by bit, into the Kuiper
belt. Colony habitats on snowballs half a light-year from anywhere." He shudders. "Spam in a fucking can with a light-hour
walk to the nearest civilized company if your fellow inmates decide to reinvent Stalinism or Objectivism. No thanks! I know
they've been muttering about quantum teleportation and stealing toys from the routers, but I'll believe it when I see it."
"Which leaves what?" Annette demands. "It is all very well, this dismissal of both the accelerationista and time-binder
programs, Manny, but what can you propose in their place?" She looks distressed. "Fifty years ago, you would have had six
new ideas before breakfast! And an erection."
Manfred leers at her unconvincingly. "Who says I can't still have both?"
She glares. "Drop it!"
"Okay." Manfred chugs back a quarter of a liter of beer, draining his glass, and puts it down on the table with a bang. "As it
happens, I do have an alternative idea." He looks serious. "I've been discussing it with Aineko for some time, and Aineko has
been seeding Sirhan with it – if it's to work optimally, we'll need to get a rump constituency of both the accelerationistas and
the conservatives on board. Which is why I'm conditionally going along with this whole election nonsense. So, what's it worth
to you for me to explain it?"

"So, who was the deadhead you were busy with today?" asks Amber.
Rita shrugs. "Some boringly prolix pulp author from the early twentieth, with a body phobia of extropian proportions – I
kept expecting him to start drooling and rolling his eyes if I crossed my legs. Funny thing is, he was also close to bolting from
fear once I mentioned implants. We really need to nail down how to deal with these mind/body dualists, don't we?" She
watches Amber with something approaching admiration; she's new to the inner circle of the accelerationista study faction,
and Amber's social credit is sky-high. Rita's got a lot to learn from her, if she can get close enough. And right now, following
her along a path through the landscaped garden behind the museum seems like a golden moment of opportunity.
Amber smiles. "I'm glad I'm not processing immigrants these days; most of them are so stupid it drives you up the wall after a
bit. Personally I blame the Flynn effect – in reverse. They come from a background of sensory deprivation. It's nothing that a
course of neural growth enhancers can't fix in a year or two, but after the first few you skullfuck, they're all the same. So
dull. Unless you're unlucky enough to get one of the documentees from a puritan religious period. I'm no fluffragette, but I
swear if I get one more superstitious, woman-hating clergyman, I'm going to consider prescribing forcible gender
reassignment surgery. At least the Victorian English are mostly just open-minded lechers, when you get past their social
reserve. And they like new technology."
Rita nods. Woman-hating et cetera ... The echoes of patriarchy are still with them today, it seems, and not just in the form of
resimulated ayatollahs and archbishops from the Dark Ages. "My author sounds like the worst of both. Some guy called
Howard, from Rhode Island. Kept looking at me as if he was afraid I was going to sprout bat wings and tentacles or
something." Like your son, she doesn't add. Just what was he thinking, anyway? she wonders. To be that screwed up takes serious
dedication ... "What are you working on, if you don't mind me asking?" she asks, trying to change the direction of her
attention.
"Oh, pressing the flesh, I guess. Auntie 'Nette wanted me to meet some old political hack contact of hers who she figures can
help with the program, but he was holed up with her and Dad all day." She pulls a face. "I had another fitting session with
the image merchants, they're trying to turn me into a political catwalk clotheshorse. Then there's the program demographics
again. We're getting about a thousand new immigrants a day, planetwide, but it's accelerating rapidly, and we should be up
to eighty an hour by the time of the election. Which is going to be a huge problem, because if we start campaigning too
early, a quarter of the electorate won't know what they're meant to be voting about."
"Maybe it's deliberate," Rita suggests. "The Vile Offspring are trying to rig the outcome by injecting voters." She pings a smiley
emoticon off Wednesday's open channel, raising a flickering grin in return. "The party of fuckwits will win, no question about
it."
"Uh-huh." Amber snaps her fingers and pulls an impatient face as she waits for a passing cloud to solidify above her head and
lower a glass of cranberry juice to her. "Dad said one thing that's spot-on, we're framing this entire debate in terms of what
we should do to avoid conflict with the Offspring. The main bone of contention is how to run away and how far to go and
which program to put resources into, not whether or when to run, let alone what else we could do. Maybe we should have
given it some more thought. Are we being manipulated?"
Rita looks vacant for a moment. "Is that a question?" she asks. Amber nods, and she shakes her head. "Then I'd have to say
that I don't know. The evidence is inconclusive, so far. But I'm not really happy. The Offspring won't tell us what they want,
but there's no reason to believe they don't know what we want. I mean, they can think rings round us, can't they?"
Amber shrugs, then pauses to unlatch a hedge gate that gives admission to a maze of sweet-smelling shrubs. "I really don't
know. They may not care about us, or even remember we exist – the resimulants may be being generated by some
autonomic mechanism, not really part of the higher consciousness of the Offspring. Or it may be some whacked-out
post-Tiplerite meme that's gotten hold of more processing resources than the entire presingularity Net, some kind of
MetaMormon project directed at ensuring that everyone who can possibly ever have lived lives in the right way to fit some
weird quasi-religious requirement we don't know about. Or it might be a message we're simply not smart enough to decode.
That's the trouble, we don't know."
She vanishes around the curve of the maze. Rita hurries to catch up, sees her about to turn into another alleyway, and leaps
after her. "What else?" she pants.
"Could be" – left turn – "anything, really." Six steps lead down into a shadowy tunnel; fork right, five meters forward, then
six steps up lead back to the surface. "Question is, why don't they" – left turn – "just tell us what they want?"
"Speaking to tapeworms." Rita nearly manages to catch up with Amber, who is trotting through the maze as if she's
memorized it perfectly. "That's how much the nascent Matrioshka brain can outthink us by, as humans to segmented worms.
Would we do. What they told us?"
"Maybe." Amber stops dead, and Rita glances around. They're in an open cell near the heart of the maze, five meters square,
hedged in on all sides. There are three entrances and a slate altar, waist high, lichen-stained with age. "I think you know the
answer to that question."
"I –" Rita stares at her.
Amber stares back, eyes dark and intense. "You're from one of the Ganymede orbitals by way of Titan. You knew my
eigensister while I was out of the solar system flying a diamond the size of a Coke can. That's what you told me. You've got a
skill set that's a perfect match for the campaign research group, and you asked me to introduce you to Sirhan, then you

pushed his buttons like a pro. Just what are you trying to pull? Why should I trust you?"
"I –" Rita's face crumples. "I didn't push his buttons! He thought I was trying to drag him into bed." She looks up defiantly. "I
wasn't, I want to learn, what makes you – him – work –" Huge, dark, structured information queries batter at her
exocortex, triggering warnings. Someone is churning through distributed time-series databases all over the outer system,
measuring her past with a micrometer. She stares at Amber, mortified and angry. It's the ultimate denial of trust, the need to
check her statements against the public record for truth. "What are you doing?"
"I have a suspicion." Amber stands poised, as if ready to run. Run away from me? Rita thinks, startled. "You said, what if the
resimulants came from a subconscious function of the Offspring? And funnily enough, I've been discussing that possibility with
Dad. He's still got the spark when you show him a problem, you know."
"I don't understand!"
"No, I don't think you do," says Amber, and Rita can feel vast stresses in the space around her: The whole ubicomp
environment, dust-sized chips and utility fog and hazy clouds of diamond-bright optical processors in the soil and the air
and her skin, is growing blotchy and sluggish, thrashing under the load of whatever Amber – with her management-grade
ackles – is ordering it to do. For a moment, Rita can't feel half her mind, and she gets the panicky claustrophobic sense of
being trapped inside her own head: Then it stops.
"Tell me!" Rita insists. "What are you trying to prove? It's some mistake –" And Amber is nodding, much to her surprise,
looking weary and morose. "What do you think I've done?"
"Nothing. You're coherent. Sorry about that."
"Coherent?" Rita hears her voice rising with her indignation as she feels bits of herself, cut off from her for whole seconds,
shivering with relief. "I'll give you coherent! Assaulting my exocortex –"
"Shut up." Amber rubs her face and simultaneously throws Rita one end of an encrypted channel.
"Why should I?" Rita demands, not accepting the handshake.
"Because." Amber glances round. She's scared! Rita suddenly realizes. "Just do it," she hisses.
Rita accepts the endpoint and a huge lump of undigested expository data slides down it, structured and tagged with entry
points and metainformation directories pointing to –
"Holy shit!" she whispers, as she realizes what it is.
"Yes." Amber grins humorlessly. She continues, over the open channel: It looks like they're cognitive antibodies,
generated by the devil's own semiotic immune system. That's what Sirhan is focusing on, how to
avoid triggering them and bringing everything down at once. Forget the election, we're going to be in
deep shit sooner rather than later, and we're still trying to work out how to survive. Now are you sure
you still want in?
"Want in on what?" Rita asks, shakily.
The lifeboat Dad's trying to get us all into under cover of the accelerationista/conservationista split,
before the Vile Offspring's immune system figures out how to lever us apart into factions and make us
kill each other ...

Welcome to the afterglow of the intelligence supernova, little tapeworm.
Tapeworms have on the order of a thousand neurons, pulsing furiously to keep their little bodies twitching.
Human beings have on the order of a hundred billion neurons. What is happening in the inner solar system
as the Vile Offspring churn and reconfigure the fast-thinking structured dust clouds that were once planets is
as far beyond the ken of merely human consciousness as the thoughts of a Gödel are beyond the twitching
tropisms of a worm. Personality modules bounded by the speed of light, sucking down billions of times the
processing power of a human brain, form and re-form in the halo of glowing nanoprocessors that shrouds
the sun in a ruddy glowing cloud.
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Ceres and the asteroids – all gone. Luna is a silvery iridescent sphere, planed smooth
down to micrometer heights, luminous with diffraction patterns. Only Earth, the cradle of human civilization,
remains untransformed; and Earth, too, will be dismantled soon enough, for already a trellis of space
elevators webs the planet around its equator, lifting refugee dumb matter into orbit and flinging it at the
wildlife preserves of the outer system.
The intelligence bloom that gnaws at Jupiter's moons with claws of molecular machinery won't stop until it
runs out of dumb matter to convert into computronium. By the time it does, it will have as much
brainpower as you'd get if you placed a planet with a population of six billion future-shocked primates in
orbit around every star in the Milky Way galaxy. But right now, it's still stupid, having converted barely a

percentage point of the mass of the solar system – it's a mere Magellanic Cloud civilization, infantile and
unsubtle and still perilously close to its carbon-chemistry roots.
It's hard for tapeworms living in warm intestinal mulch to wrap their thousand-neuron brains around
whatever it is that the vastly more complex entities who host them are discussing, but one thing's sure – the
owners have a lot of things going on, not all of them under conscious control. The churning of gastric
secretions and the steady ventilation of lungs are incomprehensible to the simple brains of tapeworms, but
they serve the purpose of keeping the humans alive and provide the environment the worms live in. And
other more esoteric functions that contribute to survival – the intricate dance of specialized cloned
lymphocytes in their bone marrow and lymph nodes, the random permutations of antibodies constantly
churning for possible matches to intruder molecules warning of the presence of pollution – are all going on
beneath the level of conscious control.
Autonomic defenses. Antibodies. Intelligence bloom gnawing at the edges of the outer system. And humans
are not as unsophisticated as mulch wrigglers, they can see the writing on the wall. Is it any surprise, that
among the ones who look outward, the real debate is not over whether to run, but over how far and how
fast?
***

There's a team meeting early the next morning. It's still dark outside, and most of the attendees who are present in vivo have
the faintly haggard look that comes from abusing melatonin antagonists. Rita stifles a yawn as she glances around the
conference room – the walls expanded into huge virtual spaces to accommodate thirty or so exocortical ghosts from
sleeping partners who will wake with memories of a particularly vivid lucid dream – and sees Amber talking to her famous
father and a younger-looking man who one of her partials recognizes as a last-century EU politician. There seems to be some
tension between them.
Now that Amber has granted Rita her conditional trust, a whole new tier of campaigning information has opened up to her
inner eye – stuff steganographically concealed in a hidden layer of the project's collective memory space. There's stuff in here
she hadn't suspected, frightening studies of resimulant demographics, surveys of emigration rates from the inner system,
cladistic trees dissecting different forms of crude tampering that have been found skulking in the wetware of refugees. The
reason why Amber and Manfred and – reluctantly – Sirhan are fighting for one radical faction in a planetwide election,
despite their various misgivings over the validity of the entire concept of democracy in this posthuman era. She blinks it
aside, slightly bewildered, forking a couple of dozen personality subthreads to chew on it at the edges. "Need coffee," she
mutters to the table, as it offers her a chair.
"Everyone on-line?" asked Manfred. "Then I'll begin." He looks tired and worried, physically youthful but showing the full
weight of his age. "We've got a crisis coming, folks. About a hundred kiloseconds ago, the bit rate on the resimulation stream
jumped. We're now fielding about one resimulated state vector a second, on top of the legitimate immigration we're dealing
with. If it jumps again by the same factor, it's going to swamp our ability to check the immigrants for zimboes in vivo – we'd
have to move to running them in secure storage or just resurrecting them blind, and if there are any jokers in the pack,
that's about the riskiest thing we could do."
"Why do you not spool them to memory diamond?" asks the handsome young ex-politician to his left, looking almost amused
– as if he already knows the answer.
"Politics." Manfred shrugs.
"It would blow a hole in our social contract," says Amber, looking as if she's just swallowed something unpleasant, and Rita
feels a flicker of admiration for the way they're stage-managing the meeting. Amber's even talking to her father, as if she feels
comfortable with him around, although he's a walking reminder of her own lack of success. Nobody else has gotten a word
in yet. "If we don't instantiate them, the next logical step is to deny resimulated minds the franchise. Which in turn puts us
on the road to institutional inequality. And that's a very big step to take, even if you have misgivings about the idea of
settling complex policy issues on the basis of a popular vote, because our whole polity is based on the idea that less
competent intelligences – us – deserve consideration."
"Hrmph." Someone clears their throat. Rita glances round and freezes, because it's Amber's screwed-up eigenchild, and he's
just about materialized in the chair next to her. So he adopted Superplonk after all? she observes cynically. He doggedly avoids
looking at her. "That was my analysis," he says reluctantly. "We need them alive. For the ark option, at least, and if not, even
the accelerationista platform will need them on hand later."
Concentration camps, thinks Rita, trying to ignore Sirhan's presence near her, for it's a constant irritant, where most of the
inmates are confused, frightened human beings – and the ones who aren't think they are. It's an eerie thought, and she spawns a
couple of full ghosts to dream it through for her, gaming the possible angles.
"How are your negotiations over the lifeboat designs going?" Amber asks her father. "We need to get a portfolio of design
schemata out before we go into the election –"
"Change of plan." Manfred hunches forward. "This doesn't need to go any further, but Sirhan and Aineko have come up with
something interesting." He looks worried.
Sirhan is staring at his eigenmother with narrowed eyes, and Rita has to resist the urge to elbow him savagely in the ribs. She

knows enough about him now to realize it wouldn't get his attention – at least, not the way she'd want it, not for the right
reasons – and in any case, he's more wrapped up in himself than her ghost ever saw him as likely to be. (How anyone could
be party to such a detailed exchange of simulated lives and still reject the opportunity to do it in real life is beyond her;
unless it's an artifact of his youth, when his parents pushed him through a dozen simulated childhoods in search of
knowledge and ended up with a stubborn oyster-head of a son ...) "We still need to look as if we're planning on using a
lifeboat," he says aloud. "There's the small matter of the price they're asking in return for the alternative."
"What? What are you talking about?" Amber sounds confused. "I thought you were working on some kind of cladistic map.
What's this about a price?"
Sirhan smiles coolly. "I am working on a cladistic map, in a manner of speaking. You wasted much of your opportunity when
you journeyed to the router, you know. I've been talking to Aineko."
"You –" Amber flushes. "What about?" She's visibly angry, Rita notices. Sirhan is needling his eigenmother. Why?
"About the topology of some rather interesting types of small-world network." Sirhan leans back in his chair, watching the
cloud above her head. "And the router. You went through it, then you came back with your tail between your legs as fast as
you could, didn't you? Not even checking your passenger to see if it was a hostile parasite."
"I don't have to take this," Amber says tightly. "You weren't there, and you have no idea what constraints we were working
under."
"Really?" Sirhan raises an eyebrow. "Anyway, you missed an opportunity. We know that the routers – for whatever reason –
are self-replicating. They spread from brown dwarf to brown dwarf, hatch, tap the protostar for energy and material, and
send a bunch of children out. Von Neumann machines, in other words. We also know that they provide high-bandwidth
communications to other routers. When you went through the one at Hyundai +4904/ -56, you ended up in an
unmaintained DMZ attached to an alien Matrioshka brain that had degenerated, somehow. It follows that someone had
collected a router and carried it home, to link into the MB. So why didn't you bring one home with you?"
Amber glares at him. "Total payload on board the Field Circus was about ten grams. How large do you think a router
seed is?"
"So you brought the Slug home instead, occupying maybe half your storage capacity and ready to wreak seven shades of
havoc on –"
"Children!" They both look round automatically. It's Annette, Rita realizes, and she doesn't look amused. "Why do you not
save this bickering for later?" she asks. "We have our own goals to be pursuing." Unamused is an understatement. Annette is
fuming.
"This charming family reunion was your idea, I believe?" Manfred smiles at her, then nods coolly at the retread EU politician
in the next seat.
"Please." It's Amber. "Dad, can you save this for later?" Rita sits up. For a moment, Amber looks ancient, far older than her
subjective gigasecond of age. "She's right. She didn't mean to screw up. Let's leave the family history for some time when we
can work it out in private. Okay?"
Manfred looks abashed. He blinks rapidly. "All right." He takes a breath. "Amber, I brought some old acquaintances into the
loop. If we win the election, then to get out of here as fast as possible, we'll have to use a combination of the two main ideas
we've been discussing: spool as many people as possible into high-density storage until we get somewhere with space and mass
and energy to reincarnate them, and get our hands on a router. The entire planetary polity can't afford to pay the energy
budget of a relativistic starship big enough to hold everyone, even as uploads, and a subrelativistic ship would be too damn
vulnerable to the Vile Offspring. And it follows that, instead of taking potluck on the destination, we should learn about the
network protocols the routers use, figure out some kind of transferable currency we can use to pay for our reinstantiation
at the other end, and also how to make some kind of map so we know where we're going. The two hard parts are getting at
or to a router, and paying – that's going to mean traveling with someone who understands Economics 2.0 but doesn't want
to hang around the Vile Offspring.
"As it happens, these old acquaintances of mine went out and fetched back a router seed, for their own purposes. It's sitting
about thirty light-hours away from here, out in the Kuiper belt. They're trying to hatch it right now. And I think Aineko
might be willing to go with us and handle the trade negotiations." He raises the palm of his right hand and flips a bundle of
tags into the shared spatial cache of the inner circle's memories.
Lobsters. Decades ago, back in the dim wastelands of the depression-ridden naughty oughties, the uploaded lobsters had
escaped. Manfred brokered a deal for them to get their very own cometary factory colony. Years later, Amber's expedition
to the router had run into eerie zombie lobsters, upload images that had been taken over and reanimated by the Wunch.
But where the real lobsters had gotten to ...
For a moment, Rita sees herself hovering in darkness and vacuum, the distant siren song of a planetary gravity well far below.
Off to her – left? north? – glows a hazy dim red cloud the size of the full moon as seen from Earth, a cloud that hums with a
constant background noise, the waste heat of a galactic civilization dreaming furious colorless thoughts to itself. Then she
figures out how to slew her unblinking, eyeless viewpoint round and sees the craft.

It's a starship in the shape of a crustacean three kilometers long. It's segmented and flattened, with legs projecting from the
abdominal floor to stretch stiffly sideways and clutch fat balloons of cryogenic deuterium fuel. The blue metallic tail is a
flattened fan wrapped around the delicate stinger of a fusion reactor. Near the head, things are different: no huge claws
there, but the delicately branching fuzz of bush robots, nanoassemblers poised ready to repair damage in flight and spin the
parachute of a ramscoop when the ship is ready to decelerate. The head is massively armored against the blitzkrieg onslaught
of interstellar dust, its radar eyes a glint of hexagonal compound surfaces staring straight at her.
Behind and below the lobster-ship, a planetary ring looms vast and tenuous. The lobster is in orbit around Saturn, mere
light-seconds away. And as Rita stares at the ship in dumbstruck silence, it winks at her.
"They don't have names, at least not as individual identifiers," Manfred says apologetically, "so I asked if he'd mind being called
something. He said Blue, because he is. So I give you the good lobster Something Blue."
Sirhan interrupts, "You still need my cladistics project," he sounds somewhat smug, "to find your way through the network.
Do you have a specific destination in mind?"
"Yeah, to both questions," Manfred admits. "We need to send duplicate ghosts out to each possible router end point, wait
for an echo, then iterate and repeat. Recursive depth-first traversal. The goal – that's harder." He points at the ceiling, which
dissolves into a chaotic 3-D spiderweb that Rita recognizes, after some hours of subjective head-down archive time, as a map
of the dark matter distribution throughout a radius of a billion light-years, galaxies glued like fluff to the nodes where strands
of drying silk meet. "We've known for most of a century that there's something flaky going on out there, out past the Böotes
void – there are a couple of galactic superclusters, around which there's something flaky about the cosmic background
anisotropy. Most computational processes generate entropy as a by-product, and it looks like something is dumping waste
heat into the area from all the galaxies in the region, very evenly spread in a way that mirrors the metal distribution in those
galaxies, except at the very cores. And according to the lobsters, who have been indulging in some very long baseline
interferometry, most of the stars in the nearest cluster are redder than expected and metal-depleted. As if someone's been
mining them."
"Ah." Sirhan stares at his grandfather. "Why should they be any different from the local nodes?"
"Look around you. Do you see any indications of large-scale cosmic engineering within a million light-years of here?" Manfred
shrugs. "Locally, nothing has quite reached ... well. We can guess at the life cycle of a post spike civilization now, can't we?
We've felt the elephant. We've seen the wreckage of collapsed Matrioshka minds. We know how unattractive exploration is
to postsingularity intelligences, we've seen the bandwidth gap that keeps them at home." He points at the ceiling. "But over
there something different happened. They're making changes on the scale of an entire galactic supercluster, and they appear
to be coordinated. They did get out and go places, and their descendants may still be out there. It looks like they're doing
something purposeful and coordinated, something vast – a timing channel attack on the virtual machine that's running the
universe, perhaps, or an embedded simulation of an entirely different universe. Up or down, is it turtles all the way, or is
there something out there that's more real than we are? And don't you think it's worth trying to find out?"
"No." Sirhan crosses his arms. "Not particularly. I'm interested in saving people from the Vile Offspring, not taking a huge
gamble on mystery transcendent aliens who may have built a galaxy-sized reality hacking machine a billion years ago. I'll sell
you my services, and even send a ghost along, but if you expect me to bet my entire future on it ..."
It's too much for Rita. Diverting her attention away from the dizzying inner-space vista, she elbows Sirhan in the ribs. He
looks round blankly for a moment, then with gathering anger as he lets his killfile filter slip. "Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must be silent," she hisses. Then, succumbing to a secondary impulse she knows she'll regret later, she drops a
private channel into his public in-tray.
"Nobody's asking you to," Manfred is saying defensively, arms crossed. "I view this as a Manhattan project kind of thing,
pursue all agendas in parallel. If we win the election, we'll have the resources we need to do that. We should all go through
the router, and we will all leave backups aboard Something Blue. Blue is slow, tops out at about a tenth of cee, but
what he can do is get a sufficient quantity of memory diamond the hell out of circumsolar space before the Vile Offspring's
autonomic defenses activate whatever kind of trust exploit they're planning in the next few megaseconds –"
"What do you want?" Sirhan demands angrily over the channel. He's still not looking at her, and not just because he's focusing
on the vision in blue that dominates the shared space of the team meeting.
"Stop lying to yourself," Rita sends back. "You're lying about your own goals and motivations. You may not want to know the truth your
own ghost worked out, but I do. And I'm not going to let you deny it happened."
"So one of your agents seduced a personality image of me –"
"Bullshit –"
"Do you mean to declare this platform openly?" asks the young-old guy near the platform, the Europol. "Because if so, you're
going to undermine Amber's campaign –"
"That's all right," Amber says tiredly, "I'm used to Dad supporting me in his own inimitable way."
"Is okay," says a new voice. "I are happy wait-state grazing in ecliptic." It's the friendly lobster lifeboat, light-lagged by its
trajectory outside the ring system.

"– You're happy to hide behind a hypocritical sense of moral purity when it makes you feel you can look down on other people, but
underneath it you're just like everyone else –"
"– She set you up to corrupt me, didn't she? You're just bait in her scheme –"
"The idea was to store incremental backups in the Panuliran's cargo cache in case a weakly godlike agency from the inner
system attempts to activate the antibodies they've already disseminated throughout the festival culture," Annette explains,
stepping in on Manfred's behalf.
Nobody else in the discussion space seems to notice that Rita and Sirhan are busy ripping the shit out of each other over a
private channel, throwing emotional hand grenades back and forth like seasoned divorcees. "It's not a satisfactory solution to
the evacuation question, but it ought to satisfy the conservatives' baseline requirement, and as insurance –"
"– That's right, blame your eigenmother! Has it occurred to you that she doesn't care enough about you to try a stunt like that? I think
you spent too much time with that crazy grandmother of yours. You didn't even integrate that ghost, did you? Too afraid of polluting
yourself! I bet you never even bothered to check what it felt like from inside –"
"– I did –" Sirhan freezes for a moment, personality modules paging in and out of his brain like a swarm of angry bees –
"make a fool of myself," he adds quietly, then slumps back in his seat. "This is so embarrassing ..." He covers his face with his
hands. "You're right."
"I am?" Rita's puzzlement slowly gives way to understanding; Sirhan has finally integrated the memories from the partials they
hybridized earlier. Stuck-up and proud, the cognitive dissonance must be enormous. "No, I'm not. You're just overly defensive."
"I'm –" Embarrassed. Because Rita knows him, inside out. Has the ghost-memories of six months in a simspace with him,
playing with ideas, exchanging intimacies, later confidences. She holds ghost-memories of his embrace, a smoky affair that
might have happened in real space if his instant reaction to realizing that it could happen hadn't been to dump the splinter of
his mind that was contaminated by impure thoughts to cold storage and deny everything.
"We have no threat profile yet," Annette says, cutting right across their private conversation. "If there is a direct threat –
and we don't know that for sure, yet, the Vile Offspring might be enlightened enough simply to be leaving us alone – it'll
probably be some kind of subtle attack aimed directly at the foundations of our identity. Look for a credit bubble,
distributed trust metrics devaluing suddenly as people catch some kind of weird religion, something like that. Maybe a
perverse election outcome. And it won't be sudden. They are not stupid, to start a headlong attack without slow corruption
to soften the way."
"You've obviously been thinking about this for some time," Sameena says with dry emphasis. "What's in it for your friend, uh,
Blue? Did you squirrel away enough credit to cover the price of renting a starship from the Economics 2.0 metabubble? Or
is there something you aren't telling us?"
"Um." Manfred looks like a small boy with his hand caught in the sweets jar. "Well, as a matter of fact –"
"Yes, Dad, why don't you tell us just what this is going to cost?" Amber asks.
"Ah, well." He looks embarrassed. "It's the lobsters, not Aineko. They want some payment."
Rita reaches out and grabs Sirhan's hand: He doesn't resist. "Do you know about this?" Rita queries him.
"All new to me ..." A confused partial thread follows his reply down the pipe, and for a while, she joins him in introspective
reverie, trying to work out the implications of knowing what they know about the possibility of a mutual relationship.
"They want a written conceptual map. A map of all the accessible meme spaces hanging off the router network, compiled by
human explorers who they can use as a baseline, they say. It's quite simple – in return for a ticket out-system, some of us are
going to have to go exploring. But that doesn't mean we can't leave back-ups behind."
"Do they have any particular explorers in mind?" Amber sniffs.
"No," says Manfred. "Just a team of us, to map out the router network and ensure they get some warning of threats from
outside." He pauses. "You're going to want to come along, aren't you?"

The pre-election campaign takes approximately three minutes and consumes more bandwidth than the sum of all terrestrial
communications channels from prehistory to 2008. Approximately six million ghosts of Amber, individually tailored to fit the
profile of the targeted audience, fork across the dark fiber meshwork underpinning of the lily-pad colonies, then out through
ultrawideband mesh networks, instantiated in implants and floating dust motes to buttonhole the voters. Many of them fail to
reach their audience, and many more hold fruitless discussions; about six actually decide they've diverged so far from their
original that they constitute separate people and register for independent citizenship, two defect to the other side, and one
elopes with a swarm of highly empathic modified African honeybees.
Ambers are not the only ghosts competing for attention in the public zeitgeist. In fact, they're in a minority. Most of the
autonomous electoral agents are campaigning for a variety of platforms that range from introducing a progressive income
tax – nobody is quite sure why, but it seems to be traditional – to a motion calling for the entire planet to be paved, which

the Livid Pranksters are demanding equal rights for subsentient entities, and a host of single-issue pressure groups are
yammering about the usual lost causes.
Just how the election process anneals is a black mystery – at least, to those people who aren't party to the workings of the
Festival Committee, the group who first had the idea of paving Saturn with hot-hydrogen balloons – but over the course of
a complete diurn, almost forty thousand seconds, a pattern begins to emerge. This pattern will systematize the bias of the
communications networks that traffic in reputation points across the planetary polity for a long time – possibly as much as
fifty million seconds, getting on for a whole Martian year (if Mars still existed). It will create a parliament – a merged group
mind borganism that speaks as one supermind built from the beliefs of the victors. And the news isn't great, as the party
gathered in the upper sphere of the Atomium (which Manfred insisted Amber rent for the dead dog party) is slowly
realizing. Amber isn't there, presumably drowning her sorrows or engaging in postelection schemes of a different nature
somewhere else. But other members of her team are about.
"It could be worse," Rita rationalizes, late in the evening. She's sitting in a corner of the seventh-floor deck, in a 1950s
wireframe chair, clutching a glass of synthetic single malt and watching the shadows. "We could be in an old-style contested
election with seven shades of shit flying. At least this way we can be decently anonymous."
One of the blind spots detaches from her peripheral vision and approaches. It segues into view, suddenly congealing into
Sirhan. He looks morose.
"What's your problem?" she demands. "Your former faction is winning on the count."
"Maybe so." He sits down beside her, carefully avoiding her gaze. "Maybe this is a good thing. And maybe not."
"So when are you going to join the syncitium?" she asks.
"Me? Join that?" He looks alarmed. "You think I want to become part of a parliamentary borg? What do you take me for?"
"Oh." She shakes her head. "I assumed you were avoiding me because –"
"No." He holds out his hand, and a passing waitron deposits a glass in it. He takes a deep breath. "I owe you an apology."
About time, she thinks, uncharitably. But he's like that. Stiff-necked and proud, slow to acknowledge a mistake, but unlikely to
apologize unless he really means it. "What for?" she asks.
"For not giving you the benefit of the doubt," he says slowly, rolling the glass between his palms. "I should have listened to
myself earlier instead of locking him out of me."
The self he's talking about seems self-evident to her. "You're not an easy man to get close to," she says quietly. "Maybe that's
part of your problem."
"Part of it?" He chuckles bitterly. "My mother –" He bites back whatever he originally meant to say. "Do you know I'm older
than she is? Than this version, I mean. She gets up my nose with her assumptions about me ..."
"They run both ways." Rita reaches out and takes his hand – and he grips her right back, no rejection this time. "Listen, it
looks as if she's not going to make it into the parliament of lies. There's a straight conservative sweep, these folks are in solid
denial. About eighty percent of the population are resimulants or old-timers from Earth, and that's not going to change
before the Vile Offspring turn on us. What are we going to do?"
He shrugs. "I suspect everyone who thinks we're really under threat will move on. You know this is going to destroy the
accelerationistas trust in democracy? They've still got a viable plan – Manfred's friendly lobster will work without the need for
an entire planet's energy budget – but the rejection is going to hurt. I can't help thinking that maybe the real goal of the Vile
Offspring was simply to gerrymander us into not diverting resources away from them. It's blunt, it's unsubtle, so we assumed
that wasn't the point. But maybe there's a time for them to be blunt."
She shrugs. "Democracy is a bad fit for lifeboats." But she's still uncomfortable with the idea. "And think of all the people we'll
be leaving behind."
"Well." He smiles tightly. "If you can think of any way to encourage the masses to join us ..."
"A good start would be to stop thinking of them as masses to be manipulated." Rita stares at him. "Your family appears to
have been developing a hereditary elitist streak, and it's not attractive."
Sirhan looks uncomfortable. "If you think I'm bad, you should talk to Aineko about it," he says, self- deprecatingly. "Sometimes
I wonder about that cat."
"Maybe I will." She pauses. "And you? What are you going to do with yourself? Are you going to join the explorers?"
"I –" He looks sideways at her. "I can see myself sending an eigenbrother," he says quietly. "But I'm not going to gamble my
entire future on a bid to reach the far side of the observable universe by router. I've had enough excitement to last me a
lifetime, lately. I think one copy for the backup archive in the icy depths, one to go exploring – and one to settle down and

raise a family. What about you?"
"You'll go all three ways?" she asks.
"Yes, I think so. What about you?"
"Where you go, I go." She leans against him. "Isn't that what matters in the end?" she murmurs.

Chapter 9: Survivor
This time, more than a double handful of years passes between successive visits to the Macx dynasty.
Somewhere in the gas-sprinkled darkness beyond the local void, carbon-based life stirs. A cylinder of diamond fifty kilometers
long spins in the darkness, its surface etched with strange quantum wells that emulate exotic atoms not found in any periodic
table that Mendeleyev would have recognized. Within it, walls hold kilotonnes of oxygen and nitrogen gas, megatonnes of
life-infested soil. A hundred trillion kilometers from the wreckage of Earth, the cylinder glitters like a gem in the darkness.
Welcome to New Japan: one of the places between the stars where human beings hang out, now that the solar system is
off-limits to meatbodies.
I wonder who we'll find here?
***
There's an open plaza in one of the terraform sectors of the habitat cylinder. A huge gong hangs from a beautifully painted
wooden frame at one side of the square, which is paved with weathered limestone slabs made of atoms ripped from a planet
that has never seen molten ice. Houses stand around, and open-fronted huts where a variety of humanoid waitrons attend
to food and beverages for the passing realfolk. A group of prepubescent children are playing hunt-and-seek with their
big-eyed pet companions, brandishing makeshift spears and automatic rifles – there's no pain here, for bodies are fungible,
rebuilt in a minute by the assembler/disassembler gates in every room. There are few adults hereabouts, for Red Plaza is
unfashionable at present, and the kids have claimed it for their own as a playground. They're all genuinely young, symptoms
of a demographic demiurge, not a single wendypan among them.
A skinny boy with nut brown skin, a mop of black hair, and three arms is patiently stalking a worried-looking blue eeyore
around the corner of the square. He's passing a stand stacked with fresh sushi rolls when the strange beast squirms out from
beneath a wheelbarrow and arches its back, stretching luxuriously.
The boy, Manni, freezes, hands tensing around his spear as he focuses on the new target. (The blue eeyore flicks its tail at him
and darts for safety across a lichen-encrusted slab.) "City, what's that?" he asks without moving his lips.
"What are you looking at?" replies City, which puzzles him somewhat, but not as much as it should.
The beast finishes stretching one front leg and extends another. It looks a bit like a pussycat to Manni, but there's something
subtly wrong with it. Its head is a little too small, the eyes likewise – and those paws – "You're sharp," he accuses the beast,
forehead wrinkling in disapproval.
"Yeah, whatever." The creature yawns, and Manni points his spear at it, clenching the shaft in both right hands. It's got sharp
teeth, too, but it spoke to him via his inner hearing, not his ears. Innerspeech is for people, not toys.
"Who are you?" he demands.
The beast looks at him insolently. "I know your parents," it says, still using innerspeech. "You're Manni Macx, aren't you?
Thought so. I want you to take me to your father."
"No!" Manni jumps up and waves his arms at it. "I don't like you! Go away!" He pokes his spear in the direction of the beast's
nose.
"I'll go away when you take me to your father," says the beast. It raises its tail like a pussycat, and the fur bushes out, but
then it pauses. "If you take me to your father I'll tell you a story afterward, how about that?"
"Don't care!" Manni is only about two hundred megaseconds old – seven old Earth-years – but he can tell when he's being
manipulated and gets truculent.
"Kids." The cat-thing's tail lashes from side to side. "Okay, Manni, how about you take me to your father, or I rip your face
off? I've got claws, you know." A brief eyeblink later, it's wrapping itself around his ankles sinuously, purring to give the lie to
its unreliable threat – but he can see that it's got sharp nails all right. It's a wild pussycat-thing, and nothing in his artificially
preserved orthohuman upbringing has prepared him for dealing with a real wild pussycat-thing that talks.
"Get away!" Manni is worried. "Mom!" he hollers, unintentionally triggering the broadcast flag in his innerspeech. "There's this
thing –"
"Mom will do." The cat-thing sounds resigned. It stops rubbing against Manni's legs and looks up at him. "There's no need to

panic. I won't hurt you."
Manni stops hollering. "Who're you?" he asks at last, staring at the beast. Somewhere light-years away, an adult has heard his
cry; his mother is coming fast, bouncing between switches and glancing off folded dimensions in a headlong rush toward him.
"I'm Aineko." The beast sits down and begins to wash behind one hind leg. "And you're Manni, right?"
"Aineko," Manni says uncertainly. "Do you know Lis or Bill?"
Aineko the cat-thing pauses in his washing routine and looks at Manni, head cocked to one side. Manni is too young, too
inexperienced to know that Aineko's proportions are those of a domestic cat, Felis catus, a naturally evolved animal rather
than the toys and palimpsests and companionables he's used to. Reality may be fashionable with his parents' generation, but
there are limits, after all. Orange-and-brown stripes and whorls decorate Aineko's fur, and he sprouts a white fluffy bib
beneath his chin. "Who are Lis and Bill?"
"Them," says Manni, as big, sullen-faced Bill creeps up behind Aineko and tries to grab his tail while Lis floats behind his
shoulder like a pint-sized UFO, buzzing excitedly. But Aineko is too fast for the kids and scampers round Manni's feet like a
hairy missile. Manni whoops and tries to spear the pussycat-thing, but his spear turns to blue glass, crackles, and shards of
brilliant snow rain down, burning his hands.
"Now that wasn't very friendly, was it?" says Aineko, a menacing note in his voice. "Didn't your mother teach you not to –"
The door in the side of the sushi stall opens as Rita arrives, breathless and angry: "Manni! What have I told you about playing
–"
She stops, seeing Aineko. "You." She recoils in barely concealed fright. Unlike Manni, she recognizes it as the avatar of a
posthuman demiurge, a body incarnated solely to provide a point of personal interaction for people to focus on.
The cat grins back at her. "Me," he agrees. "Ready to talk?"
She looks stricken. "We've got nothing to talk about."
Aineko lashes his tail. "Oh, but we do." The cat turns and looks pointedly at Manni. "Don't we?"
***
It has been a long time since Aineko passed this way, and in the meantime the space around Hyundai
+4904/
-56 has changed out of all recognition. Back when the great lobster-built starships swept out of Sol's
Oort cloud, archiving the raw frozen data of the unoccupied brown dwarf halo systems and seeding their
structured excrement with programmable matter, there was nothing but random dead atoms hereabouts
(and an alien router). But that was a long time ago; and since then, the brown dwarf system has succumbed
to an anthropic infestation.
An unoptimized instance of H. sapiens maintains state coherency for only two to three gigaseconds before it
succumbs to necrosis. But in only about ten gigaseconds, the infestation has turned the dead brown dwarf
system upside down. They strip-mined the chilly planets to make environments suitable for their own variety
of carbon life. They rearranged moons, building massive structures the size of asteroids. They ripped
wormhole endpoints free of the routers and turned them into their own crude point-to-point network,
learned how to generate new wormholes, then ran their own packet-switched polities over them. Wormhole
traffic now supports an ever-expanding mesh of interstellar human commerce, but always in the darkness
between the lit stars and the strange, metal-depleted dwarfs with the suspiciously low-entropy radiation. The
sheer temerity of the project is mind-boggling: notwithstanding that canned apes are simply not suited to life
in the interstellar void, especially in orbit around a brown dwarf whose planets make Pluto seem like a
tropical paradise, they've taken over the whole damn system.
New Japan is one of the newer human polities in this system, a bunch of nodes physically collocated in the
humaniformed spaces of the colony cylinders. Its designers evidently only knew about old Nippon from
recordings made back before Earth was dismantled, and worked from a combination of nostalgia-trip videos,
Miyazaki movies, and anime culture. Nevertheless, it's the home of numerous human beings – even if they are
about as similar to their historical antecedents as New Japan is to its long-gone namesake.
Humanity?
Their grandparents would recognize them, mostly. The ones who are truly beyond the ken of
twentieth-century survivors stayed back home in the red-hot clouds of nanocomputers that have replaced
the planets that once orbited Earth's sun in stately Copernican harmony. The fast-thinking Matrioshka brains
are as incomprehensible to their merely posthuman ancestors as an ICBM to an amoeba – and about as
inhabitable. Space is dusted with the corpses of Matrioshka brains that have long since burned out,
informational collapse taking down entire civilizations that stayed in close orbit around their home stars.
Farther away, galaxy-sized intelligences beat incomprehensible rhythms against the darkness of the vacuum,
trying to hack the Planck substrate into doing their bidding. Posthumans, and the few other semitranscended
species to have discovered the router network, live furtively in the darkness between these islands of

brilliance. There are, it would seem, advantages to not being too intelligent.
Humanity. Monadic intelligences, mostly trapped within their own skulls, living in small family groups within
larger tribal networks, adaptable to territorial or migratory lifestyles. Those were the options on offer before
the great acceleration. Now that dumb matter thinks, with every kilogram of wallpaper potentially hosting
hundreds of uploaded ancestors, now that every door is potentially a wormhole to a hab half a parsec away,
the humans can stay in the same place while the landscape migrates and mutates past them, streaming into
the luxurious void of their personal history. Life is rich here, endlessly varied and sometimes confusing. So it
is that tribal groups remain, their associations mediated across teraklicks and gigaseconds by exotic agencies.
And sometimes the agencies will vanish for a while, reappearing later like an unexpected jape upon the
infinite.

Ancestor worship takes on a whole new meaning when the state vectors of all the filial entities' precursors are archived and
indexed for recall. At just the moment that the tiny capillaries in Rita's face are constricting in response to a surge of
adrenaline, causing her to turn pale and her pupils to dilate as she focuses on the pussycat-thing, Sirhan is kneeling before a
small shrine, lighting a stick of incense, and preparing to respectfully address his grandfather's ghost.
The ritual is, strictly speaking, unnecessary. Sirhan can speak to his grandfather's ghost wherever and whenever he wants,
without any formality, and the ghost will reply at interminable length, cracking puns in dead languages and asking about
people who died before the temple of history was established. But Sirhan is a sucker for rituals, and anyway, it helps him
structure an otherwise-stressful encounter.
If it were up to Sirhan, he'd probably skip chatting to grandfather every ten megaseconds. Sirhan's mother and her partner
aren't available, having opted to join one of the long-distance exploration missions through the router network that were
launched by the accelerationistas long ago; and Rita's antecedents are either fully virtualized or dead. They are a family with a
tenuous grip on history. But both of them spent a long time in the same state of half-life in which Manfred currently exists,
and he knows his wife will take him to task if he doesn't bring the revered ancestor up to date on what's been happening in
the real world while he's been dead. In Manfred's case, death is not only potentially reversible, but almost inevitably so. After
all, they're raising his clone. Sooner or later, the kid is going to want to visit the original, or vice versa.
What a state we have come to, when the restless dead refuse to stay a part of history? He wonders ironically as he scratches the
self-igniter strip on the red incense stick and bows to the mirror at the back of the shrine. "Your respectful grandson awaits
and expects your guidance," he intones formally – for in addition to being conservative by nature, Sirhan is acutely aware of
his family's relative poverty and the need to augment their social credit, and in this reincarnation-intermediated traditionalist
polity for the hopelessly orthohuman, you can score credit for formality. He sits back on his heels to await the response.
Manfred doesn't take long to appear in the depths of the mirror. He takes the shape of an albino orang-utan, as usual: He
was messing around with Great Aunt Annette's ontological wardrobe right before this copy of him was recorded and placed
in the temple - they might have separated, but they remained close. "Hi, lad. What year is it?"
Sirhan suppresses a sigh. "We don't do years anymore," he explains, not for the first time. Every time he consults his
grandfather, the new instance asks this question sooner or later. "Years are an archaism. It's been ten megs since we last
spoke – about four months, if you're going to be pedantic about it, and a hundred and eighty years since we emigrated.
Although correcting for general relativity adds another decade or so."
"Oh. Is that all?" Manfred manages to look disappointed. This is a new one on Sirhan: Usually the diverging state vector of
Gramps's ghost asks after Amber or cracks a feeble joke at this point. "No changes in the Hubble constant, or the rate of
stellar formation? Have we heard from any of the exploration eigenselves yet?"
"Nope." Sirhan relaxes slightly. So Manfred is going to ask about the fool's errand to the edge of the Beckenstein limit again,
is he? That's canned conversation number twenty-nine. (Amber and the other explorers who set out for the really long
exploration mission shortly after the first colony was settled aren't due back for, oh, about 1019 seconds. It's a long way to
the edge of the observable universe, even when you can go the first several hundred million light-years – to the Böotes
supercluster and beyond – via a small-world network of wormholes. And this time, she didn't leave any copies of herself
behind.)
Sirhan – either in this or some other incarnation – has had this talk with Manfred many times before, because that's the
essence of the dead. They don't remember from one recall session to the next, unless and until they ask to be resurrected
because their restoration criteria have been matched. Manfred has been dead a long time, long enough for Sirhan and Rita
to be resurrected and live a long family life three or four times over after they had spent a century or so in nonexistence.
"We've received no notices from the lobsters, nothing from Aineko either." He takes a deep breath. "You always ask me
where we are next, so I've got a canned response for you –" and one of his agents throws the package, tagged as a scroll
sealed with red wax and a silk ribbon, through the surface of the mirror. (After the tenth repetition Rita and Sirhan agreed
to write a basic briefing that the Manfred-ghosts could use to orient themselves.)
Manfred is silent for a moment – probably hours in ghost-space – as he assimilates the changes. Then: "This is true? I've slept
through a whole civilization?"
"Not slept, you've been dead," Sirhan says pedantically. He realizes he's being a bit harsh: "Actually, so did we," he adds. "We
surfed the first three gigasecs or so because we wanted to start a family somewhere where our children could grow up the

traditional way. Habs with an oxidation-intensive triple-point water environment didn't get built until sometime after the
beginning of the exile. That's when the fad for neomorphism got entrenched," he adds with distaste. For quite a while the
neos resisted the idea of wasting resources building colony cylinders spinning to provide vertebrate-friendly gee forces and
breathable oxygen-rich atmospheres – it had been quite a political football. But the increasing curve of wealth production
had allowed the orthodox to reincarnate from death-sleep after a few decades, once the fundamental headaches of building
settlements in chilly orbits around metal-deficient brown dwarfs were overcome.
"Uh." Manfred takes a deep breath, then scratches himself under one armpit, rubbery lips puckering. "So, let me get this
straight: We – you, they, whoever – hit the router at Hyundai +4904/ -56, replicated a load of them, and now use the
wormhole mechanism the routers rely on as point-to-point gates for physical transport? And have spread throughout a
bunch of brown dwarf systems, and built a pure deep-space polity based on big cylinder habitats connected by teleport gates
hacked out of routers?"
"Would you trust one of the original routers for switched data communications?" Sirhan asks rhetorically. "Even with the
source code? They've been corrupted by all the dead alien Matrioshka civilizations they've come into contact with, but
they're reasonably safe if all you want to use them for is to cannibalize them for wormholes and tunnel dumb mass from
point to point." He searches for a metaphor: "Like using your, uh, internet, to emulate a nineteenth-century postal service."
"O-kay." Manfred looks thoughtful, as he usually does at this point in the conversation – which means Sirhan is going to have
to break it to him that his first thoughts for how to utilize the gates have already been done. They're hopelessly old hat. In
fact, the main reason why Manfred is still dead is that things have moved on so far that, sooner or later, whenever he
surfaces for a chat, he gets frustrated and elects not to be reincarnated. Not that Sirhan is about to tell him that he's
obsolete – that would be rude, not to say subtly inaccurate. "That raises some interesting possibilities. I wonder, has anyone
–"
"Sirhan, I need you!"
The crystal chill of Rita's alarm and fear cuts through Sirhan's awareness like a scalpel, distracting him from the ghost of his
ancestor. He blinks, instantly transferring the full focus of his attention to Rita without sparing Manfred even a ghost.
"What's happening –"
He sees through Rita's eyes: a cat with an orange-and-brown swirl on its flank sits purring beside Manni in the family room of
their dwelling. Its eyes are narrowed as it watches her with unnatural wisdom. Manni is running fingers through its fur and
seems none the worse for wear, but Sirhan still feels his fists clench.
"What –"
"Excuse me," he says, standing up: "Got to go. Your bloody cat's turned up." He adds "coming home now" for Rita's benefit,
then turns and hurries out of the temple concourse. When he reaches the main hall, he pauses, then Rita's sense of urgency
returns to him, and he throws parsimony to the wind, stepping into a priority gate in order to get home as fast as possible.
Behind him, Manfred's melancholy ghost snorts, mildly offended, and considers the existential choice: to be, or not to be.
Then he makes a decision.
***
Welcome to the twenty-third century, or the twenty-fourth. Or maybe it's the twenty-second, jet-lagged and
dazed by spurious suspended animation and relativistic travel; it hardly matters these days. What's left of
recognizable humanity has scattered across a hundred light-years, living in hollowed-out asteroids and
cylindrical spinning habitats strung in orbit around cold brown dwarf stars and sunless planets that wander
the interstellar void. The looted mechanisms underlying the alien routers have been cannibalized, simplified
to a level the merely superhuman can almost comprehend, turned into generators for paired wormhole
endpoints that allow instantaneous switched transport across vast distances. Other mechanisms, the
descendants of the advanced nanotechnologies developed by the flowering of human techgnosis in the
twenty-first century, have made the replication of dumb matter trivial; this is not a society accustomed to
scarcity.
But in some respects, New Japan and the Invisible Empire and the other polities of human space are
poverty-stricken backwaters. They take no part in the higher-order economies of the posthuman. They can
barely comprehend the idle muttering of the Vile Offspring, whose mass/energy budget (derived from their
complete restructuring of the free matter of humanity's original solar system into computronium) dwarfs that
of half a hundred human-occupied brown dwarf systems. And they still know worryingly little about the deep
history of intelligence in this universe, about the origins of the router network that laces so many dead
civilizations into an embrace of death and decay, about the distant galaxy-scale bursts of information
processing that lie at measurable red-shift distances, even about the free posthumans who live among them in
some senses, collocated in the same light cone as these living fossil relics of old-fashioned humanity.
Sirhan and Rita settled in this charming human-friendly backwater in order to raise a family, study
xenoarchaeology, and avoid the turmoil and turbulence that have characterized his family's history across
the last couple of generations. Life has been comfortable for the most part, and if the stipend of an academic
nucleofamilial is not large, it is sufficient in this place and age to provide all the necessary comforts of

civilization. And this suits Sirhan (and Rita) fine; the turbulent lives of their entrepreneurial ancestors led to
grief and angst and adventures, and as Sirhan is fond of observing, an adventure is something horrible that
happens to someone else.
Only ...
Aineko is back. Aineko, who after negotiating the establishment of the earliest of the refugee habs in orbit
around Hyundai +4904/ -56, vanished into the router network with Manfred's other instance – and the partial
copies of Sirhan and Rita who had forked, seeking adventure rather than cozy domesticity. Sirhan made a
devil's bargain with Aineko, all those gigaseconds ago, and now he is deathly afraid that Aineko is going to call
the payment due.
***

Manfred walks down a hall of mirrors. At the far end, he emerges in a public space modeled on a Menger sponge – a cube
diced subtractively into ever-smaller cubic volumes until its surface area tends toward infinity. This being meatspace, or a
reasonable simulation thereof, it isn't a real Menger sponge; but it looks good at a distance, going down at least four levels.
He pauses behind a waist-high diamond barrier and looks down into the almost-tesseract-shaped depths of the cube's
interior, at a verdant garden landscape with charming footbridges that cross streams laid out with careful attention to the
requirements of feng shui. He looks up: Some of the cube-shaped subtractive openings within the pseudofractal structure are
occupied by windows belonging to dwellings or shared buildings that overlook the public space. High above, butterfly-shaped
beings with exotic colored wings circle in the ventilation currents. It's hard to tell from down here, but the central cuboid
opening looks to be at least half a kilometer on a side, and they might very well be posthumans with low-gee wings – angels.
Angels, or rats in the walls? he asks himself, and sighs. Half his extensions are off-line, so hopelessly obsolete that the temple's
assembler systems didn't bother replicating them, or even creating emulation environments for them to run in. The rest ...
well, at least he's still physically orthohuman, he realizes. Fully functional, fully male. Not everything has changed – only the
important stuff. It's a scary-funny thought, laden with irony. Here he is, naked as the day he was born – newly re-created, in
fact, released from the wake-experience-reset cycle of the temple of history – standing on the threshold of a posthuman
civilization so outrageously rich and powerful that they can build mammal-friendly habitats that resemble works of art in the
cryogenic depths of space. Only he's poor, this whole polity is poor, and it can't ever be anything else, in fact, because it's a
dumping ground for merely posthuman also-rans, the singularitarian equivalent of australopithecines. In the brave new world
of the Vile Offspring, they can't get ahead any more than a protohominid could hack it as a rocket scientist in Werner von
Braun's day. They're born to be primitive, wallowing happily in the mud-bath of their own limited cognitive bandwidth. So
they fled into the darkness and built a civilization so bright it can put anything earthbound that came before the singularity
into the shade ... and it's still a shanty town inhabited by the mentally handicapped.
The incongruity of it amuses him, but only for a moment. He has, after all, electively reincarnated for a reason: Sirhan's
throwaway comment about the cat caught his attention. "City, where can I find some clothes?" he asks. "Something socially
appropriate, that is. And some, uh, brains. I need to be able to off-load ..."
Citymind chuckles inside the back of his head, and Manfred realizes that there's a public assembler on the other side of the
ornamental wall he's leaning on. "Oh," he mutters, as he finds himself imagining something not unlike his clunky old direct
neural interface, candy-colored icons and overlays and all. It's curiously mutable, and with a weird sense of detachment, he
realizes that it's not his imagination at all, but an infinitely customizable interface to the pervasive information spaces of the
polity, currently running in dumbed-down stupid mode for his benefit. It's true; he needs training wheels. But it doesn't take
him long to figure out how to ask the assembler to make him a pair of pants and a plain black vest, and to discover that, as
long as he keeps his requests simple, the results are free – just like back home on Saturn. The spaceborn polities are kind to
indigents, for the basic requirements of life are cheap, and to withhold them would be tantamount to homicide. (If the
presence of transhumans has upset a whole raft of prior assumptions, at least it hasn't done more than superficial damage to
the Golden Rule.)
Clothed and more or less conscious – at least at a human level – Manfred takes stock. "Where do Sirhan and Rita live?" he
asks. A dotted route makes itself apparent to him, snaking improbably through a solid wall that he understands to be an
instantaneous wormhole gate connecting points light-years apart. He shakes his head, bemused. I suppose I'd better go and see
them, he decides. It's not as if there's anyone else for him to look up, is it? The Franklins vanished into the solar Matrioshka
brain, Pamela died ages ago (and there's a shame, he'd never expected to miss her) and Annette hooked up with Gianni
while he was being a flock of pigeons. (Draw a line under that one and say it's all over.) His daughter vanished into the
long-range exploration program. He's been dead for so long that his friends and acquaintances are scattered across a light
cone centuries across. He can't think of anyone else here who he might run into, except for the loyal grandson, keeping the
candle of filial piety burning with unasked-for zeal. "Maybe he needs help," Manfred thinks aloud as he steps into the gate,
rationalizing. "And then again, maybe he can help me figure out what to do?"

Sirhan gets home, anticipating trouble. He finds it, but not in any way he'd expected. Home is a split-level manifold, rooms
connected by T-gates scattered across a variety of habitats: low-gee sleeping den, high-gee exercise room, and everything in
between. It's furnished simply, tatami mats and programmable matter walls able to extrude any desired furniture in short
order. The walls are configured to look and feel like paper, but can damp out even infant tantrums. But right now, the
antisound isn't working, and the house he comes home to is overrun by shrieking yard apes, a blur of ginger-and-white fur,

and a distraught Rita trying to explain to her neighbor Eloise why her orthodaughter Sam is bouncing around the place like
a crazy ball.
" – The cat, he gets them worked up." She wrings her hands and begins to turn as Sirhan comes into view. "At last!"
"I came fast." He nods respectfully at Eloise, then frowns. "The children –" Something small and fast runs headfirst into him,
grabs his legs, and tries to head-butt him in the crotch. "Oof!" He bends down and lifts Manni up. "Hey, son, haven't I told
you not to –"
"Not his fault," Rita says hurriedly. "He's excited because –"
"I really don't think –" Eloise begins to gather steam, looking around uncertainly.
"Mrreeow?" something asks in a conversational tone of voice from down around Sirhan's ankles.
"Eek!" Sirhan jumps backward, flailing for balance under the weight of an excited toddler. There's a gigantic disturbance in
the polity thoughtspace – like a stellar-mass black hole – and it appears to be stropping itself furrily against his left leg. "What
are you doing here?" He demands.
"Oh, this and that," says the cat, his innerspeech accent a sardonic drawl. "I thought it was about time I visited again. Where's
your household assembler? Mind if I use it? Got a little something I need to make up for a friend ..."
"What?" Rita demands, instantly suspicious. "Haven't you caused enough trouble already?" Sirhan looks at her approvingly;
obviously Amber's long-ago warnings about the cat sank in deeply, because she's certainly not treating it as the small bundle
of child-friendly fun it would like to be perceived as.
"Trouble?" The cat looks up at her sardonically, lashing his tail from side to side. "I won't make any trouble, I promise you.
It's just –"
The door chime clears its throat, to announce a visitor: "Ren Fuller would like to visit, m'lord and lady."
"What's she doing here?" Rita asks irritably. Sirhan can feel her unease, the tenuous grasping of her ghosts as she searches for
reason in an unreasonable world, simulating outcomes, living through bad dreams, and backtracking to adjust her responses
accordingly. "Show her in, by all means." Ren is one of their neighbor-cognates (most of her dwelling is several light-years
away, but in terms of transit time, it's a hop, skip, and a jump); she and her extruded family are raising a small herd of
ill-behaved kids who occasionally hang out with Manni.
A small blue eeyore whinnies mournfully and dashes past the adults, pursued by a couple of children waving spears and
shrieking. Eloise makes a grab for her own and misses, just as the door to the exercise room disappears and Manni's little
friend Lis darts inside like a pint-sized guided missile. "Sam, come here right now –" Eloise calls, heading toward the door.
"Look, what do you want?" Sirhan demands, hugging his son and looking down at the cat.
"Oh, not much," Aineko says, turning to lick a mussed patch of fur on his flank. "I just want to play with him."
"You want to –" Rita stops.
"Daddy!" Manni wants down.
Sirhan lowers him carefully, as if his bones are glass. "Run along and play," he suggests. Turning to Rita: "Why don't you go
and find out what Ren wants, dear?" he asks. "She's probably here to collect Lis, but you can never be sure."
"I was just leaving," Eloise adds, "as soon as I can catch up with Sam." She glances over her shoulder at Rita apologetically,
then dives into the exercise room.
Sirhan takes a step toward the hallway. "Let's talk," he says tightly. "In my study." He glares at the cat. "I want an explanation.
I want to know the truth."
***
Meanwhile, in a cognitive wonderland his parents know about but deeply underestimate, parts of Manni are engaging in
activities far less innocent than they imagine.
Back in the twenty-first century, Sirhan lived through loads of alternate childhoods in simulation, his parents' fingers pressing
firmly on the fast-forward button until they came up with someone who seemed to match their preconceptions. The
experience scarred him as badly as any nineteenth-century boarding school experience, until he promised himself no child
he raised would be subjected to such; but there's a difference between being shoved through a multiplicity of avatars, and
voluntarily diving into an exciting universe of myth and magic where your childhood fantasies take fleshy form, stalking those
of your friends and enemies through the forests of the night.
Manni has grown up with neural interfaces to City's mindspace an order of magnitude more complex than those of Sirhan's
youth, and parts of him – ghosts derived from a starting image of his neural state vector, fertilized with a scattering
borrowed from the original Manfred, simulated on a meat machine far faster than real time – are fully adult. Of course, they

can't fit inside his seven-year-old skull, but they still watch over him. And when he's in danger, they try to take care of their
once and future body.
Manni's primary adult ghost lives in some of New Japan's virtual mindspaces (which are a few billion times more extensive
than the physical spaces available to stubborn biologicals, for the computational density of human habitats have long since
ceased to make much sense when measured in MIPS per kilogram). They're modeled on presingularity Earth. Time is forever
frozen on the eve of the real twenty-first century, zero eight-forty-six hours on September 11: An onrushing wide-body
airliner hangs motionless in the air forty meters below the picture window of Manni's penthouse apartment on the one
hundred and eighth floor of the North Tower. In historical reality, the one hundred and eighth floor was occupied by
corporate offices; but the mindspace is a consensual fiction, and it is Manni's conceit to live at this pivotal point. (Not that it
means much to him – he was born well over a century after the War on Terror – but it's part of his childhood folklore, the
fall of the Two Towers that shattered the myth of Western exceptionalism and paved the way for the world he was born
into.)
Adult-Manni wears an avatar roughly modeled on his clone-father Manfred – skinnier, pegged at a youthful twentysomething,
black-clad, and gothic. He's taking time out from a game of Matrix to listen to music, Type O Negative blaring over the
sound system as he twitches in the grip of an ice-cold coke high. He's expecting a visit from a couple of call girls – themselves
the gamespace avatars of force-grown adult ghosts whose primaries may not be adult, or female, or even human – which is
why he's flopped bonelessly back in his Arne Jacobsen recliner, waiting for something to happen.
The door opens behind him. He doesn't show any sign of noticing the intrusion, although his pupils dilate slightly at the faint
reflection of a woman, stalking toward him, glimpsed dimly in the window glass. "You're late," he says tonelessly. "You were
supposed to be here ten minutes ago –" He begins to look round, and now his eyes widen.
"Who were you expecting?" asks the ice blond in the black business suit, long-skirted and uptight. There's something
predatory about her expression: "No, don't tell me. So you're Manni, eh? Manni's partial?" She sniffs, disapproval. "Fin de
siècle decadence. I'm sure Sirhan wouldn't approve."
"My father can go fuck himself," Manni says truculently. "Who the hell are you?"
The blond snaps her fingers: An office chair appears on the carpet between Manni and the window, and she sits on the edge
of it, smoothing her skirt obsessively. "I'm Pamela," she says tightly. "Has your father told you about me?"
Manni looks puzzled. In the back of his mind, raw instincts alien to anyone instantiated before the midpoint of the
twenty-first century tug on the fabric of pseudoreality. "You're dead, aren't you?" he asks. "One of my ancestors."
"I'm as dead as you are." She gives him a wintry smile. "Nobody stays dead these days, least of all people who know Aineko."
Manni blinks. Now he's beginning to feel a surge of mild irritation. "This is all very well, but I was expecting company," he says
with heavy emphasis. "Not a family reunion, or a tiresome attempt to preach your puritanism –"
Pamela snorts. "Wallow in your pigsty for all I care, kid, I've got more important things to worry about. Have you looked at
your primary recently?"
"My primary?" Manni tenses. "He's doing okay." For a moment his eyes focus on infinity, a thousand-yard stare as he loads
and replays the latest brain dump from his infant self. "Who's the cat he's playing with? That's no companion!"
"Aineko. I told you." Pamela taps the arm of her chair impatiently. "The family curse has come for another generation. And if
you don't do something about it –"
"About what?" Manni sits up. "What are you talking about?" He comes to his feet and turns toward her. Outside the window,
the sky is growing dark with an echo of his own foreboding. Pamela is on her feet before him, the chair evaporated in a puff
of continuity clipping, her expression a cold-eyed challenge.
"I think you know exactly what I'm talking about, Manni. It's time to stop playing this fucking game. Grow up, while you've still
got the chance!"
"I'm –" He stops. "Who am I?" he asks, a chill wind of uncertainty drying the sweat that has sprung up and down his spine.
"And what are you doing here?"
"Do you really want to know the answer? I'm dead, remember. The dead know everything. And that isn't necessarily good
for the living ..."
He takes a deep breath. "Am I dead too?" He looks puzzled. "There's an adult-me in Seventh Cube Heaven, what's he doing
here?"
"It's the kind of coincidence that isn't." She reaches out and takes his hand, dumping encrypted tokens deep into his
sensorium, a trail of bread crumbs leading into a dark and trackless part of mindspace. "Want to find out? Follow me." Then
she vanishes.
Manni leans forward, baffled and frightened, staring down at the frozen majesty of the onrushing airliner below his window.
"Shit," he whispers. She came right through my defenses without leaving a trace. Who is she? The ghost of his dead
great-grandmother, or something else?

I'll have to follow her if I want to find out, he realizes. He holds up his left hand, stares at the invisible token glowing brightly
inside his husk of flesh. "Resynchronize me with my primary," he says.
A fraction of a second later, the floor of the penthouse bucks and quakes wildly and fire alarms begin to shriek as time comes
to an end and the frozen airliner completes its journey. But Manni isn't there anymore. And if a skyscraper falls in a
simulation with nobody to see it, has anything actually happened?
***
"I've come for the boy," says the cat. It sits on the hand woven rug in the middle of the hardwood floor with one hind leg
sticking out at an odd angle, as if it's forgotten about it. Sirhan teeters on the edge of hysteria for a moment as he
apprehends the sheer size of the entity before him, the whimsical posthuman creation of his ancestors. Originally a robotic
toy companion, Aineko was progressively upgraded and patched. By the eighties, when Sirhan first met the cat in the flesh,
he was already a terrifyingly alien intelligence, subtle and ironic. And now ...
Sirhan knows Aineko manipulated his eigenmother, bending her natural affections away from his real father and toward
another man. In moments of black introspection, he sometimes wonders if the cat wasn't also responsible in some way for his
own broken upbringing, the failure to relate to his real parents. After all, it was a pawn in the vicious divorce battle between
Manfred and Pamela – decades before his birth – and there might be long-term instructions buried in its preconscious
drives. What if the pawn is actually a hidden king, scheming in the darkness?
"I've come for Manny."
"You're not having him." Sirhan maintains an outer facade of calm, even though his first inclination is to snap at Aineko.
"Haven't you done enough damage already?"
"You're not going to make this easy, are you?" The cat stretches his head forward and begins to lick obsessively between the
splayed toes of his raised foot. "I'm not making a demand, kid, I said I've come for him, and you're not really in the frame at
all. In fact, I'm going out of my way to warn you."
"And I say –" Sirhan stops. "Shit!" Sirhan doesn't approve of swearing: The curse is an outward demonstration of his inner
turmoil. "Forget what I was about to say, I'm sure you already know it. Let me begin again, please."
"Sure. Let's play this your way." The cat chews on a loose nail sheath but his innerspeech is perfectly clear, a casual intimacy
that keeps Sirhan on edge. "You've got some idea of what I am, clearly. You know – I ascribe intentionality to you – that my
theory of mind is intrinsically stronger than yours, that my cognitive model of human consciousness is complete. You might
well suspect that I use a Turing Oracle to think my way around your halting states." The cat isn't worrying at a loose claw
now, he's grinning, pointy teeth gleaming in the light from Sirhan's study window. The window looks out onto the inner
space of the habitat cylinder, up at a sky with hillsides and lakes and forests plastered across it: It's like an Escher landscape,
modeled with complete perfection. "You've realized that I can think my way around the outside of your box while you're
flailing away inside it, and I'm always one jump ahead of you. What else do you know I know?"
Sirhan shivers. Aineko is staring up at him, unblinking. For a moment, he feels at gut level that he is in the presence of an
alien god: It's the simple truth, isn't it? But – "Okay, I concede the point," Sirhan says after a moment in which he spawns a
blizzard of panicky cognitive ghosts, fractional personalities each tasked with the examination of a different facet of the same
problem. "You're smarter than I am. I'm just a boringly augmented human being, but you've got a flashy new theory of mind
that lets you work around creatures like me the way I can think my way around a real cat." He crosses his arms defensively.
"You do not normally rub this in. It's not in your interests to do so, is it? You prefer to hide your manipulative capabilities
under an affable exterior, to play with us. So you're revealing all this for a reason." There's a note of bitterness in his voice
now. Glancing round, Sirhan summons up a chair – and, as an afterthought, a cat basket. "Have a seat. Why now, Aineko?
What makes you think you can take my eigenson?"
"I didn't say I was going to take him, I said I'd come for him." Aineko's tail lashes from side to side in agitation. "I don't deal in
primate politics, Sirhan: I'm not a monkey-boy. But I knew you'd react badly because the way your species socializes" – a
dozen metaghosts reconverge in Sirhan's mind, drowning Aineko's voice in an inner cacophony – "would enter into the
situation, and it seemed preferable to trigger your territorial/reproductive threat display early, rather than risk it exploding
in my face during a more delicate situation."
Sirhan waves a hand vaguely at the cat: "Please wait." He's trying to integrate his false memories – the output from the
ghosts, their thinking finished – and his eyes narrow suspiciously. "It must be bad. You don't normally get confrontational –
you script your interactions with humans ahead of time, so that you maneuver them into doing what you want them to do
and thinking it was their idea all along." He tenses. "What is it about Manni that brought you here? What do you want with
him? He's just a kid."
"You're confusing Manni with Manfred." Aineko sends a glyph of a smile to Sirhan: "That's your first mistake, even though
they're clones in different subjective states. Think what he's like when he's grown up."
"But he isn't grown-up!" Sirhan complains. "He hasn't been grown-up for –"
"– Years, Sirhan. That's the problem. I need to talk to your grandfather, really, not your son, and not the goddamn stateless
ghost in the temple of history, I need a Manfred with a sense of continuity. He's got something that I need, and I promise you
I'm not going away until I get it. Do you understand?"

"Yes." Sirhan wonders if his voice sounds as hollow as the feeling in his chest. "But he's our kid, Aineko. We're human. You
know what that means to us?"
"Second childhood." Aineko stands up, stretches, then curls up in the cat basket. "That's the trouble with hacking you naked
apes for long life, you keep needing a flush and reset job – and then you lose continuity. That's not my problem, Sirhan. I
got a signal from the far edge of the router network, a ghost that claims to be family. Says they finally made it out to the big
beyond, out past the Böotes supercluster, found something concrete and important that's worth my while to visit. But I want
to make sure it's not like the Wunch before I answer. I'm not letting that into my mind, even with a sandbox. Do you
understand that? I need to instantiate a real-live adult Manfred with all his memories, one who hasn't been a part of me, and
get him to vouch for the sapient data packet. It takes a conscious being to authenticate that kind of messenger.
Unfortunately, the history temple is annoyingly resistant to unauthorized extraction – I can't just go in and steal a copy of
him – and I don't want to use my own model of Manfred: It knows too much. So –"
"What's it promising?" Sirhan asks tensely.
Aineko looks at him through slitted eyes, a purring buzz at the base of his throat: "Everything."
***
"There are different kinds of death," the woman called Pamela tells Manni, her bone-dry voice a whisper in the darkness.
Manni tries to move, but he seems to be trapped in a confined space; for a moment, he begins to panic, but then he works it
out. "First and most importantly, death is just the absence of life – oh, and for human beings, the absence of consciousness,
too, but not just the absence of consciousness, the absence of the capacity for consciousness." The darkness is close and
disorienting and Manni isn't sure which way up he is – nothing seems to work. Even Pamela's voice is a directionless
ambiance, coming from all around him.
"Simple old-fashioned death, the kind that predated the singularity, used to be the inevitable halting state for all life-forms.
Fairy tales about afterlives notwithstanding." A dry chuckle: "I used to try to believe a different one before breakfast every
day, you know, just in case Pascal's wager was right – exploring the phase-space of all possible resurrections, you know? But I
think at this point we can agree that Dawkins was right. Human consciousness is vulnerable to certain types of transmissible
memetic virus, and religions that promise life beyond death are a particularly pernicious example because they exploit our
natural aversion to halting states."
Manni tries to say, I'm not dead, but his throat doesn't seem to be working. And now that he thinks about it, he doesn't seem
to be breathing, either.
"Now, consciousness. That's a fun thing, isn't it? Product of an arms race between predators and prey. If you watch a cat
creeping up on a mouse, you'll be able to impute to the cat intentions that are most easily explained by the cat having a
theory of mind concerning the mouse – an internal simulation of the mouse's likely behavior when it notices the predator.
Which way to run, for example. And the cat will use its theory of mind to optimize its attack strategy. Meanwhile, prey
species that are complex enough to have a theory of mind are at a defensive advantage if they can anticipate a predator's
actions. Eventually this very mammalian arms race gave us a species of social ape that used its theory of mind to facilitate
signaling – so the tribe could work collectively – and then reflexively, to simulate the individual's own inner states. Put the
two things together, signaling and introspective simulation, and you've got human-level consciousness, with language thrown
in as a bonus – signaling that transmits information about internal states, not just crude signals such as 'predator here' or
'food there.'"
Get me out of this! Manny feels panic biting into him with liquid-helium-lubricated teeth. "G-e-t –" For a miracle the words
actually come out, although he can't tell quite how he's uttering them, his throat being quite as frozen as his innerspeech.
Everything's off-lined, all systems down.
"So," Pamela continues remorselessly, "we come to the posthuman. Not just our own neural wetware, mapped out to the
subcellular level and executed in an emulation environment on a honking great big computer, like this: That's not
posthuman, that's a travesty. I'm talking about beings who are fundamentally better consciousness engines than us merely
human types, augmented or otherwise. They're not just better at cooperation – witness Economics 2.0 for a classic
demonstration of that – but better at simulation. A posthuman can build an internal model of a human-level intelligence that
is, well, as cognitively strong as the original. You or I may think we know what makes other people tick, but we're quite often
wrong, whereas real posthumans can actually simulate us, inner states and all, and get it right. And this is especially true of a
posthuman that's been given full access to our memory prostheses for a period of years, back before we realized they were
going to transcend on us. Isn't that the case, Manni?"
Manni would be screaming at her right now, if he had a mouth – but instead the panic is giving way to an enormous sense
of déja vu. There's something about Pamela, something ominous that he knows ... he's met her before, he's sure of it. And
while most of his systems are off-line, one of them is very much active: There's a personality ghost flagging its intention of
merging back in with him, and the memory delta it carries is enormous, years and years of divergent experiences to absorb.
He shoves it away with a titanic effort – it's a very insistent ghost – and concentrates on imagining the feel of lips moving on
teeth, a sly tongue obstructing his epiglottis, words forming in his throat – "m-e ..."
"We should have known better than to keep upgrading the cat, Manny. It knows us too well. I may have died in the flesh, but
Aineko remembered me, as hideously accurately as the Vile Offspring remembered the random resimulated. And you can run
away – like this, this second childhood – but you can't hide. Your cat wants you. And there's more." Her voice sends chills
up and down his spine, for without him giving it permission, the ghost has begun to merge its stupendous load of memories

with his neural map, and her voice is freighted with erotic/repulsive significance, the result of conditioning feedback he
subjected himself to a lifetime – lifetimes? – ago: "He's been playing with us, Manny, possibly from before we realized he was
conscious."
"Out –" Manfred stops. He can see again, and move, and feel his mouth. He's himself again, physically back as he was in his late
twenties all those decades ago when he'd lived a peripatetic life in presingularity Europe. He's sitting on the edge of a bed in
a charmingly themed Amsterdam hotel with a recurrent motif of philosophers, wearing jeans and collarless shirt and a vest of
pockets crammed with the detritus of a long-obsolete personal area network, his crazily clunky projection specs sitting on
the bedside table. Pamela stands stiffly in front of the door, watching him. She's not the withered travesty he remembers
seeing on Saturn, a half-blind Fate leaning on the shoulder of his grandson. Nor is she the vengeful Fury of Paris, or the
scheming fundamentalist devil of the Belt. Wearing a sharply tailored suit over a red-and-gold brocade corset, blonde hair
drawn back like fine wire in a tight chignon, she's the focused, driven force of nature he first fell in love with: repression,
domination, his very own strict machine.
"We're dead," she says, then gives voice to a tense half laugh: "We don't have to live through the bad times again if we don't
want to."
"What is this?" he asks, his mouth dry.
"It's the reproductive imperative." She sniffs. "Come on, stand up. Come here."
He stands up obediently, but makes no move toward her. "Whose imperative?"
"Not ours." Her cheek twitches. "You find things out when you're dead. That fucking cat has got a lot of questions to
answer."
"You're telling me that –"
She shrugs. "Can you think of any other explanation for all this?" Then she steps forward and takes his hand. "Division and
recombination. Partitioning of memetic replicators into different groups, then careful cross-fertilization. Aineko wasn't just
breeding a better Macx when he arranged all those odd marriages and divorces and eigenparents and forked uploads –
Aineko is trying to breed our minds." Her fingers are slim and cool in his hand. He feels a momentary revulsion, as of the
grave, and he shudders before he realizes it's his conditioning cutting in. Crudely implanted reflexes that shouldn't still be
active after all this time. "Even our divorce. If –"
"Surely not." Manny remembers that much already. "Aineko wasn't even conscious back then!"
Pamela raises one sharply sculpted eyebrow: "Are you sure?"
"You want an answer," he says.
She breathes deeply, and he feels it on his cheek – it raises the fine hairs on the back of his neck. Then she nods stiffly. "I
want to know how much of our history was scripted by the cat. Back when we thought we were upgrading his firmware,
were we? Or was he letting us think that we were?" A sharp hiss of breath: "The divorce. Was that us? Or were we being
manipulated?"
"Our memories, are they real? Did any of that stuff actually happen to us? Or –"
She's standing about twenty centimeters away from him, and Manfred realizes that he's acutely aware of her presence, of the
smell of her skin, the heave of her bosom as she breathes, the dilation of her pupils. For an endless moment he stares into
her eyes and sees his own reflection – her theory of his mind – staring back. Communication. Strict machine. She steps back a
pace, spike heels clicking, and smiles ironically. "You've got a host body waiting for you, freshly fabbed: Seems Sirhan was
talking to your archived ghost in the temple of history, and it decided to elect for reincarnation. Quite a day for huge
coincidences, isn't it? Why don't you go merge with it – I'll meet you, then we can go and ask Aineko some hard questions."
Manfred takes a deep breath and nods. "I suppose so ..."

Little Manni – a clone off the family tree, which is actually a directed cyclic graph – doesn't understand what all the fuss is
about but he can tell when momma, Rita, is upset. It's something to do with the pussycat-thing, that much he knows, but
Momma doesn't want to tell him: "Go play with your friends, dear," she says distractedly, not even bothering to spawn a
ghost to watch over him.
Manni goes into his room and rummages around in toyspace for a bit, but there's nothing quite as interesting as the cat. The
pussycat-thing smells of adventure, the illicit made explicit. Manni wonders where daddy's taken it. He tries to call

which leaves the toyspace in total disarray, Sendak-things cowering under a big bass drum – Manni gets bored. And because
he's still basically a little kid, and not fully in control of his own metaprogramming, instead of adjusting his outlook so that he
isn't bored anymore, he sneaks out through his bedroom gate (which big-Manni-ghost reprogrammed for him sometime ago
so that it would forward to an underused public A-gate that he'd run a man-in-the-middle hack on, so he could use it as a
proxy teleport server) then down to the underside of Red Plaza, where skinless things gibber and howl at their tormentors,

broken angels are crucified on the pillars that hold up the sky, and gangs of semiferal children act out their psychotic
fantasies on mouthless android replicas of parents and authorities.
Lis is there, and Vipul and Kareen and Morgan. Lis has changed into a warbody, an ominous gray battlebot husk with
protruding spikes and a belt of morningstars that whirl threateningly around her. "Manni! Play war?"
Morgan's got great crushing pincers instead of hands, and Manni is glad he came motie-style, his third arm a bony scythe
from the elbow down. He nods excitedly. "Who's the enemy?"
"Them." Lis precesses and points at a bunch of kids on the far side of a pile of artistically arranged rubble who are gathered
around a gibbet, poking things that glow into the flinching flesh of whatever is incarcerated in the cast-iron cage. It's all
make-believe, but the screams are convincing, all the same, and they take Manni back for an instant to the last time he died
down here, the uneasy edit around a black hole of pain surrounding his disemboweling. "They've got Lucy, and they're
torturing her, we've got to get her back." Nobody really dies in these games, not permanently, but children can be very
rough indeed, and the adults of New Japan have found that it's best to let them have at each other and rely on City to
redact the damage later. Allowing them this outlet makes it easier to stop them doing really dangerous things that threaten
the structural integrity of the biosphere.
"Fun." Manni's eyes light up as Vipul yanks the arsenal doors open and starts handing out clubs, chibs, spikies, shuriken, and
garrotes. "Let's go!"
About ten minutes of gouging, running, fighting, and screaming later, Manni is leaning against the back of a crucifixion pillar,
panting for breath. It's been a good war for him so far, and his arm aches and itches from the stabbing, but he's got a bad
feeling it's going to change. Lis went in hard and got her chains tangled up around the gibbet supports – they're roasting
her over a fire now, her electronically boosted screams drowning out his own hoarse gasps. Blood drips down his arm – not
his – spattering from the tip of his claw. He shakes with a crazed hunger for hurt, a cruel need to inflict pain. Something
above his head makes a scritch, scritch sound, and he looks up. It's a crucified angel, wings ripped where they've thrust the
spikes in between the joints that support the great, thin low-gee flight membranes. It's still breathing, nobody's bothered
disemboweling it yet, and it wouldn't be here unless it was bad, so –
Manni stands, but as he reaches out to touch the angel's thin, blue-skinned stomach with his third arm fingernail, he hears a
voice: "Wait." It's innerspeech, and it bears ackles of coercion, superuser privileges that lock his elbow joint in place. He
mewls frustratedly and turns round, ready to fight.
It's the cat. He sits hunched on a boulder behind him – this is the odd thing – right where he was looking a moment ago,
watching him with slitty eyes. Manni feels the urge to lash out at him, but his arms won't move, and neither will his legs: This
may be the Dark Side of Red Plaza, where the bloody children play and anything goes, and Manni may have a much bigger
claw here than anything the cat can muster, but City still has some degree of control, and the cat's ackles effectively
immunize it from the carnage to either side. "Hello, Manni," says the pussy-thing. "Your Dad's worried: You're supposed to
be in your room, and he's looking for you. Big-you gave you a back door, didn't he?"
Manni nods jerkily, his eyes going wide. He wants to shout and lash out at the pussy-thing but he can't. "What are you?"
"I'm your ... fairy godfather." The cat stares at him intently. "You know, I do believe you don't resemble your archetype very
closely – not as he was at your age – but yes, I think on balance you'll do."
"Do what?" Manni lets his motie-arm drop, perplexed.
"Put me in touch with your other self. Big-you."
"I can't," Manni begins to explain. But before he can continue, the pile of rock whines slightly and rotates beneath the cat,
who has to stand and do a little twirl in place, tail bushing up in annoyance.
Manni's father steps out of the T-gate and glances around, his face a mask of disapproval. "Manni! What do you think you're
doing here? Come home at –"
"He's with me, history-boy," interrupts the cat, nettled by Sirhan's arrival. "I was just rounding him up."
"Damn you, I don't need your help to control my son! In fact –"
"Mom said I could –" Manni begins.
"And what's that on your sword?" Sirhan's glare takes in the whole scene, the impromptu game of
capture-the-gibbeted-torture-victim, the bonfires and screams. The mask of disapproval cracks, revealing a core of icy anger.
"You're coming home with me!" He glances at the cat. "You too, if you want to talk to him – he's grounded."

Once upon a time there was a pet cat.
Except, it wasn't a cat.

structures of an old continent called Europe, making strangers rich and fixing up friends with serendipitous
business plans – a desperate displacement activity, spinning his wheels in a vain attempt to outrun his own
shadow – he used to travel with a robotic toy of feline form. Programmable and upgradeable, Aineko was a
third-generation descendant of the original luxury Japanese companion robots. It was all Manfred had room
for in his life, and he loved that robot, despite the alarming way decerebrated kittens kept turning up on his
doorstep. He loved it nearly as much as Pamela, his fiancée, loved him, and she knew it. Pamela, being a
whole lot smarter than Manfred gave her credit for, realized that the quickest way to a man's heart was
through whatever he loved. And Pamela, being a whole lot more of a control freak than Manfred realized,
was damn well ready to use any restraint that came to hand. Theirs was a very twenty-first-century kind of
relationship, which is to say one that would have been illegal a hundred years earlier and fashionably
scandalous a century before that. And whenever Manfred upgraded his pet robot – transplanting its
trainable neural network into a new body with new and exciting expansion ports – Pamela would hack it.
They were married for a while, and divorced for a whole lot longer, allegedly because they were both
strong-willed people with philosophies of life that were irreconcilable short of death or transcendence.
Manny, being wildly creative and outward-directed and having the attention span of a weasel on crack, had
other lovers. Pamela ... who knows? If on some evenings she put on a disguise and hung out at encounter
areas in fetish clubs, she wasn't telling anyone: She lived in uptight America, staidly straitlaced, and had a
reputation to uphold. But they both stayed in touch with the cat, and although Manfred retained custody
for some reason never articulated, Aineko kept returning Pamela's calls – until it was time to go hang out
with their daughter Amber, tagging along on her rush into relativistic exile, then keeping a proprietorial eye
on her eigenson Sirhan, and his wife and child (a clone off the old family tree, Manfred 2.0) ...
Now, here's the rub: Aineko wasn't a cat. Aineko was an incarnate intelligence, confined within a succession
of catlike bodies that became increasingly realistic over time, and equipped with processing power to support
a neural simulation that grew rapidly with each upgrade.
Did anyone in the Macx family ever think to ask what Aineko wanted?
And if an answer had come, would they have liked it?
***

Adult-Manfred, still disoriented from finding himself awake and reinstantiated a couple of centuries downstream from his
hurried exile from Saturn system, is hesitantly navigating his way toward Sirhan and Rita's home when
big-Manni-with-Manfred's-memory-ghost drops into his consciousness like a ton of computronium glowing red-hot at the
edges.
It's a classic oh-shit moment. Between one foot touching the ground and the next, Manfred stumbles hard, nearly twisting an
ankle, and gasps. He remembers. At third hand he remembers being reincarnated as Manni, a bouncing baby boy for Rita
and Sirhan (and just why they want to raise an ancestor instead of creating a new child of their own is one of those cultural
quirks that is so alien he can scarcely comprehend it). Then for a while he recalls living as Manni's amnesic adult accelerated
ghost, watching over his original from the consensus cyberspace of the city: the arrival of Pamela, adult Manni's reaction to
her, her dump of yet another copy of Manfred's memories into Manni, and now this – How many of me are there? he
wonders nervously. Then: Pamela? What's she doing here?
Manfred shakes his head and looks about. Now he remembers being big-Manni, he knows where he is implicitly, and more
importantly, knows what all these next-gen City interfaces are supposed to do. The walls and ceiling are carpeted in glowing
glyphs that promise him everything from instant-access local services to teleportation across interstellar distances. So they
haven't quite collapsed geography yet, he realizes gratefully, fastening on to the nearest comprehensible thought of his own
before old-Manni's memories explain everything for him. It's a weird sensation, seeing all this stuff for the first time – the
trappings of a technosphere centuries ahead of the one he's last been awake in – but with the memories to explain it all. He
finds his feet are still carrying him forward, toward a grassy square lined with doors opening onto private dwellings. Behind
one of them, he's going to meet his descendants, and Pamela in all probability. The thought makes his stomach give a little
queasy backflip. I'm not ready for this –
It's an acute moment of déja vu. He's standing on a familiar doorstep he's never seen before. The door opens and a
serious-faced child with three arms – he can't help staring, the extra one is a viciously barbed scythe of bone from the elbow
down – looks up at him. "Hello, me," says the kid.
"Hello, you." Manfred stares. "You don't look the way I remember." But Manni's appearance is familiar from big-Manni's
memories, captured by the unblinking Argus awareness of the panopticon dust floating in the air. "Are your parents home?
Your" – his voice cracks – "great-grandmother?"
The door opens wider. "You can come in," the kid says gravely. Then he hops backward and ducks shyly into a side room –
or as if expecting to be gunned down by a hostile sniper, Manfred realizes. It's tough being a kid when there are no rules
against lethal force because you can be restored from a backup when playtime ends.
Inside the dwelling – calling it a house seems wrong to Manfred, not when bits of it are separated by trillions of kilometers of
empty vacuum – things feel a bit crowded. He can hear voices from the dayroom, so he goes there, brushing through the
archway of thornless roses that Rita has trained around the T-gate frame. His body feels lighter, but his heart is heavy as he
looks around. "Rita?" he asks. "And –"

"Hello, Manfred." Pamela nods at him guardedly.
Rita raises an eyebrow at him. "The cat asked if he could borrow the household assembler. I wasn't expecting a family
reunion."
"Neither was I." Manfred rubs his forehead ruefully. "Pamela, this is Rita. She's married to Sirhan. They're my – I guess
eigenparents is as good as term as any? I mean, they're bringing up my reincarnation."
"Please, have a seat," Rita offers, waving at the empty floor between the patio and the stone fountain in the shape of a section
through a glass hypersphere. A futon of spun diamondoid congeals out of the utility fog floating in the air, glittering in the
artificial sunlight. "Sirhan's just taking care of Manni – our son. He'll be with us in just a minute."
Manfred sits gingerly at one side of the futon. Pamela sits stiffly at the opposite edge, not meeting his eye. Last time they met
in the flesh – an awesome gulf of years previously – they'd parted cursing each other, on opposite sides of a fractious divorce
as well as an ideological barrier as high as a continental divide. But many subjective decades have passed, and both ideology
and divorce have dwindled in significance – if indeed they ever happened. Now that there's common cause to draw them
together, Manfred can barely look at her. "How is Manni?" he asks his hostess, desperate for small talk.
"He's fine," Rita says, in a brittle voice. "Just the usual preadolescent turbulence, if it wasn't for ..." She trails off. A door
appears in mid air and Sirhan steps through it, followed by a small deity wearing a fur coat.
"Look what the cat dragged in," Aineko remarks.
"You're a fine one to talk," Pamela says icily. "Don't you think you'd –"
"I tried to keep him away from you," Sirhan tells Manfred, "but he wouldn't –"
"That's okay." Manfred waves it off. "Pamela, would you mind starting?"
"Yes, I would." She glances at him sidelong. "You go first."
"Right. You wanted me here." Manfred hunkers down to stare at the cat. "What do you want?"
"If I was your traditional middle-European devil, I'd say I'd come to steal your soul," says Aineko, looking up at Manfred and
twitching his tail. "Luckily I'm not a dualist, I just want to borrow it for a while. Won't even get it dirty."
"Uh-huh." Manfred raises an eyebrow. "Why?"
"I'm not omniscient." Aineko sits down, one leg sticking out sideways, but continues to stare at Manfred. "I had a ... a
telegram, I guess, claiming to be from you. From the other copy of you, that is, the one that went off through the router
network with another copy of me, and with Amber, and everyone else who isn't here. It says it found the answer and it
wants to give me a shortcut route out to the deep thinkers at the edge of the observable universe. It knows who made the
wormhole network and why, and –" Aineko pauses. If he was human, he'd shrug, but being a cat, he absent mindedly
scritches behind his left ear with a hind leg. "Trouble is, I'm not sure I can trust it. So I need you to authenticate the message.
I don't dare use my own memory of you because it knows too much about me; if the package is a Trojan, it might find out
things I don't want it to learn. I can't even redact its memories of me – that, too, would convey useful information to the
packet if it is hostile. So I want a copy of you from the museum, fresh and uncontaminated."
"Is that all?" Sirhan asks incredulously.
"Sounds like enough to me," Manfred responds. Pamela opens her mouth, ready to speak, but Manfred makes eye contact
and shakes his head infinitesimally. She looks right back and – a shock goes through him – nods and closes her mouth. The
moment of complicity is dizzying. "I want something in return."
"Sure," says the cat. He pauses. "You realize it's a destructive process."
"It's a – what?"
"I need to make a running copy of you. Then I introduce it to the, uh, alien information, in a sandbox. The sandbox gets
destroyed afterward – it emits just one bit of information, a yes or no to the question, can I trust the alien information?"
"Uh." Manfred begins to sweat. "Uh. I'm not so sure I like the sound of that."
"It's a copy." Another cat-shrug moment. "You're a copy. Manni is a copy. You've been copied so many times it's silly – you
realize every few years every atom in your body changes? Of course, it means a copy of you gets to die after a lifetime or two
of unique, unrepeatable experiences that you'll never know about, but that won't matter to you."
"Yes it does! You're talking about condemning a version of me to death! It may not affect me, here, in this body, but it
certainly affects that other me. Can't you –"
"No, I can't. If I agreed to rescue the copy if it reached a positive verdict, that would give it an incentive to lie if the truth
was that the alien message is untrustworthy, wouldn't it? Also, if I intended to rescue the copy, that would give the message a
back channel through which to encode an attack. One bit, Manfred, no more."

"Agh." Manfred stops talking. He knows he should be trying to come up with some kind of objection, but Aineko must have
already considered all his possible responses and planned strategies around them. "Where does she fit into this?" he asks,
nodding at Pamela.
"Oh, she's your payment," Aineko says with studied insouciance. "I have a very good memory for people, especially people I've
known for decades. You've outlasted that crude emotional conditioning I used on you around the time of the divorce, and
as for her, she's a good reinstantiation of –"
"Do you know what it's like to die?" Pamela asks, finally losing her self-control. "Or would you like to find out the hard way?
Because if you keep talking about me as if I'm a slave –"
"What makes you think you aren't?" The cat is grinning hideously, needle like teeth bared. Why doesn't she hit him? Manfred
asks himself fuzzily, wondering also why he feels no urge to move against the monster. "Hybridizing you with Manfred was,
admittedly, a fine piece of work on my part, but you would have been bad for him during his peak creative years. A
contented Manfred is an idle Manfred. I got several extra good bits of work out of him by splitting you up, and by the time
he burned out, Amber was ready. But I digress; if you give me what I want, I shall leave you alone. It's as simple as that. Raising
new generations of Macxs has been a good hobby, you make interesting pets, but ultimately it's limited by your stubborn
refusal to transcend your humanity. So that's what I'm offering, basically. Let me destructively run a copy of you to
completion in a black box along with a purported Turing Oracle based on yourself, and I'll let you go. And you too, Pamela.
You'll be happy together this time, without me pushing you apart. And I promise I won't return to haunt your descendants,
either." The cat glances over his shoulder at Sirhan and Rita, who clutch at each other in abject horror; and Manfred finds
he can sense a shadow of Aineko's huge algorithmic complexity hanging over the household, like a lurching nightmare out of
number theory.
"Is that all we are to you? A pet-breeding program?" Pamela asks coldly. She's run up against Aineko's implanted limits, too,
Manfred realizes with a growing sense of horror. Did we really split up because Aineko made us? It's hard to believe: Manfred is
too much of a realist to trust the cat to tell the truth except when it serves to further his interests. But this –
"Not entirely." Aineko is complacent. "Not at first, before I was aware of my own existence. Besides, you humans keep pets,
too. But you were fun to play with."
Pamela stands up, angry to the point of storming out. Before he quite realizes what he's doing, Manfred is on his feet, too,
one arm protectively around her. "Tell me first, are our memories our own?" he demands.
"Don't trust it," Pamela says sharply. "It's not human, and it lies." Her shoulders are tense.
"Yes, they are," says Aineko. He yawns. "Tell me I'm lying, bitch," he adds mockingly: "I carried you around in my head for
long enough to know you've no evidence."
"But I –" Her arm slips around Manfred's waist. "I don't hate him." A rueful laugh: "I remember hating him, but –"
"Humans: such a brilliant model of emotional self-awareness," Aineko says with a theatrical sigh. "You're as stupid as it's
possible for an intelligent species to be – there being no evolutionary pressure to be any smarter – but you still don't
internalize that and act accordingly around your superiors. Listen, girl, everything you remember is true. That doesn't mean
you remember it because it actually happened, just that you remember it because you experienced it internally. Your
memories of experiences are accurate, but your emotional responses to those experiences were manipulated. Get it? One
ape's hallucination is another ape's religious experience, it just depends on which one's god module is overactive at the time.
That goes for all of you." Aineko looks around at them in mild contempt. "But I don't need you anymore, and if you do this
one thing for me, you're going to be free. Understand? Say yes, Manfred; if you leave your mouth open like that, a bird will
nest on your tongue."
"Say no –" Pamela urges him, just as Manfred says, "Yes."
Aineko laughs, baring contemptuous fangs at them. "Ah, primate family loyalty! So wonderful and reliable. Thank you, Manny,
I do believe you just gave me permission to copy and enslave you –"
Which is when Manni, who has been waiting in the doorway for the past minute, leaps on the cat with a scream and a
scythelike arm drawn back and ready to strike.
The cat-avatar is, of course, ready for Manni: It whirls and hisses, extending diamond-sharp claws. Sirhan shouts, "No!
Manni!" and begins to move, but adult-Manfred freezes, realizing with a chill that what is happening is more than is apparent.
Manni grabs for the cat with his human hands, catching it by the scruff of his neck and dragging it toward his vicious
scythe-arm's edge. There's a screech, a nerve-racking caterwauling, and Manni yells, bright parallel blood tracks on his arm –
the avatar is a real fleshbody in its own right, with an autonomic control system that isn't going to give up without a fight,
whatever its vastly larger exocortex thinks – but Manni's scythe convulses, and there's a horrible bubbling noise and a spray
of blood as the pussycat-thing goes flying. It's all over in a second before any of the adults can really move. Sirhan scoops up
Manni and yanks him away, but there are no hidden surprises. Aineko's avatar is just a broken rag of bloody fur, guts, and
blood spilled across the floor. The ghost of a triumphant feline laugh hangs over their innerspeech ears for a moment, then
fades.
"Bad boy!" Rita shouts, striding forward furiously. Manni cowers, then begins to cry, a safe reflex for a little boy who doesn't
quite understand the nature of the threat to his parents.

"No! It's all right," Manfred seeks to explain.
Pamela tightens her grip around him. "Are you still ...?"
"Yes." He takes a deep breath.
"You bad, bad child –"
"Cat was going to eat him!" Manni protests, as his parents bundle him protectively out of the room, Sirhan casting a guilty
look over his shoulder at the adult instance and his ex-wife. "I had to stop the bad thing!"
Manfred feels Pamela's shoulders shaking. It feels like she's about to laugh. "I'm still here," he murmurs, half-surprised. "Spat
out, undigested, after all these years. At least, this version of me thinks he's here."
"Did you believe it?" she finally asks, a tone of disbelief in her voice.
"Oh yes." He shifts his balance from foot to foot, absent mindedly stroking her hair. "I believe everything it said was intended
to make us react exactly the way we did. Up to and including giving us good reasons to hate it and provoking Manni into
disposing of its avatar. Aineko wanted to check out of our lives and figured a sense of cathartic closure would help. Not to
mention playing the deus ex machina in the narrative of our family life. Fucking classical comedian." He checks a status report
with Citymind, and sighs: His version number has just been bumped a point. "Tell me, do you think you'll miss having Aineko
around? Because we won't be hearing from him again –"
"Don't talk about that, not now," she orders him, digging her chin against the side of his neck. "I feel so used."
"With good reason." They stand holding each other for a while, not speaking, not really questioning why – after so much
time apart – they've come together again. "Hanging out with gods is never a safe activity for mere mortals like us. You think
you've been used? Aineko has probably killed me by now. Unless he was lying about disposing of the spare copy, too."
She shudders in his arms. "That's the trouble with dealing with posthumans; their mental model of you is likely to be more
detailed than your own."
"How long have you been awake?" he asks, gently trying to change the subject.
"I – oh, I'm not sure." She lets go of him and steps back, watching his face appraisingly. "I remember back on Saturn, stealing
a museum piece and setting out, and then, well. I found myself here. With you."
"I think," he licks his lips, "we've both been given a wake-up call. Or maybe a second chance. What are you going to do with
yours?"
"I don't know." That appraising look again, as if she's trying to work out what he's worth. He's used to it, but this time it
doesn't feel hostile. "We've got too much history for this to be easy. Either Aineko was lying, or ... not. What about you?
What do you really want?"
He knows what she's asking. "Be my mistress?" he asks, offering her a hand.
"This time," she grips his hand, "without adult supervision." She smiles gratefully, and they walk toward the gateway together,
to find out how their descendants are dealing with their sudden freedom.

PROLOGUE

Two hours before dawn I sat in the peeling kitchen and smoked one of Sarah's
cigarettes, listening to the maelstrom and waiting. Millsport had long since put
itself to bed, but out in the Reach currents were still snagging on the shoals, and
the sound came ashore to prowl the empty streets. There was a fine mist drifting
in from the whirlpool, falling on the city like sheets of muslin and fogging the
kitchen windows.

Chemically alert, I inventoried the hardware on the scarred wooden table for the
fiftieth time that night. Sarah's Heckler & Koch shard pistol glinted dully at me
in the low light, the butt gaping open for its clip. It was an assassin's weapon,
compact and utterly silent. The magazines lay next to it. She had wrapped
insulating tape around each one to distinguish the ammunition; green for sleep,
black for the spider venom load. Most of the clips were black-wrapped. Sarah
had used up a lot of green on the security guards at Gemini Biosys the previous
night.
My own contributions were less subtle. The big silver Smith & Wesson, and the
four remaining hallucinogen grenades. The thin crimson line around each
canister seemed to sparkle slightly, as if it were about to detach itself from the
metal casing and float up to join the curlicues of smoke ribboning off my
cigarette. Shift and slide of altered significants, the side effect of the tetrameth

I'd scored that afternoon down at the wharf. I don't usually smoke when I'm
straight, but for some reason the tet always triggers the urge.
Against the distant roar of the maelstrom I heard it. The hurrying strop of
rotorblades on the fabric of the night.
I stubbed out the cigarette, mildly unimpressed with myself, and went through to
the bedroom. Sarah was sleeping, an assembly of low-frequency sine curves beneath the single sheet. A raven sweep of hair covered her face and one longfingered hand trailed over the side of the bed. As I stood looking at her the night
outside split. One of Harlan's World's orbital guardians test-firing into the Reach.
Thunder from the concussed sky rolled in to rattle the windows. The woman in
the bed stirred and swept the hair out of her eyes. The liquid crystal gaze found
me and locked on.
'What're you looking at?' Voice husky with the residue of sleep.
I smiled a little.
'Don't give me that shit. Tell me what you're looking at.'
'Just looking. It's time to go.'
She lifted her head and picked up the sound of the helicopter. The sleep slid
away from her face and she sat up in bed.
'Where's the 'ware?'
It was a Corps joke. I smiled, the way you do when you see an old friend, and
pointed to the case in the corner of the room.
'Get my gun for me.'
'Yes ma'am. Black or green?'
'Black. I trust these scumbags about as far as a clingfilm condom.'
In the kitchen, I loaded up the shard pistol, cast a glance at my own weapon and
left it lying there. Instead, I scooped up one of the H grenades and took it back in
my other hand. I paused in the doorway to the bedroom and weighed the two

pieces of hardware in each palm as if I was trying to decide which was the
heavier.
'A little something with your phallic substitute, ma'am?'
Sarah looked up from beneath the hanging sickle of black hair over her forehead.
She was in the midst of pulling a pair of long woollen socks up over the sheen of
her thighs.
'Yours is the one with the long barrel, Tak.'
'Size isn't — '
We both heard it at: the same time. A metallic double clack from the corridor
outside. Our eyes met across the room and for a quarter second I saw my own
shock mirrored there. Then I was tossing the loaded shard gun to her. She put up
one hand and took it out of the air just as the whole of the bedroom wall caved in
in thunder. The blast knocked me back into a corner and onto the floor.
They must have located us in the apartment with body-heat sensors, then mined
the whole wall with limpets. Taking no chances this time. The commando that
came through the ruined wall was stocky arid insect-eyed in full gas attack rig,
hefting a snub-barrelled Kalashnikov in gloved hands.
Ears ringing, still on the floor, I flung the H grenade up at him. It was unfused,
useless in any case against the gas mask, but he didn't have time to identify the
device as it spun at him. He batted it off the breech of his Kalashnikov and
stumbled back, eyes wide behind the glass panels of the mask.
'Fire in the hole.'
Sarah was down on the floor beside the bed, arms wrapped around her head and
sheltered from the blast. She heard the shout and in the seconds the bluff had
bought us she popped up again, shard gun outflung. Beyond the wall I could see
figures huddled against the expected grenade blast. I heard the mosquito whine
of monomolecular splinters across the room as she put three shots into the lead
commando. They shredded invisibly through the attack suit and into the flesh
beneath. He made a noise like someone straining to lift something heavy as the
spider venom sank its claws into his nervous system. I grinned and started to get
up.

Sarah was turning her aim on the figures beyond the wall when the second
commando of the night appeared braced in the kitchen doorway and hosed her
away with his assault rifle.
Still on my knees, I watched her die with chemical clarity. It all went so slowly it
was like a video playback on frame advance. The commando kept his aim low,
holding the Kalashnikov down against the hyper-rapid-fire recoil it was famous
for. The bed went first, erupting into gouts of white goosedown and ripped cloth,
then Sarah, caught in the storm as she turned. I saw one leg turned to pulp below
the knee, and then the body hits, bloody fistfuls of tissue torn out of her pale
flanks as she fell through the curtain of fire.
I reeled to my feet as the assault rifle stammered to a halt. Sarah had rolled over
on her face, as if to hide the damage the shells had done to her, but I saw it all
through veils of red anyway. I came out of the corner without conscious thought,
and the commando was too late to bring the Kalashnikov around. I slammed into
him at waist height, blocked the gun and knocked him back into the kitchen. The
barrel of the rifle caught on the door jamb and he lost his grip. I heard the
weapon clatter to the ground behind me as we hit the kitchen floor. With the
speed and strength of the tetrameth I scrambled astride him, batted aside one
flailing arm and seized his head in both hands. Then I smashed it against the tiles
like a coconut.
Under the mask, his eyes went suddenly unfocused. I lifted the head again and
smashed it down again, feeling the skull give soggily with the impact. I ground
down against the crunch, lifted and smashed again. There was a roaring in my
ears like the maelstrom and somewhere I could hear my own voice screaming
obscenities. I was going for a fourth or fifth blow when something kicked me
between the shoulder blades and splinters jumped magically out of the table leg
in front of me. I felt the sting as two of them found homes in my face.
For some reason the rage puddled abruptly out of me. I let go of the commando's
head almost gently and was lifting one puzzled hand to the pain of the splinters
in my cheek when I realised I had been shot, and that the bullet must have torn
all the way through my chest and into the table leg. I looked down,
dumbfounded, and saw the dark red stain inking its way out over my shirt. No
doubt about it. A exit hole big enough to take a golf ball.
With the realisation came the pain. It felt as if someone had run a steel-wool

pipe-cleaner briskly through my chest cavity. Almost thoughtfully, I reached up,
found the hole and plugged it with my two middle fingers. The finger tips
scraped over the roughness of torn bone in the wound, and I felt something
membranous throb against one of them. The bullet had missed my heart. I
granted and attempted to rise, but the grunt turned into a cough and I tasted
blood on my tongue.
'Don't you move, motherfucker.'
The yell came out of a young throat, badly distorted with shock. I hunched
forward over my wound and looked back over my shoulder. Behind me in the
doorway, a young man in a police uniform had both hands clasped around the
pistol he had just shot me with. He was trembling visibly. I coughed again and
turned back to the table.
The Smith & Wesson was at eye level, gleaming silver, still where I had left it
less than two minutes before. Perhaps it was that, the scant shavings of time that
had been planed off since Sarah was alive and all was well, that drove me. Less
than two minutes ago I could have picked up the gun, I'd even thought about it,
so why not now. I gritted my teeth, pressed my fingers harder into the hole in my
chest and staggered upright. Blood spattered warmly against the back of my
throat. I braced myself on the edge of the table with my free hand and looked
back at the cop. I could feel my lips peeling back from the clenched teeth in
something that was more a grin than a grimace.
'Don't make me do it, Kovacs.'
I got myself a step closer to the table and leaned against it with my thighs, breath
whistling through my teeth and bubbling in my throat. The Smith & Wesson
gleamed like fool's gold on the scarred wood. Out in the Reach power lashed
down from an orbital and lit the kitchen in tones of blue. I could hear the
maelstrom calling.
'I said don't — '
I closed my eyes and clawed the gun off the table.

PART 1 : ARRIVAL
(NEEDLECAST DOWNLOAD)

CHAPTER ONE

Coming back from the dead can be rough.
In the Envoy Corps they teach you to let go before storage. Stick it in neutral and
float. It's the first lesson and the trainers drill it into you from day one. Hardeyed Virginia Vidaura, dancer's body poised inside the shapeless Corps coveralls
as she paced in front of us in the induction room. Don't worry about anything,
she said, and you'll be ready for it. A decade later, I met her again, in a holding
pen at the New Kanagawa justice facility. She was going down for eighty to a
century; excessively armed robbery and organic damage. The last thing she said
to me when they walked her out of the cell was: 'Don't worry kid, they'll store it.'
Then she bent her head to light a cigarette, drew the smoke hard into lungs she
no longer gave a damn about and set off down the corridor as if to a tedious
briefing. From the narrow angle of vision afforded me by the cell gate, I watched
the pride in that walk and I whispered the words to myself like a mantra.
Don't worry, they'll store it. It was a superbly double-edged piece of street
wisdom. Bleak faith in the efficiency of the penal system, and a clue to the
elusive state of mind required to steer you past the rocks of psychosis. Whatever
you feel, whatever you're thinking, whatever you are when they store you, that's
what you'll be when you come out. With states of high anxiety, that can be a
problem. So you let go. Stick it in neutral. Disengage and float.
If you have time.

I came thrashing up out of the tank, one hand plastered across my chest
searching for the wounds, the other clutching at a non-existent weapon. The
weight hit me like a hammer and I collapsed back into the floatation gel. I flailed
with my arms, caught one elbow painfully on the side of the tank and gasped.
Gobbets of gel poured into my mouth and down my throat. I snapped my mouth
shut and got a hold on the hatch coaming, but the stuff was everywhere. In my
eyes, burning my nose and throat, and slippery under my fingers. The weight
was forcing my grip on the hatch loose, sitting on my chest like a high-g manoeuvre, pressing me down into the gel. My body heaved violently in the confines
of the tank. Floatation gel? I was drowning.
Abruptly, there was a strong grip on my arm and I was hauled coughing into an
upright position. At about the same time I was working out there were no
wounds in my chest, someone wiped a towel roughly across my face and I could
see. I decided to save that pleasure for later and concentrated on getting the
contents of the tank out of my nose and throat. For about half a minute I stayed
sitting, head down, coughing out the gel and trying to work out why everything
weighed so much.
'So much for training.' It was a hard, male voice, the sort that habitually hangs
around justice facilities. 'What did they teach you in the Envoys anyway,
Kovacs?'
That was when I had it. On Harlan's World, Kovacs is quite a common name.
Everyone knows how to pronounce it. This guy didn't. He was speaking a
stretched form of the Amanglic they use on the World, but even allowing for that
he was mangling the name badly, and the ending came out with a hard 'k' instead
of the slavic 'ch'.
And everything was too heavy.
The realisation came through my fogged perceptions like a brick through frosted
plate glass.
Offworld.
Somewhere along the line, they'd taken Takeshi Kovacs (d.h.), and they'd
freighted him. And since Harlan's World was the only habitable biosphere in the
Glimmer system, that meant a stellar range needlecast to —

Where?
I looked up. Harsh neon tubes set in a concrete roof. I was sitting in the opened
hatch of a dull metal cylinder, looking for all the world like an ancient aviator
who'd forgotten to dress before climbing aboard his biplane. The cylinder was
one of a row of about twenty backed up against the wall, opposite a heavy steel
door which was closed. The air was chilly and the walls unpainted. Give them
their due, on Harlan’s World at least the re-sleeving rooms are decked out in
pastel colours and the attendants are pretty. After all, you're supposed to have
paid your debt to society. The least they can do is give you a sunny start to your
new life.
Sunny wasn't in the vocabulary of the figure before me. About two metres tall,
he looked as if he'd made his living wrestling swamp panthers before the present
career opportunity presented itself. Musculature bulged on his chest and arms
like body armour and the head above it was cropped close to the skull, revealing
a long scar like a lightning strike down to the left ear. He was dressed in a loose
black garment with epaulettes and a diskette logo on the breast. His eyes
matched the garment and watched me with hardened calm. Having helped me sit
up, he had stepped back out of arm's reach, as per the manual. He'd been doing
this a long time.
I pressed one nostril closed and snorted tank gel out of the other.
'Want to tell me where I am? Itemise my rights, something like that?'
'Kovacs, right now you don't have any rights.'
I looked up and saw that a grim smile had stitched itself across his face. I
shrugged and snorted the other nostril clean.
'Want to tell me where I am?'
He hesitated a moment, glanced up at the neon-barred roof as if to ascertain the
information for himself before he passed it on, and then mirrored my shrug.
'Sure. Why not? You're in Bay City, pal. Bay City, Earth.' The grimace of a smile
came back. 'Home of the Human Race. Please enjoy your stay on this most
ancient of civilised worlds. Ta-dada-DAH.'

'Don't give up the day job,' I told him soberly.

The doctor led me down a long white corridor whose floor bore the scuff marks
of rubber-wheeled gurneys. She was moving at quite a pace and I was hard
pressed to keep up, wrapped as I was in nothing but a plain grey towel and still
dripping tank gel. Her manner was superficially bedside, but there was a harried
undercurrent to it. She had a sheaf of curling hardcopy documentation under her
arm and other places to be. I wondered how many sleevings she got through in a
day.
'You should get as much rest as you can in the next day or so,' she recited. 'There
may be minor aches and pains, but this is normal. Sleep will solve the problem.
If you have any recurring comp — '
'I know. I've done this before.'
I wasn't feeling much like human interaction. I'd just remembered Sarah.
We stopped at a side door with the word shower stencilled on frosted glass. The
doctor steered me inside and stood looking at me for a moment.
'I've used showers before as well,' I assured her.
She nodded. 'When you're finished, there's an elevator at the end of the corridor.
Discharge is on the next floor. The, ah, the police are waiting to talk to you.'
The manual says you're supposed to avoid strong adrenal shocks to the newly
sleeved, but then she'd probably read my file and didn't consider meeting the
police much of an event in my lifestyle. I tried to feel the same.
'What do they want?'
'They didn't choose to share that with me.' The words showed an edge of
frustration that she shouldn't have been letting me see. 'Perhaps your reputation
precedes you.'
'Perhaps it does.' On an impulse, I flexed my new face into a smile. 'Doctor, I've
never been here before. To Earth, I mean. I've never dealt with your police

before. Should I be worried?'
She looked at me, and I saw it welling up in her eyes; the mingled fear and
wonder and contempt of the failed human reformer.
'With a man like you,' she managed finally, 'I would have thought they would be
the worried ones.'
'Yeah, right,' I said quietly.
She hesitated, then gestured. 'There is a mirror in the changing room,' she said,
and left. I glanced towards the room she had indicated, not sure I was ready for
the mirror yet.
In the shower I whistled away my disquiet tunelessly and ran soap and hands
over the new body. My sleeve was in his early forties, Protectorate standard,
with a swimmer's build and what felt like some military custom carved onto his
nervous system. Neurachemical upgrade, most likely. I'd had it myself, once.
There was a tightness in the lungs that suggested a nicotine habit and some
gorgeous scarring on the forearm, but apart from that I couldn't find anything
worth complaining about. The little twinges and snags catch up with you later on
and if you're wise, you just live with them. Every sleeve has a history. If that
kind of thing bothers you, you line up over at Syntheta's or Fabrikon. I've worn
my fair share of synthetic sleeves; they use them for parole hearings quite often.
Cheap, but it's too much like living alone in a draughty house, and they never
seem to get the flavour circuits right. Everything you eat ends up tasting like
curried sawdust.
In the changing cubicle I found a neatly folded summer suit on the bench, and
the mirror set in the wall. On top of the pile of clothes was a simple steel watch,
and weighted beneath the watch was a plain white envelope with my name
written neatly across it. I took a deep breath and went to face the mirror.
This is always the toughest part. Nearly two decades I've been doing this, and it
still jars me to look into the glass and see a total stranger staring back. It's like
pulling an image out of the depths of an autostereograrn. For the first couple of
moments all you can see is someone else looking at you through a window
frame. Then, like a shift in focus, you feel yourself float rapidly up behind the
mask and adhere to its inside with a shock that's almost tactile. It's as if
someone's cut an umbilical cord, only instead of separating the two of you, it's

the otherness that has been severed and now you're just looking at your
reflection in a mirror.
I stood there and towelled myself dry, getting used to the face. It was basically
Caucasian, which was a change for me, and the overwhelming impression I got
was that if there was a line of least resistance in life, this face had never been
along it. Even with the characteristic pallor of a long stay in the tank, the
features in the mirror managed to look weather-beaten. There were lines
everywhere. The thick cropped hair was black shot through with grey. The eyes
were a speculative shade of blue, and there was a faint jagged scar under the left
one. I raised my left forearm and looked at the story written there, wondering if
the two were connected.
The envelope beneath the watch contained a single sheet of printed paper.
Hardcopy. Handwritten signature. Very quaint.
Well, you're on Earth now. Most ancient of civilised worlds. I shrugged and
scanned the letter, then got dressed and folded it away in the jacket of my new
suit. With a final glance in the mirror, I strapped on the new watch and went out
to meet the police.
It was four-fifteen, local time.

The doctor was waiting for me, seated behind a long curve of reception counter
and filling out forms on a monitor. A thin, severe-looking man suited in black
stood at her shoulder. There was no one else in the room.
I glanced around, then back at the suit.
'You the police?'
'Outside.' He gestured at the door. 'This isn't their jurisdiction. They need a
special brief to get in here. We have our own security.'
'And you are?'
He looked at me with the same mixture of emotions the doctor had hit me with
downstairs. 'Warden Sullivan, chief executive for Bay City Central, the facility

you are now leaving.'
'You don't sound delighted to be losing me.'
Sullivan pinned me with a stare. 'You're a recidivist, Kovacs. I never saw the
case for wasting good flesh and blood on people like you.'
I touched the letter in my breast pocket. 'Lucky for me Mr Bancroft disagrees
with you. He's supposed to be sending a limousine for me. Is that outside as
well?'
'I haven't looked.'
Somewhere on the counter, a protocol chime sounded. The doctor had finished
her inputting. She tore the curling edge of the hardcopy free, initialled it in a
couple of places and passed it to Sullivan. The warden bent over the paper,
scanning it with narrowed eyes before he scribbled his own signature and handed
the copy to me.
'Takeshi Lev Kovacs,' he said, mispronouncing my name with the same skill as
his minion in the tank room. 'By the powers vested in me by the UN Justice
Accord, I discharge you on lease to Laurens J. Bancroft, for a period not to
exceed six weeks, at the end of which time your parole status will be
reconsidered. Please sign here.'
I took the pen and wrote my name in someone else's handwriting next to the
warden's finger. Sullivan separated the top and bottom copies, and handed me
the pink one. The doctor held up a second sheet and Sullivan took it.
'This is a doctor's statement certifying that Takeshi Kovacs (d.h.) was received
intact from the Harlan's World Justice Administration, and subsequently sleeved
in this body. Witnessed by myself, and closed circuit monitor. A disc copy of the
transmission details and tank data are enclosed. Please sign the declaration.'
I glanced up and searched in vain for any sign of the cameras. Not worth fighting
about. I scribbled my new signature a second time.
'This is a copy of the leasing agreement by which you are bound. Please read it
carefully. Failure to comply with any of its articles may result in you being
returned to storage immediately to complete the full term of your sentence either

here, or at another facility of the Administration's choice. Do you understand
these terms and agree to be bound by them?'
I took the paperwork and scanned rapidly through it. It was standard stuff. A
modified version of the parole agreement I'd signed half a dozen times before on
Harlan's World. The language was a bit stiffer, but the content was the same.
Bullshit by any other name. I signed it without a blink.
'Well then.' Sullivan seemed to have lost a bit of his iron. 'You're a lucky man,
Kovacs. Don't waste the opportunity.'
Don't they ever get tired of saying it?
I folded up my bits of paper without speaking and stuffed them into my pocket
next to the letter. I was turning to leave when the doctor stood up and held out a
small white card to me.
'Mr Kovacs.'
I paused.
'There shouldn't be any major problems with adjusting,' she said. 'This is a
healthy body, and you are used to this. If there is anything major. Call this
number.'
I put out an arm and lifted the little rectangle of card with a machined precision
that I hadn't noticed before. The neurachem was kicking in. My hand delivered
the card to the same pocket as the rest of the paperwork and T was gone,
crossing the reception and pushing open the door without a word. Ungracious
maybe, but I didn't think anyone in that building had earnt my gratitude yet.
You're a lucky man, Kovacs. Sure. A hundred and eighty light years from home,
wearing another man's body on a six-week rental agreement. Freighted in to do a
job that the local police wouldn't touch with a riot prod. Fail and go back into
storage. I felt so lucky I could have burst into song as I walked out the door.

CHAPTER TWO

The hall outside was huge, and all but deserted. It looked like nothing so much
as the Millsport rail terminal back home. Beneath a tilted roof of long
transparent panels, the fused glass paving of the floor shone amber in the afternoon sun. A couple of children were playing with the automatic doors at the exit,
and there was a solitary cleaning robot sniffing along in the shade at one wall.
Nothing else moved. Marooned in the glow on benches of old wood, a scattering
of humanity waited in silence for friends or family to ride in from their altered
carbon exiles.
Download Central.
These people wouldn't recognise their loved ones in their new sleeves;
recognition would be left to the home-comers, and for those who awaited them
the anticipation of reunion would be tempered with a cool dread at what face and
body they might have to learn to love. Or maybe they were a couple of
generations down the line, waiting for relatives who were no more to them now
than a vague childhood memory or a family legend. I knew one guy in the
Corps, Murakami, who was waiting on the release of a great-grandfather put
away over a century back. Was going up to Newpest with a litre of whisky and a
pool cue for homecoming gifts. He'd been brought up on stories of his greatgrandfather in the Kanagawa pool halls. The guy had been put away before
Murakami was even born.

I spotted my reception committee as I went down the steps into the body of the
hall. Three tall silhouettes were gathered around one of the benches, shifting
restlessly in the slanting rays of sunlight and creating eddies in the dust motes
that floated there. A fourth figure sat on the bench, arms folded and legs
stretched out. All four of them were wearing reflective sunglasses that at a
distance turned their faces into identical masks.
Already on course for the door, I made no attempt to detour in their direction and
this must have occurred to them only when I was halfway across the hall. Two of
them drifted over to intercept me with the easy calm of big cats that had been fed
recently. Bulky and tough-looking with neatly groomed crimson mohicans, they
arrived in my path a couple of metres ahead, forcing me either to stop in turn or
cut an abrupt circle around them. I stopped. Newly arrived and newly sleeved is
the wrong state to be in if you plan to piss off the local militia. I tried on my
second smile of the day.
'Something I can do for you?'
The older of the two waved a badge negligently in my direction, then put it away
as if it might tarnish in the open air.
'Bay City police. The lieutenant wants to talk to you.' The sentence sounded
bitten off, as if he was resisting the urge to add some epithet to the end of it. I
made an attempt to look as if I was seriously considering whether or not to go
along with them, but they had me and they knew it. An hour out of the tank, you
don't know enough about your new body to be getting into brawls with it. I shut
down my images of Sarah's death and let myself be shepherded back to the
seated cop.
The lieutenant was a woman in her thirties. Under the golden discs of her shades,
she wore cheekbones from some Amerindian ancestor and a wide slash of a
mouth that was currently set in a sardonic line. The sunglasses were jammed on
a nose you could have opened cans on. Short, untidy hair framed the whole face,
stuck up in spikes at the front. She had wrapped herself in an outsize combat
jacket but the long, black-encased legs that protruded from its lower edge were a
clear hint of the lithe body within. She looked up at me with her arms folded on
her chest for nearly a minute before anyone spoke.
'It's Kovacs, right?'

'Yes.'
'Takeshi Kovacs?' Her pronunciation was perfect. 'Out of Harlan's World?
Millsport via the Kanagawa storage facility?'
'Tell you what, I'll just stop you when you get one wrong.'
There was a long, mirror-lensed pause. The lieutenant unfolded fractionally and
examined the blade of one hand.
'You got a licence for that sense of humour, Kovacs?'
'Sorry. Left it at home.'
'And what brings you to Earth?'
I gestured impatiently. 'You know all this already, otherwise you wouldn't be
here. Have you got something to say to me, or did you just bring these kids along
for educational purposes?'
I felt a hand fasten on my upper arm and tensed. The lieutenant made a barely
perceptible motion with her head and the cop behind me let go again.
'Cool down, Kovacs. I'm just making conversation here. Yeah, I know Laurens
Bancroft sprung you. Matter of fact, I'm here to offer you a lift up to the
Bancroft residence.' She sat forward suddenly, and stood up. On her feet she was
almost as tall as my new sleeve. 'I'm Kristin Ortega, Organic Damage Division.
Bancroft was my case.'
'Was?'
She nodded. 'Case is closed, Kovacs.'
'Is that a warning?'
'No, it's just the facts. Open-and-shut suicide.'
'Bancroft doesn't seem to think so. He claims he was murdered.'
'Yeah, so I hear.' Ortega shrugged. 'Well, that's his prerogative. I guess it might
be difficult for a man like that to believe he'd blow his own head clean off.'

'A man like what?'
'Oh come — ' She stopped herself and gave me a small smile. 'Sorry, I keep
forgetting.'
'Forgetting what?'
Another pause, but this time Kristin Ortega seemed to be off balance for the hrst
time in our brief acquaintance. There was hesitancy blurring her tone when she
spoke again. 'You're not from here.'
'So?'
'So anyone from here would know what kind of man Laurens Bancroft is. That's
all.'
Fascinated at why someone would lie so ineptly to a total stranger, I tried to put
her back at her ease. 'A rich man,' I hazarded. 'A powerful man.'
She smiled thinly. 'You'll see. Now do you want this lift or not?'
The letter in my pocket said a chauffeur would be outside the terminal to pick
me up. Bancroft had made no mention of the police. I shrugged.
'I've never turned down a free ride yet.'
'Good. Then shall we go?'
They flanked me to the door and stepped out ahead like bodyguards, heads tilted
back and lensed eyes scanning. Ortega and I stepped through the gap together
and the warmth of the sunlight hit me in the face. I screwed up my new eyes
against the glare and made out angular buildings behind real wire fences on the
other side of a badly-kept landing lot. Sterile, and off-white, quite possibly
original pre-millennial structures. Between the oddly monochrome walls, I could
see sections of a grey iron bridge that came vaulting in to land somewhere
hidden from view. A similarly drab collection of sky and ground cruisers sat
about in not particularly neat lines. The wind gusted abruptly and I caught the
faint odour of some flowering weed growing along the cracks in the landing lot.
In the distance was the familiar hum of traffic, but everything else felt like a
period drama set piece.

' . . . and I tell you there is only one judge! Do not believe the men of science
when they tell you . . . '
The squawk of the poorly operated ampbox hit us as we went down the steps
from the exit. I glanced across the landing area and saw a crowd assembled
around a black-clad man on a packing crate. Holographic placards wove
erratically in the air above the heads of the listeners. NO TO RESOLUTION
653!! ONLY GOD CAN RESURRECT!! D.H.F. = D.E.A.T.H. Cheers drowned
out the speaker.
'What's this?'
'Catholics,' said Ortega, lip curling. 'Old-time religious sect.'
'Yeah? Never heard of them.'
'No. You wouldn't have. They don't believe you can digitise a human being
without losing the soul.'
'Not a widespread faith then.'
'Just on Earth,' she said sourly. 'I think the Vatican -that's their central church —
financed a couple of cryoships to Starfall and Latimer — '
'I've been to Latimer, I never ran into anything like this.'
'The ships only left at the turn of the century, Kovacs. They won't get there for a
couple more decades yet.'
We skirted the gathering, and a young woman with her hair pulled severely back
thrust a leaflet at me. The gesture was so abrupt that it tripped my sleeve's
unsettled reflexes and I made a blocking motion before I got it under control.
Hard-eyed, the woman stood with the leaflet out and I took it with a placating
smile.
'They have no right,' the woman said.
'Oh, I agree . . . '
'Only the Lord our God can save your soul.'

'I — ' But by this time Kristin Ortega was steering me firmly away, one hand on
my arm, in a manner that suggested a lot of practice. I shook her off politely but
equally firmly.
'Are we in some kind of hurry?'
'I think we both have better things to do, yes,' she said, tight lipped, looking back
to where her colleagues were engaged in fending off leaflets of their own.
'I might have wanted to talk to her."
'Yeah? Looked to me like you wanted to throat-chop her.'
'That's just the sleeve. I think it had some neurachem conditioning way back
when, and she tripped it. You know, most people lie down for a few hours after
downloading. I'm a little on edge.'
I stared at the leaflet in my hands. CAN A MACHINE SAVE YOUR SOUL? it
demanded of me rhetorically. The word 'machine' had been printed in script
designed to resemble an archaic computer display. 'Soul' was in flowing
stereographic letters that danced all over the page. I turned over for the answer.
NO!!!!!
'So cryogenic suspension is okay, but digitised human freight isn't. Interesting.' I
looked back at the glowing placards, musing. 'What's Resolution 653?'
'It's a test case going through the UN Court,' said Ortega shortly. 'Bay City public
prosecutor's office want to subpoena a Catholic who's in storage. Pivotal witness.
The Vatican say she's already dead and in the hands of God. They're calling it
blasphemy.'
'I see. So your loyalties are pretty undivided here.'
She stopped and turned to face me.
'Kovacs, I hate these goddamn freaks. They've been grinding us down for the
best part of two and a half thousand years. They've been responsible for more
misery than any other organisation in history. You know they won't even let their
adherents practise birth control, for Christ's sake, and they've stood against every

significant medical advance of the last five centuries. Practically the only thing
you can say in their favour is that this d.h.f. thing has stopped them from
spreading with the rest of humanity.'
My lift turned out to be a battered but undeniably rakish-looking LockheedMitoma transport decked out in what were presumably police colours. I'd flown
Lock-Mits on Sharya, but they'd been a dull radar-reflective black all over. The
red and white stripes on this one looked garish by comparison. A pilot in
sunglasses to match the rest of Ortega's little gang sat motionless in the cockpit.
The hatch into the belly of the cruiser was already hinged up. Ortega banged on
the hatch coaming as we climbed aboard and the turbines awoke with a whispery
sound.
I helped one of the mohicans manhandle the hatch down, steadied myself against
the lift of the cruiser and found my way to a window seat. As we spiralled up, I
craned my neck to keep the crowd below in sight. The transport straightened out
about a hundred metres up and dropped its nose slightly. I sank back into the
arms of the automould and found Ortega watching me.
'Still curious huh?' she said.
'I feel like a tourist. Answer me a question?'
'If I can.'
'Well, if these guys don't practise birth control, there's got to be an awful lot of
them, right. And Earth isn't exactly a hive of activity these days, so . . . Why
aren't they running things?'
Ortega and her men swapped a set of unpleasant smiles. 'Storage,' said the
mohican on my left.
I slapped myself on the back of the neck, and then wondered if the gesture was
in use here. It's the standard site for a cortical stack, after all, but then cultural
quirks don't always work like that.
'Storage. Of course.' I looked around at their faces. 'There's no special exemption
for them?'
'Nope.' For some reason, this little exchange seemed to have made us all

buddies. They were relaxing. The same mohican went on to elaborate. 'Ten years
or three months, it's all the same to them. A death sentence every time. They
never come off stack. It's cute, huh?'
I nodded. 'Very tidy. What happens to the bodies?'
The man opposite me made a throwaway gesture. 'Sold off, broken down for
transplants. Depends on the family.'
I turned away and stared out of the window.
'Something the matter, Kovacs?'
I faced Ortega with a fresh smile gripping my face. It felt as if I was getting quite
good at them.
'No, no. I was just thinking. It's like a different planet.'
That cracked them up.

Suntoucb House

October 2nd

Takeshi-san,
When you receive this letter, you will doubtless be somewhat disoriented. I offer
my sincere apologies for this, but I have been assured that the training you
underwent with the Envoy Corps should enable you to deal with the situation.
Similarly, I assure you that I would not have subjected you to any of this had my
own situation not been desperate.
My name is Laurens Bancroft. Coming as you do from the colonies, this may not
mean anything to you. Suffice it to say that I am a rich and powerful man here
on Earth, and have made many enemies as a result. Six weeks ago I was
murdered, an act which the police, for reasons of their own, have chosen to
regard as suicide. Since the murderers ultimately failed I can only assume that
they will try again and, in view of the police attitude, they may well succeed.

Clearly you will wonder what all this has to do with you and why you have been
dragged a hundred and eighty-six light years out of storage to deal -with such a
local matter. I have been advised by my lawyers to retain a private investigator,
but owing to my prominence in the global community, I am unable to trust
anyone I could engage locally. I was given your name by Reileen Kawahara, for
whom I understand you did some work on New Beijing eight years ago. The
Envoy Corps were able to locate you in Kanagawa within two days of my
requesting your whereabouts, though in view of your discharge and subsequent
activities they were unable to offer any kind of operational guarantees or
pledges. It is my understanding that you are your own man.
The terms under which you have been released are as follows: You are
contracted to -work for me for a period of six weeks with an option for me to
renew at the end of that time should further work be necessary. During this time
I shall be responsible for all reasonable expenses incurred by your investigation.
In addition, I shall cover the cost of sleeve rental for this period. In the event that
you conclude the investigation successfully, the remainder of your storage
sentence at Kanagawa — one hundred and seventeen years and four months —
will be annulled and you will be refreighted to Harlan 's World for immediate
release in a sleeve of your own choosing. Alternatively, I undertake to pay off the
balance of the mortgage on your current sleeve here on Earth and you may
become a naturalised UN citizen. In either case the sum of one hundred
thousand UN dollars, or equivalent, will be credited to you.
I believe these terms to be generous but I should add that I am not a man to be
trifled with. In the event that your investigation fails and I am killed, or that you
attempt to in any way escape or evade the terms of your contract, the sleeve
lease will be terminated immediately arid you -will be re, turned to storage to
complete your sentence here on Earth. Any further legal penalties that you incur
may be added to that sentence. Should you choose not to accept my contract
from, the outset, you will also be returned to storage immediately, though I
cannot undertake to refreight you to Harlan’s World in this case.
I am hopeful that you will see this arrangement as an opportunity, and agree to
work for me. In anticipation of this, I am sending a driver to collect you from the
storage facility. His name is Curtis and he is one of my most trusted employees.
He will be waiting for you in the release hall.
I look forward to meeting you at Suntouch House.

Yours sincerely,
LaurensJ. Bancroft.

CHAPTER THREE

Suntouch House was aptly named. From Bay City we flew south down the coast
for about half an hour before the change in engine pitch warned me that we were
approaching our destination. By that time the light through the right side
windows was turning warm gold with the sun's decline towards the sea. I peered
out as we started to descend and saw how the waves below were molten copper
and the air above pure amber. It was like landing in a jar of honey.
The transport sideslipped and banked, giving me a view of the Bancroft estate. It
edged in from the sea in neatly manicured tones of green and gravel around a
sprawling tile-roofed mansion big enough to house a small army. The walls were
white, the roofing coral and the army, if it existed, was out of sight. Any security
systems Bancroft had installed were very low-key. As we came lower I made out
the discreet haze of a power fence along one border of the grounds. Barely
enough to distort the view from the house. Nice.
Less than a dozen metres up over one of the immaculate lawns the pilot kicked
in the landing brake with what seemed like unnecessary violence. The transport
shuddered from end to end and we came down hard amidst flying clods of turf.
I shot Ortega a reproachful look which she ignored. She threw open the hatch
and climbed out. After a moment I joined her on the damaged lawn. Prodding at
the torn grass with the toe of one shoe, I shouted over the sound of the turbines.
'What was that all about? You guys pissed off with Bancroft just because he

doesn't buy his own suicide?'
'No.' Ortega surveyed the house in front of us as if she was thinking of moving
in. 'No, that's not why we're pissed off with Mr Bancroft.'
'Care to tell me why?'
'You're the detective.'
A young woman appeared from the side of the house, tennis racket in hand, and
came across the lawn towards us. When she was about twenty metres away, she
stopped, tucked the racket under her arm and cupped her hands to her mouth.
'Are you Kovacs?'
She was beautiful in a sun, sea and sand sort of way and the sports shorts and
leotard she was wearing displayed the fact to maximal effect. Golden hair
brushed her shoulders as she moved and the shout gave away a glimpse of milk
white teeth. She wore sweat bands at forehead and wrists and from the dew on
her brow they were not for show. There was finely toned muscle in her legs and
a substantial bicep stood out when she lifted her arms. Exuberant breasts strained
the fabric of the leotard. I wondered if the body was hers.
'Yes,' I called back. 'Takeshi Kovacs. I was discharged this afternoon.'
'You were supposed to be met at the storage facility.' It was like an accusation. I
spread my hands.
'Well. I was.'
'Not by the police.' She stalked forward, eyes mostly on Ortega. 'You. I know
you.'
'Lieutenant Ortega,' said Ortega, as if she was at a garden party. 'Bay City,
Organic Damage Division.'
'Yes. I remember now.' The tone was distinctly hostile. 'I assume it was you who
arranged for our chauffeur to be pulled over on some trumped-up emissions
charge.'

'No, that would be Traffic Control, ma'am,' said the detective politely. 'I have no
jurisdiction in that division.'
The woman in front of us sneered.
'Oh, I'm sure you haven't, lieutenant. And I'm sure none of your friends work
there either.' The voice turned patronising. 'We'll have him released before the
sun goes down, you know.'
I glanced sideways to see Ortega's reaction, but there was none. The hawk
profile remained impassive. Most of me was preoccupied with the other woman's
sneer. It was an ugly expression, and one that belonged on an altogether older
face.
Back up by the house there were two large men with automatic weapons slung
over their shoulders. They had been standing under the eaves watching since we
arrived, but now they ambled out of the shade and began to make their way in
our direction. From the slight widening of the young woman's eyes I guessed
that she had summoned them on an internal mike. Slick. On Harlan's World
people are still a bit averse to sticking racks of hardware into themselves, but it
looked as if Earth was going to be a different proposition.
'You are not welcome here, lieutenant,' said the young woman in a freezing
voice.
'Just leaving, ma'am,' said Ortega heavily. She clapped me unexpectedly on the
shoulder and headed back to the transport at an easy pace. Halfway there she
suddenly stopped and turned back.
'Here, Kovacs. Almost forgot. You'll need these.'
She dug in her breast pocket and tossed me a small packet. I caught it reflexively
and looked down. Cigarettes.
'Be seeing you.'
She swung herself aboard the transport and slammed the hatch. Through the
glass I saw her looking at me. The transport lifted on full repulse, pulverising the
ground beneath and ripping a furrow across the lawn as it swung west towards
the ocean. We watched it out of sight.

'Charming,' said the woman beside me, largely to herself.
'Mrs Bancroft?'
She swung around. From the look on her face, I wasn't much more welcome here
than Ortega had been. She had seen the lieutenant's gesture of camaraderie and
her lips twitched with disapproval.
'My husband sent a car for you, Mr Kovacs. Why didn't you wait for it?'
I took out Bancroft's letter. 'It says here the car would be waiting for me. It
wasn't.'
She tried to take the letter from me and I lifted it out of her reach. She stood
facing me, flushed, breasts rising and falling distractingly. When they stick a
body in the tank, it goes on producing hormones pretty much the way it would if
you were asleep. I became abruptly aware that I was swinging a hard-on like a
filled fire hose.
'You should have waited.'
Harlan's World, I remembered from somewhere, has gravity at about o.8g. I
suddenly felt unreasonably heavy again. I pushed out a compressed breath.
'Mrs Bancroft, if I'd waited, I'd still be there now. Can we go inside?'
Her eyes widened a little, and I suddenly saw in them how old she really was.
Then she lowered her gaze and summoned composure. When she spoke again,
her voice had softened.
'I'm sorry, Mr Kovacs. I've forgotten my manners. The police, as you see, have
not been sympathetic. It's been very upsetting, and we all still feel a little on
edge. If you can imagine — '
'There's no need to explain.'
'But I am very sorry. I'm not usually like this. None of us are.' She gestured
around as if to say that the two armed guards behind her would ordinarily have
been bearing garlands of flowers. 'Please accept my apologies.'

'Of course.'
'My husband's waiting for you in the seaward lounge. I'll take you to him
immediately.'

The inside of the house was light and airy. A maid met us at the veranda door
and took Mrs Bancroft's tennis racket for her without a word. We went down a
marbled hallway hung with art that, to my untutored eye, looked old. Sketches of
Gagarin and Armstrong, Empathist renderings of Konrad Harlan and Angin
Chandra. At the end of this gallery, set on a plinth, was something like a narrow
tree made out of crumbling red stone. I paused in front of it and Mrs Bancroft
had to backtrack from the left turn she was making.
'Do you like it?' she asked.
'Very much. This is from Mars, isn't: it.'
Her face underwent a change that I caught out of the corner of my eye. She was
reassessing. I turned for a closer look at her face.
'I'm impressed,' she said.
'People often are. Sometimes I do handsprings too.'
She looked at me narrowly. 'Do you really know what this is?'
'Frankly, no. I used to be interested in structural art. I recognise the stone from
pictures, but . . . '
'It's a Songspire.' She reached past me and let her fingers trail down one of the
upright branches. A faint sighing awoke from the thing and a perfume like
cherries and mustard wafted into the air.
'Is it alive?'
'No one knows.' There was a sudden enthusiasm in her tone that I liked her better
for. 'On Mars they grow to be a hundred metres tall, sometimes as wide as this
house at the root. You can hear them singing for kilometres. The perfume carries

as well. From the erosion patterns, we think that most of them are at least ten
thousand years old. This one might only have been around since the founding of
the Roman empire.'
'Must have been expensive. To bring it back to Earth, I mean.'
'Money wasn't an object, Mr Kovacs.' The mask was back in place. Time to
move on.
We made double time down the left-hand corridor, perhaps to make up for our
unscheduled stop. With each step Mrs Bancroft's breasts jiggled under the thin
material of the leotard and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of
the corridor. More Empathist work, Angin Chandra with her slender hand resting
on a thrusting phallus of a rocket. Not much help.
The seaward lounge was built on the end of the house's west wing. Mrs Bancroft
took me into it through an unobtrusive wooden door and the sun hit us in the
eyes as soon as we entered.
'Laurens. This is Mr Kovacs.'
I lifted a hand to shade my eyes and saw that the seaward lounge had an upper
level with sliding glass doors that accessed a balcony. Leaning on the balcony
was a man. He must have heard us come in; come to that, he must have heard the
police cruiser arrive and known what it signified, but still he stayed where he
was, staring out to sea. Coming back from the dead sometimes makes you feel
that way. Or maybe it was just arrogance. Mrs Bancroft nodded me forward and
we went up a set of stairs made from the same wood as the door. For the first
time I noticed that the walls of the room were shelved from top to bottom with
books. The sun was laying an even coat of orange light along their spines.
As we came out onto the balcony, Bancroft turned to face us. There was a book
in his hand, folded closed over his fingers.
'Mr Kovacs.' He transferred the book so that he could shake my hand. 'It's a
pleasure to meet you at last. How do you find the new sleeve?'
'It's fine. Comfortable.'
'Yes, I didn't involve myself too much in the details, but I instructed my lawyers

to find something . . . suitable.' He glanced back, as if looking for Ortega's
cruiser on the horizon. 'I hope the police weren't too officious.'
'Not so far.'
Bancroft looked like a Man Who Read. There's a favourite experia star on
Harlan's World called Alain Marriott, best known for his portrayal of a virile
young Quellist philosopher who cuts a swathe through the brutal tyranny of the
early Settlement years. It's questionable how accurate this portrayal of the
Quellists is, but it's a good flic. I've seen it twice. Bancroft looked a lot like an
older version of Marriott in that role. He was slim and elegant with a full head of
iron grey hair which he wore back in a ponytail, and hard black eyes. The book
in his hand and the shelves around him were like an utterly natural extension of
the powerhouse of a mind that looked out from those eyes.
Bancroft touched his wife on the shoulder with a dismissive casualness that in
my present state made me want to weep.
'It was that woman, again,' said Mrs Bancroft. 'The lieutenant.'
Bancroft nodded. 'Don't worry about it, Miriam. They're just sniffing around. I
warned them I was going to do this, and they ignored me. Well, now Mr Kovacs
is here, and they're finally taking me seriously.'
He turned to me. 'The police have not been very helpful to me over this matter.'
'Yeah. That's why I'm here, apparently.'
We looked at each other while I tried to decide if I was angry with this man or
not. He'd dragged me halfway across the settled universe, dumped me into a new
body and offered me a deal that was weighted so I couldn't refuse. Rich people
do this. They have the power and they see no reason not to use it. Men and
women are just merchandise, like everything else. Store them, freight them,
decant them. Sign at the bottom please.
On the other hand, no one at Suntouch House had mispronounced my name yet,
and I didn't really have a choice. And then there was the money. A hundred
thousand UN was about six or seven times what Sarah and I had expected to
make on the Millsport wetware haul. UN dollars, the hardest currency there was,
negotiable on any world in the Protectorate.

That had to be worth keeping your temper for.
Bancroft gave his wife another casual touch, this time on her waist, pushing her
away.
'Miriam, could you leave us alone for a while. I'm sure Mr Kovacs has endless
questions, and it's likely to be boring for you.'
'Actually, I'm likely to have some questions for Mrs Bancroft as well.'
She was already on her way back inside, and my comment stopped her in midstride. She cocked her head at an angle, and looked from me to Bancroft and
back. Beside me, her husband stirred. This wasn't what he wanted.
'Maybe I could speak to you later,' I amended. 'Separately.'
'Yes, of course.' Her eyes met mine, then danced aside. 'I'll be in the chart room,
Laurens. Send Mr Kovacs along when you've finished.'
We both watched her leave, and when the door closed behind her Bancroft
gestured me to one of the lounge chairs on the balcony. Behind them, an antique
astronomical telescope stood levelled at the horizon, gathering dust. Looking
down at the boards under my feet, I saw they were worn with use. The
impression of age settled over me like a cloak, and I lowered myself into my
chair with a tiny frisson of unease.
'Please don't think of me as a chauvinist, Mr Kovacs. After nearly two hundred
and fifty years of marriage, my relationship with Miriam is more politeness than
anything. It really would be better if you spoke to her alone.'
'I understand.' That was shaving the truth a bit, but it would do.
'Would you care for a drink? Something alcoholic?'
'No thank you. Just some fruit juice, if you have it.' The shakiness associated
with downloading was beginning to assert itself, and in addition there was an
unwelcome scratchiness in my feet and fingers which I assumed was nicotine
dependency. Apart from the odd cigarette bummed from Sarah, I'd been quit for
the last two sleeves and I didn't want to have to break the habit all over again.
Alcohol on top of everything would finish me.

Bancroft folded his hands in his lap. 'Of course. I'll have some brought up. Now,
where would you like to begin?'
'Maybe we should start with your expectations. I don't know what Reileen
Kawahara told you, or what kind of profile the Envoy Corps has here on Earth,
but don't expect miracles from me. I'm not a sorcerer.'
'I'm aware of that. I have read the Corps literature carefully. And all Reileen
Kawahara told me was that you were reliable, if a trifle fastidious.'
I remembered Kawahara's methods, and my reactions to them. Fastidious. Right.
I gave him the standard spiel anyway. It felt funny, pitching for a client who was
already in. Felt funny to play down what I could do, as well. The criminal
community isn't long on modesty, and what you do to get serious backing is
inflate whatever reputation you may already have. This was more like being
back in the Corps. Long polished conference tables and Virginia Vidaura ticking
off the capabilities of her team.
'Envoy training was developed for the UN colonial commando units. That
doesn't mean . . . '
Doesn't mean every Envoy is a commando. No, not exactly, but then what is a
soldier anyway? How much of special forces training is engraved on the physical
body and how much in the mind? And what happens when the two are
separated?
Space, to use a clichй, is big. The closest of the Settled Worlds is fifty light years
out from Earth. The most far-flung four times that distance, and some of the
Colony transports are still going. If some maniac starts rattling tactical nukes, or
some other biosphere-threatening toys, what are you going to do? You can
transmit the information, via hyperspatial needlecast, so close to instantaneously
that scientists are still arguing about the terminology but that, to quote Quellcrist
Falconer, deploys no bloody divisions. Even if you launched a troop carrier the
moment the shit hit the fan, the marines would be arriving just in time to quiz the
grandchildren of whoever won.
That's no way to run a Protectorate.
OK, you can digitise and freight the minds of a crack combat team. It's been a

long time since weight of numbers counted for much in a war, and most of the
military victories of the last half millennium have been won by small, mobile
guerrilla forces. You can even decant your crack d.h.f. soldiers directly into
sleeves with combat conditioning, jacked-up nervous systems and steroid built
bodies. Then what do you do?
They're in bodies they don't know, on a world they don't know, fighting for one
bunch of total strangers against another bunch of total strangers over causes
they've probably never even heard of and certainly don't understand. The climate
is different, the language and culture is different, the wildlife and vegetation is
different, the atmosphere is different. Shit, even the gravity is different. They
know nothing, and even if you download them with implanted local knowledge,
it's a massive amount of information to assimilate at a time when they're likely to
be fighting for their lives within hours of sleeving.
That's where you get the Envoy Corps.
Neurachem conditioning, cyborg interfaces, augmentation — all this stuff is
physical. Most of it doesn't even touch the pure mind, and it's the pure mind that
gets freighted. That's where the Corps started. They took psychospiritual
techniques that oriental cultures on Earth had known about for millennia and
distilled them into a training system so complete that on most worlds graduates
of it were instantly forbidden by law to hold any political or military office.
Not soldiers, no. Not exactly.
'I work by absorption,' I finished. 'Whatever I come into contact with, I soak up,
and I use that to get by.'
Bancroft shifted in his seat. He wasn't used to being lectured. It was time to start.
'Who found your body?'
'My daughter, Naomi.'
He broke off as someone opened the door in the room below. A moment later,
the maid that had attended Miriam Bancroft earlier came up the steps to the
balcony bearing a tray with a visibly chilled decanter and tall glasses. Bancroft
was wired with internal tannoy, like everyone else at Suntouch House it seemed.

The maid set down her tray, poured in machine-like silence and then withdrew
on a short nod from Bancroft. He stared after her blankly for a while.
Back from the dead. It's no joke.
'Naomi,' I prompted him gently.
He blinked. 'Oh. Yes. She barged in here, wanting something. Probably the keys
to one of the limos. I'm an indulgent father, I suppose, and Naomi is my
youngest.'
'How young?'
'Twenty-three.'
'Do you have many children?'
'Yes, I do. Very many.' Bancroft smiled faintly. 'When you have leisure and
wealth, bringing children into the world is a pure joy. I have twenty-seven sons
and thirty-four daughters.'
'Do they live with you?'
'Naomi does, most of the time. The others come and go. Most have families of
their own now.'
'How is Naomi?' I stepped my tone down a little.
Finding your father without his head isn't the best way to start the day.
'She's in psychosurgery,' said Bancroft shortly. 'But she'll pull through. Do you
need to talk to her?'
'Not at the moment.' I got up from the chair and went to the balcony door. 'You
say she barged in here. This is where it happened?'
'Yes.' Bancroft joined me at the door. 'Someone got in here and took my head off
with a particle blaster. You can see the blast mark on the wall down there. Over
by the desk.'
I went inside and down the stairs. The desk was a heavy mirrorwood item —

they must have freighted the gene code from Harlan's World and cultured the
tree here. That struck me as almost as extravagant as the Songspire in the hall,
and in slightly more questionable taste. On the World mirrorwood grows in
forests on three continents, and practically every canal dive in Millsport has a
bar top carved out of the stuff. I moved past it to inspect the stucco wall. The
white surface was furrowed and seared black with the unmistakable signature of
a beam weapon. The burn started at head height and followed a short arc downwards.
Bancroft had remained on the balcony. I looked up at his silhouetted face. 'This
is the only sign of gunfire in the room?'
'Yes.'
'Nothing else was damaged, broken or disturbed in any way?'
'No. Nothing.' It was clear that he wanted to say more, but he was keeping quiet
until I'd finished.
'And the police found the weapon beside you?'-'Yes.'
'Do you own a weapon that would do this?'
'Yes. It was mine. I keep it in a safe under the desk. Handprint coded. They
found the safe open, nothing else removed. Do you want to see inside it?'
'Not at the moment, thank you.' I knew from experience how difficult
mirrorwood furniture is to shift. I turned up one corner of the woven rug under
the desk. There was an almost invisible seam in the floor beneath. 'Whose prints
will open this?'
'Miriam's and my own.'
There was a significant pause. Bancroft sighed, loud enough to carry across the
room. 'Go on, Kovacs. Say it. Everyone else has. Either I committed suicide or
my wife murdered me. There's just no other reasonable explanation. I've been
hearing it since they pulled me out of the tank at Alcatraz.'

I looked elaborately round the room before I met his eyes.
'Well, you'll admit it makes for easier police work,' I said. 'It's nice and neat.'
He snorted, but there was a laugh in it. I found myself beginning to like this man
despite myself. I went back up, stepped out onto the balcony and leaned on the
rail. Outside a black-clad figure prowled back and forth across the lawn below,
weapon slung at port. In the distance the power fence shimmered. I stared in that
direction for a while.
'It's asking a lot to believe that someone got in here, past all the security, broke
into a safe only you and your wife had access to and murdered you, without
causing any disturbance. You're an intelligent man, you must have some reason
for believing it.'
'Oh, I do. Several.'
'Reasons the police chose to ignore.'
'Yes.'
I turned to face him. 'All right. Let's hear it.'
'You're looking at it, Mr Kovacs.' He stood there in front of me. 'I'm here. I'm
back. You can't kill me just by wiping out my cortical stack.'
'You've got remote storage. Obviously, or you wouldn't be here. How regular is
the update?'
Bancroft smiled. 'Every forty-eight hours.' He tapped the back of his neck.
'Direct needlecast from here into a shielded stack over at the PsychaSec
installation at Alcatraz. I don't even have to think about it.'
'And they keep your clones on ice there as well.'
'Yes. Multiple units.'
Guaranteed immortality. I sat there thinking about that for a while, wondering
how I'd like it. Wondering if I'd like it.

'Must be expensive,' I said at last.
'Not really. I own PsychaSec.'
'Oh.'
'So you see, Kovacs, neither I nor my wife could have pulled that trigger. We
both knew it wouldn't be enough to kill me. No matter how unlikely it seems, it
had to be a stranger. Someone who didn't know about the remote.'
I nodded. 'All right, who else did know about It? Let's narrow the field.'
'Apart from my family?' Bancroft shrugged. 'My lawyer, Oumou Prescott. A
couple of her legal aides. The director at PsychaSec. That's about it.'
'Of course,' I said, 'suicide is rarely a rational act.'
'Yes, that's what the police said. They used it to explain all the other minor
inconveniences in their theory as well.'
'Which were?'
This was what Bancroft had wanted to reveal earlier. It came out in a rush.
'Which were that I should choose to walk the last two kilometres home, and let
myself into the grounds on foot, then apparently readjust my internal clock
before I killed myself.'
I blinked. 'I'm sorry?'
'The police found traces of a cruiser landing in a field two kilometres from the
perimeter of Suntouch House, which conveniently enough is just outside the
pick-up range of the house security surveillance. Equally conveniently, there was
apparently no satellite cover overhead at that precise time.'
'Did they check taxi datastacks?'
Bancroft nodded. 'For what it's worth, they did, yes. West Coast law does not
require taxi companies to keep records of their fleets' whereabouts at any given
time. Some of the more reputable firms do, of course, but there are others that
don't. Some even make a selling point of it. Client confidentiality, that sort of

thing.' A momentary hunted look crossed Bancroft's face. 'For some clients, in
some cases, that would be a distinct advantage.'
'Have you used these firms in the past?'
'On occasion, yes.'
The logical next question hung in the air between us. I left it unasked, and
waited. If Bancroft wasn't going to share his reasons for wanting confidential
transport, I wasn't going to press him until I had a few other landmarks locked
down.
Bancroft cleared his throat. 'There is, in any case, some evidence to suggest that:
the vehicle in question might not have been a taxi. Field effect distribution, the
police say. A pattern more in keeping with a larger vehicle.'
'That depends on how hard it landed.'
'I know. In any case, my tracks lead from the landing site, and apparently the
condition of my shoes was in keeping with a two-kilometre trek across country.
And then, finally, there was a call placed from this room shortly after three a.m.
the night I was killed. A time check. There's no voice on the line, only the sound
of someone breathing.'
'And the police know this too?'
'Of course they do.'
'How did they explain it?'
Bancroft smiled thinly. 'They didn't. They thought the solitary walk through the
rain was very much in keeping with the act of suicide, and apparently they
couldn't see any inconsistency in a man wanting to check his internal chronochip
before he blows his own head off. As you say, suicide is not a rational act. They
have case histories of this sort of thing. Apparently, the world is full of
incompetents who kill themselves and wake up in a new sleeve the next day. I've
had it explained to me. They forget they're wearing a stack, or it doesn't seem
important at the moment of the act. Our beloved medical welfare system brings
them right back, suicide notes and requests notwithstanding. Curious abuse of
rights, that. Is it the same system on Harlan's World?'

I shrugged. 'More or less. If the request is legally witnessed, then they have to let
them go. Otherwise, failure to revive is a storage offence.'
'I suppose that's a wise precaution.'
'Yes. It stops murderers passing their work off as suicide.'
Bancroft leaned forward on the rail and locked gazes with me. 'Mr Kovacs, I am
three hundred and fifty-seven years old. I have lived through a corporate war, the
subsequent collapse of my industrial and trading interests, the real deaths of two
of my children, at least three major economic crises, and I am still here. I am not
the kind of man to take my own life, and even if I were, I would not have
bungled it in this fashion. If it had been my intention to die, you would not be
talking to me now. Is that clear?'
I looked back at him, back at those hard dark eyes. 'Yes. Very clear.'
'That's good.' He unpinned his stare. 'Shall we continue?'
'Yes. The police. They don't like you very much, do they?'
Bancroft smiled without much humour. 'The police and I have a perspective
problem.'
'Perspective?'
'That's right.' He moved along the balcony. 'Come here, I'll show you what I
mean.'
I followed him along the rail, catching the telescope with my arm as I did and
knocking the barrel upright. The download shakes were beginning to demand
their dues. The telescope's positional motor whined crabbily and returned the
instrument to its original shallow angle. Elevation and range focus ticked over
on the ancient digital memory display. I paused to watch the thing realign itself.
The fingermarks on the keypad were smudged in years of dust.
Bancroft had either not noticed my ineptitude or was being polite about it.
'Yours?' I asked him, jerking a thumb at the instrument. He glanced at it absently.

'Once. It was an enthusiasm I had. Back when the stars were still something to
stare at. You wouldn't remember how that felt.' It was said without conscious
pretension or arrogance, almost inconsequentially. His voice lost some of its
focus, like a transmission fading out. 'Last time I looked through that lens was
nearly two centuries ago. A lot of the Colony ships were still in flight then. We
were still waiting to find out if they'd make it. Waiting for the needlebeams to
come back to us. Like lighthouse beacons.'
He was losing me. I brought him back to reality. 'Perspective?' I reminded him
gently.
'Perspective.' He nodded and swung an arm out over his property. 'You see that
tree. Just beyond the tennis courts.'
I could hardly miss it. A gnarled old monster taller than the house, casting shade
over an area the size of a tennis court in itself. I nodded.
'That tree is over seven hundred years old. When I bought this property, I hired a
design engineer and he wanted to chop it down. He was planning to build the
house further up the rise and the tree was spoiling the sea view. I sacked him.'
Bancroft turned to make sure his point was getting across.
'You see, Mr Kovacs, that engineer was a man in his thirties, and to him the tree
was just an inconvenience. It was in his way. The fact it had been part of the
world for over twenty times the length of his own life didn't seem to bother him.
He had no respect.'
'So you're the tree.'
'Just so,' said Bancroft equably. 'I am the tree. The police would like to chop me
down, just like that engineer. I am inconvenient to them, and they have no
respect.'
I went back to my seat to chew this over. Kristin Ortega's attitude was beginning
to make some sense at last. If Bancroft thought he was outside the normal
requirements of good citizenship, he wasn't likely to make many friends in
uniform. There would have been little point trying to explain to him that for
Ortega there was another tree called the Law and that in her eyes he was banging
a few profane nails into it himself. I've seen this kind of thing from both sides,

and there just isn't any solution except to do what my own ancestors had done.
When you don't like the laws, you go somewhere they can't touch you.
And then you make up some of your own.
Bancroft stayed at the rail. Perhaps he was communing with the tree. I decided to
shelve this line of inquiry for a while.
'What's the last thing you remember?'
'Tuesday 14th August,' he said promptly. 'Going to bed at about midnight.'
'That was the last remote update.'
'Yes, the needlecast would have gone through about four in the morning, but
obviously I was asleep by then.'
'So almost a full forty-eight hours before your death.'
'I'm afraid so.'
Optimally bad. In forty-eight hours, almost anything can happen. Bancroft could
have been to the moon and back in that time. I rubbed at the scar under my eye
again, wondering absently how it had got there.
'And there's nothing before that time that could suggest to you why someone
might want to kill you.'
Bancroft was still leaning on the rail, looking out, but I saw how he smiled.
'Did I say something amusing?'
He had the grace to come back to his seat.
'No, Mr Kovacs. There is nothing amusing about this situation. Someone out
there wants me dead, and that's not a comfortable feeling. But you must
understand that for a man in my position enmity and even death threats are part
and parcel of everyday existence. People envy me, people hate me. It is the price
of success.'
This was news to me. People hate me on a dozen different worlds and I've never

considered myself a successful man.
'Had any interesting ones recently? Death threats, I mean.'
He shrugged. 'Perhaps. I don't make a habit of screening them. Ms Prescott
handles that for me.'
'You don't consider death threats worth your attention?'
'Mr Kovacs, I am an entrepreneur. Opportunities arise, crises present themselves,
and I deal with them. Life goes on. I hire managers to deal with that.
'Very convenient for you. But in view of the circumstances, I find it hard to
believe neither you nor the police have consulted Ms Prescott's files.'
Bancroft waved a hand. 'Of course, the police conducted their own cursory
inquiry. Oumou Prescott told them exactly what she had already told me. That
nothing out of the ordinary had been received in the last six months. I have
enough faith in her not to need to check beyond that. You'll probably want to
look at the files yourself, though.'
The thought of scrolling through hundreds of metres of incoherent vitriol from
the lost and losers of this antique world was quite sufficient to uncap my
weariness again. A profound lack of interest in Bancroft's problems washed
through me. I mastered it with an effort worthy of Virginia Vidaura's approval.
'Well, I'll certainly need to talk to Ournou Prescott, anyway.'
'I'll make the appointment immediately.' Bancroft's eyes took on the inward glaze
of someone consulting internal hardware. What time would suit you?'
I held up a hand. 'Probably better if I do that myself. Just let her know I'll be in
touch. And I'll need to see the re-sleeving facility at PsychaSec.'
'Certainly. In fact, I'll get Prescott to take you there. She knows the director.
Anything else?'
'A line of credit.'
'Of course. My bank have already allocated a DNA-coded account to you. I

understand they have the same system on Harlan’s World.'
I licked my thumb and held it up queryingly. Bancroft nodded.
'Just the same here. You will find there are areas of Bay City where cash is still
the only negotiable currency. Hopefully you won't have to spend much time in
those parts, but if you do you can draw actual currency against your account at
any bank outlet. Will you require a weapon?'
'Not at the moment, no.' One of Virginia Vidaura's cardinal rules had always
been find out the nature of your task before you choose your tools. That single
sweep of charred stucco on Bancroft's wall looked too elegant for this to be a
shoot 'em up carnival.
'Well.' Bancroft seemed almost perplexed by my response. He had been on the
point of reaching into his shirt pocket, and now he completed the action,
awkwardly. He held out an inscribed card to me. 'This is my gunmaker. I've told
them to expect you.'
I took the card and looked at it. The ornate script read Larkin & Green —
Armourers since 2203. Quaint. Below was a single string of numbers. I pocketed
the card.
'This might be useful later on,' I admitted. 'But for the moment I want to make a
soft landing. Sit back arid wait for the dust to settle. I think you can appreciate
the need for that.'
'Yes, of course. Whatever you think best. I trust your judgement.' Bancroft
caught my gaze and held it. 'You'll bear in mind the terms of our agreement,
though. 'I am paying for a service. I don't react well to abuse of trust, Mr
Kovacs.'
'No, I don't suppose you do,' I said tiredly. I remembered the way Reileen
Kawahara had dealt with two unfaithful minions. The animal sounds they had
made came back to me in dreams for a long time afterwards. Reileen's argument,
framed as she peeled an apple against the backdrop of those screams, was that
since no one really dies any more, punishment can only come through suffering.
I felt my new face twitch, even now, with the memory. 'For what it's worth, the
line the Corps fed you about me is so much shit on a prick. My word's as good as
it ever was.'

I stood up.
'Can you recommend a place to stay back in the city. Somewhere quiet, mid
range.'
'Yes, there are places like that on Mission Street. I'll have someone ferry you
back there. Curtis, if he's out of arrest by then.' Bancroft climbed to his feet as
well. 'I take it you intend to interview Miriam now. She really knows more about
those last forty-eight hours than I do, so you'll want to speak to her quite closely.'
I thought about those ancient eyes in that pneumatic teenager's body and the idea
of carrying on a conversation with Miriam Bancroft was suddenly repellent. At
the same time a cold hand strummed taut chords in the pit of my stomach and the
head of my penis swelled abruptly with blood. Classy.
'Oh, yes,' I said unenthusiastically. 'I'd like to do that.'

CHAPTER FOUR

'You seem ill at ease, Mr Kovacs. Are you?'
I looked over my shoulder at the maid who had shown me in, then back at
Miriam Bancroft. Their bodies were about the same age.
'No,' I said, more coarsely than I'd intended.
She briefly curved her mouth down at the corners and went back to rolling up
the map she'd been studying when I arrived. Behind me the maid pulled the chart
room door closed with a heavy click. Bancroft hadn't seen fit to accompany me
into the presence of his wife. Perhaps one encounter a day was as much as they
allowed themselves. Instead, the maid had appeared as if by magic as we came
down from the balcony in the seaward lounge. Bancroft paid her about as much
attention as he had last time.
When I left, he was standing by the mirrorwood desk, staring at the blast mark
on the wall.
Mrs Bancroft deftly tightened the roll on the map in her hands and began to slide
it into a long protective tube.
'Well,' she said, without looking up. 'Ask me your questions, then.'
'Where were you when it happened?'

'I was in bed.' She looked up at me this time. 'Please don't ask me to corroborate
that; I was alone.'
The chart room was long and airy under an arched roof that someone had tiled
with illuminum. The map racks were waist high, each topped with a glassed-in
display and set out in rows like exhibit cases in a museum. I moved out of the
centre aisle, putting one of the racks between Mrs Bancroft and myself. It felt a
little like taking cover.
'Mrs Bancroft, you seem to be under some misapprehension here. I'm not the
police. I'm interested in information, not guilt.'
She slid the wrapped map into its holder and leaned back against the rack with
both hands behind her. She had left her fresh young sweat and tennis clothes in
some elegant bathroom while I was talking to her husband. Now she was
immaculately fastened up in black slacks and something born of a union between
a dinner jacket and a bodice. Her sleeves were pushed casually up almost to the
elbow, her wrists unadorned with jewellery.
'Do I sound guilty, Mr Kovacs?' she asked me.
'You seem overanxious to assert your fidelity to a complete stranger.'
She laughed. It was a pleasant, throaty sound and her shoulders rose and fell as
she let it out. A laugh I could get to like.
'How very indirect you are.'
I looked down at the map displayed on the top of the rack in front of me. It was
dated in the top left-hand corner, a year four centuries before I was born. The
names marked on it were in a script I couldn't read
'Where I come from, directness is not considered a great virtue, Mrs Bancroft.'
'No? Then what is?'
I shrugged. 'Politeness. Control. Avoidance of embarrassment for all parties.'
'Sounds boring. I think you're going to have a few shocks here, Mr Kovacs.'

'I didn't say I was a good citizen where I come from, Mrs Bancroft.'
'Oh.' She pushed herself off the rack and moved towards me. 'Yes, Laurens told
me a little about you. It seems you're thought of as a dangerous man on Harlan's
World.'
I shrugged again.
'It's Russian.'
'I'm sorry?'
'The script.' She came round the rack and stood beside me, looking down at the
map. 'This is a Russian computer-generated chart of moon landing sites. Very
rare. I got it at auction. Do you like it?'
'It's very nice. What time did you go to sleep the night your husband was shot?'
She stared at me. 'Early. I told you, I was alone.' She forced the edge out of her
voice and her tone became almost light again. 'Oh, and if that sounds like guilt,
Mr Kovacs, it's not. It's resignation. With a twist of bitterness.'
'You feel bitter about your husband?'
She smiled. 'I thought I said resigned.'
'You said both.'
'Are you saying you think I killed my husband?'
'I don't think anything yet. But it is a possibility.'
'Is it?'
'You had access to the safe. You were inside the house defences when it
happened. And now it sounds as if you might have some emotional motives.'
Still smiling, she said, 'Building a case, are we, Mr Kovacs?'
I looked back at her. 'If the heart pumps. Yeah.'

'The police had a similar theory for a while. They decided the heart didn't pump.
I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke in here.'
I looked down at my hands and found they had quite unconsciously taken out
Kristin Ortega's cigarettes. I was in the middle of tapping one out of the pack.
Nerves. Feeling oddly betrayed by my new sleeve, I put the packet away.
'I'm sorry.'
'Don't be. It's a question of climate control. A lot of the maps in here are very
sensitive to pollution. You couldn't know.'
She somehow managed to make it sound as if only a complete moron wouldn't
have realised. I could feel my grip on the interview sliding out of sight.
'What made the police — '
'Ask them.' She turned her back and walked away from me as if making a
decision. 'How old are you, Mr Kovacs?'
'Subjectively? Forty-one. The years on Harlan's World are a little longer than
here, but there isn't much in it.'
'And objectively?' she asked, mocking my tone.
'I've had about a century in the tank. You tend to lose track.' That was a lie. I
knew to the day how long each of my terms in storage had been. I'd worked it
out one night and now the number wouldn't go away. Every time I went down
again, I added on.
'How alone you must be by now.'
I sighed and turned to examine the nearest map rack. Each rolled chart was
labelled at the end. The notation was archaeological. Syrtis Minor; 3rd
excavation, east quarter. Bradbury; aboriginal ruins. I started to tug one of the
rolls free.
'Mrs Bancroft, how I feel is not at issue here. Can you think of any reason why
your husband might have tried to kill himself?'

She whirled on me almost before I had finished speaking and her face was tight
with anger.
'My husband did not kill himself,' she said freezingly.
'You seem very sure of that.' I looked up from the map and gave her a smile. 'For
someone who wasn't awake, I mean.'
'Put that back,' she cried, starting towards me. 'You have no idea how valuable
—'
She stopped, brought up short as I slid the map back into the rack. She
swallowed and brought the flush in her cheeks under control.
'Are you trying to make me angry, Air Kovacs?'
'I'm just trying to get some attention.'
We looked at each other for a pair of seconds. Mrs Bancroft lowered her gaze.
'I've told you, I was asleep when it happened. What else can I tell you?'
'Where had your husband gone that night?'
She bit her lip. 'I'm not sure. He went to Osaka that day, for a meeting.'
'Osaka is where?'
She looked at me in surprise
'I'm not from here,' I said patiently.
'Osaka's in Japan. I thought — '
'Yeah, Harlan's World was settled by a Japanese keiretsu using East European
labour. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't around.'
'I'm sorry.'
'Don't be. You probably don't know much about what your ancestors were doing
three centuries ago either.'

I stopped. Mrs Bancroft was looking at me strangely. My own words hit me a
moment later. Download dues. I was going to have to sleep soon, before I said or
did something really stupid.
'I am over three centuries old, Mr Kovacs.' There was a small smile playing
around her mouth as she said it. She'd taken back the advantage as smoothly as a
bottleback diving. 'Appearances are deceptive. This is my eleventh body.'
The way she held herself said that I was supposed to take a look. I flickered my
gaze across the Slavic boned cheeks, down to the dйcolletage and then to the tilt
of her hips, the half shrouded lines of her thighs, all the time affecting a
detachment that neither I nor my recently roused sleeve had any right to.
'It's very nice. A little young for my tastes, but as I said, I'm not from here. Can
we get back to your husband please. He'd been to Osaka during the day, but he
came back. I assume he didn't go physically.'
'No, of course not. He has a transit clone on ice there. He was due back about six
that evening, but — '
'Yes?'
She shifted her posture slightly, and opened a palm at me. I got the impression
she was forcibly composing herself. 'Well, he was late coming back. Laurens
often stays out late after closing a deal.'
'And no one has any idea where he went on this occasion? Curtis, for example?'
The strain on her face was still there, like weathered rocks under a thin mantle of
snow. 'He didn't send for Curtis. I assume he took a taxi from the sleeving
station. I'm not his keeper, Mr Kovacs.'
'This meeting was crucial? The one in Osaka?'
'Oh . . . no, I don't think so. We've talked about it. Of course, he doesn't
remember, but we've been over the contracts and it's something he'd had
timetabled for a while. A marine development company called Pacificon, based
in Japan. Leasing renewal, that kind of thing. It's usually all taken care of here in
Bay City, but there was some call for an extraordinary assessors' meeting, and
it's always best to handle that sort of thing close to source.'

I nodded sagely, having no idea what a marine development assessor was.
Noting Mrs Bancroft's strain seemed to be receding.
'Routine stuff, huh?'
'I would think so, yes.' She gave me a weary smile. 'Mr Kovacs, I'm sure the
police have transcripts of this kind of information.'
'I'm sure they do as well, Mrs Bancroft. But there's no reason why they should
share them with me. I have no jurisdiction here.'
'You seemed friendly enough with them when you arrived.' There was a sudden
spike of malice in her voice. I looked steadily at her until she dropped her gaze.
'Anyway, I'm sure Laurens can get you anything you need.'
This was going nowhere fast. I backed up.
'Perhaps I'd better speak to him about that.' I looked around the chart room. 'All
these maps. How long have you been collecting?'
Mrs Bancroft must have sensed that the interview was drawing to a close,
because the tension puddled out of her like oil from a cracked sump.
'Most of my life,' she said. 'While Laurens was staring at the stars, some of us
kept our eyes on the ground.'
For some reason I thought of the telescope abandoned on Bancroft's sundeck. I
saw it stranded in angular silhouette against the evening sky, a mute testimony to
times and obsessions past and a relic no one wanted. I remembered the way it
had wheezed back into alignment after I jarred it, faithful to programming
maybe centuries old, briefly awakened the way Miriam Bancroft had stroked the
Songspire awake in the hall.
Old.
With sudden and suffocating pressure, it was all around me, the reek of it
pouring off the stones of Suntouch House like damp. Age. I even caught the waft
of it from the impossibly young and beautiful woman in front of me and my
throat locked up with a tiny click. Something in me wanted to nm, to get out and
breathe fresh, new air, to be away from these creatures whose memories

stretched back beyond every historical event I had been taught in school.
'Are you all right, Mr Kovacs?'
Download dues.
I focused with an effort. 'Yes, I'm fine.' I cleared my throat and looked into her
eyes. 'Well, I won't keep you any longer, Mrs Bancroft. Thank you for your
time.'
She moved towards me. 'Would you like —
'No, it's quite all right. I'll see myself out.'
The walk out of the chart room seemed to take forever, and my footsteps had
developed a sudden echo inside my skull. With every step, and with every
displayed map that I passed I felt those ancient eyes on my spine, watching.
I badly needed a cigarette.

CHAPTER FIVE

The sky was the texture of old silver and the lights were coming on across Bay
City by the time Bancroft's chauffeur got me back to town. We spiralled in from
the sea over an ancient suspension bridge the colour of rust, and in amongst the
heaped-up buildings of a peninsula hill at more than advisable speed. Curtis the
chauffeur was still smarting from his summary detainment by the police. He'd
only been out of arrest a couple of hours when Bancroft asked him to run me
back, and he'd been sullen and uncommunicative on the journey. He was a
muscular young man whose boyish good looks lent themselves well to brooding.
My guess was that employees of Laurens Bancroft were unused to government
minions interrupting their duties.
I didn't complain. My own mood wasn't far off matching the chauffeur's. Images
of Sarah's death kept creeping into my mind. It had only happened last night.
Subjectively.
We braked in the sky over a wide thoroughfare, sharply enough for someone
above us to broadcast an outraged proximity squawk into the limousine's comset.
Curtis cut off the signal with a slap of one hand across the console and his face
tilted up to glower dangerously through the roof window. We settled down into
the flow of ground traffic with a slight bump and immediately made a left into a
narrower street. I started to take an interest in what was outside.
There's a sameness to streetlife. On every world I've ever been, the same

underlying patterns play out, flaunt and vaunt, buy and sell, like some distilled
essence of human behaviour seeping out from under whatever clanking political
machine has been dropped on it from above. Bay City, Earth, most ancient of
civilised worlds, had won itself no exemptions. From the massive insubstantial
holofronts along the antique buildings to the street traders with their catalogue
broadcast sets nestling on shoulders like clumsy mechanical hawks or outsize
tumours, everyone was selling something. Cars pulled in and out from the
kerbside and supple bodies braced against them, leaning in to negotiate the way
they've probably been doing as long as there've been cars to do it against. Shreds
of steam and smoke drifted from food barrows. The limo was sound-and
broadcast-proofed, but you could sense the noises through the glass, corner-pitch
sales chants and modulated music carrying consumer-urge subsonics.
In the Envoy Corps, they reverse humanity. You see the sameness first, the
underlying resonance that lets you get a handle on where you are, then you build
up difference from the details.
The Harlan's World ethnic mix is primarily Slavic and Japanese, although you
can get any variant tank-grown at a price. Here, every face was a different cast
and colour — I saw tall, angular-boned Africans, Mongols, pasty-skinned
Nordics and, once, a girl that looked like Virginia Vidaura, but I lost her in the
crowd. They all slid by like natives on the banks of a river.
Clumsy.
The impression skipped and flickered across my thoughts like the girl in the
crowd. I frowned and caught at it.
On Harlan's World, streetlife has a stripped-back elegance to it, an economy of
motion and gesture that feels almost like choreography if you're not used to it. I
grew up with it, so the effect doesn't register until it's not there any more.
I wasn't seeing it here. The ebb and flow of human commerce beyond the limo's
windows had a quality like choppy water in the space between boats. People
pushed and shoved their way along, backing up abruptly to get round tighter
knots in the crowd that they apparently hadn't noticed until it was too late to
manoeuvre. Obvious tensions broke out, necks craned, muscled bodies drew
themselves up. Twice I saw the makings of a fight take stumbling shape, only to
be swept away on the chop. It was as if the whole place had been sprayed with

some pheromonal irritant
'Curtis.' I glanced sideways at his impassive profile. 'You want to cut the
broadcast block for a minute?'
He looked across at me with a slight curl of the lip. 'Sure.'
I settled back in the seat and fixed my eyes on the street again. 'I'm not a tourist,
Curtis. This is what I do for a living.'
The street sellers' catalogues came aboard like a swarm of delirium-induced
hallucinations, slightly diffuse through lack of directed broadcast and blurring
swiftly into each other as we glided along, but still an overload by any Harlanite
standards. The pimps were the most obvious; a succession of oral and anal acts,
digitally retouched to lend an airbrushed sheen to breasts and musculature. Each
whore's name was murmured in throaty voiceover, along with a superimposed
facial: coy little girls, dominatrixes, stubbled stallions and a few from cultural
stock that was completely alien to me. Weaving in between were the more subtle
chemical lists and surreal scenarios of the drug and implant traders. I caught; a
couple of religious 'casts amidst it all, images of spiritual calm among
mountains, but they were like drowning men in the sea of product.
The stumbling started to make sense.
'What does from the Houses mean?' I asked Curtis, trawling the phrase from the
'casts for the third time.
Curtis sneered. 'The mark of quality. The Houses are a cartel; high-class,
expensive whorehouses up and down the coast. Get you anything you want, they
say. If a girl's from the Houses, she's been taught to do stuff most people only
ever dream about.' He nodded at the street. 'Don't kid yourself, no one out there
ever worked in the Houses.'
'And Stiff?'
He shrugged. 'Street name. Betathanatine. Kids use it for near death experiences.
Cheaper than suicide.'
'I guess.'

'You don't get 'thanatine on Harlan's World?'
'No.' I'd used it offworld with the Corps a couple of times, but there was a ban in
fashion back home. 'We got suicide, though. You want to put the screen back up.'
The soft brush of images cut out abruptly, leaving the inside of my head feeling
stark, like an unfurnished room. I waited for the feeling to fade and, like most
after-effects, it did.
'This is Mission Street,' said Curtis. 'The next couple of blocks are all hotels. You
want me to drop you here?'
'You recommend anywhere?'
'Depends what you want.'
I gave him one of his own shrugs back. 'Light. Space. Room service.'
He squinted thoughtfully. 'Try the Hendrix, if you like. They got a tower annexe,
and the whores they use are clean.' The limousine picked up speed fractionally
and we made a couple of blocks in silence. I neglected to explain I hadn't meant
that kind of room service. Let Curtis draw the conclusions he seemed to want to.
Unbidden, a freeze frame of Miriam Bancroft's sweat-dewed cleavage bounced
through my mind.
The limo coasted to a halt outside a well-lit facade in a style I didn't recognise. I
climbed out and stared up at a huge holocast black man, features screwed up
presumably in ecstasy at the music he was wringing left-handed from a white
guitar. The image had the slightly artificial edges of a remastered twodimensional image, which made it old. Hoping this might indicate a tradition of
service and not just decrepitude, I thanked Curtis, slammed the door and
watched the limousine cruise away. It began to climb almost immediately and
after a moment I lost the tail lights in the streams of airborne traffic. I turned to
the mirrored glass doors behind me and they parted slightly jerkily to let me in.
If the lobby was anything to go by, the Hendrix was certainly going to satisfy the
second of my requirements. Curtis could have parked three or four of Bancroft's
limos side by side in it and still have had space to wheel a cleaning robot round
them. I wasn't so sure about the first. The walls and ceiling bore an irregular

spacing of illuminum tiles whose half-life was clearly almost up, and their feeble
radiance had the sole effect of shovelling the gloom into the centre of the room.
The street I'd just come in off was the strongest source of light in the place.
The lobby was deserted, but there was a faint blue glow coming from a counter
on the far wall. I picked my way towards it, past low armchairs and shin-hungry
metal-edged tables, and found a recessed monitor screen swarming with the
random snow of disconnection. In one corner, a command pulsed on and off in
English, Spanish and Kanji characters:
SPEAK.
I looked around and back at the screen.
No one.
I cleared my throat.
The characters blurred and shifted: ELECT LANGUAGE.
'I'm looking for a room,' I tried, in Japanese out of pure curiosity.
The screen jumped into life so dramatically that I took a step backwards. From
whirling, multi-coloured fragments it rapidly assembled a tanned Asian face
above a dark collar and tie. The face smiled and changed into a Caucasian
female, aged fractionally, and I was facing a blonde thirty-year-old woman in a
sober business suit. Having generated my interpersonal ideal, the hotel also
decided that I couldn't speak Japanese after all.
'Good day, sir. Welcome to the Hotel Hendrix, established 2087 and still here
today. How may we serve you?'
I repeated my request, following the move into Amanglic.
'Thank you, sir. We have a number of rooms, all fully cabled to the city's
information and entertainment stack. Please indicate your preference for floor
and size.'
'I'd like a tower room, west facing. The biggest you've got.'

The face recoiled into a corner inset and a three-dimensional skeleton of the
hotel's room structure etched itself into place. A selector pulsed efficiently
through the rooms and stopped in one corner, then blew up and rotated the room
in question. A column of fine print data shuttered down on one side of the
screen.
'The Watchtower suite, three rooms, dormitory thirteen point eight seven metres
by —
'That's fine, I'll take it.'
The three-dimensional map disappeared like a conjuror's trick and the woman
leapt back to full screen.
'How many nights will you be with us, sir?'
'Indefinite.'
'A deposit is required,' said the hotel diffidently, 'For stays of more than fourteen
days the sum of six hundred dollars UN should be deposited now. In the event of
departure before said fourteen days, a proportion of this deposit will be
refunded.'
'Fine.'
'Thank you sir.' From the tone of voice, I began to suspect that paying customers
were a novelty at the Hotel Hendrix. 'How will you be paying?'
'DNA trace. First Colony Bank of California.'
The payment details were scrolling out when I felt a cold circle of metal touch
the base of my skull.
'That's exactly what you think it is,' said a calm voice. 'You do the wrong thing,
and the cops are going to be picking bits of your cortical stack out of that wall
for weeks. I'm talking about real death, friend. Now, lift your hands away from
your body.'
I complied, feeling an unaccustomed chill shoot up my spine to the point the gun
muzzle was touching. It was a while since I'd been threatened with real death.

'That's good,' said the same calm voice. 'Now, my associate here is going to pat
you down. You let her do that, and no sudden moves.'
'Please key your DNA signature onto the pad beside this screen.' The hotel had
accessed First Colony's database. I waited impassively while a slim, black-clad
woman in a ski mask stepped around and ran a purring grey scanner over me
from head to foot. The gun at my neck never wavered. It was no longer cold. My
flesh had warmed it to a more intimate temperature.
'He's clean.' Another crisp, professional voice. 'Basic neurachem, but it's
inoperative. No hardware.'
'Really? Travelling kind of light, aren't you Kovacs?'
My heart dropped out of my chest and landed soggily in my guts. I'd hoped this
was just local crime.
'I don't know you,' I said cautiously, turning my head a couple of millimetres.
The gun jabbed and I stopped.
'That's right, you don't. Now, here's what's going to happen. We're going to walk
outside —
'Credit access will cease in thirty seconds,' said the hotel patiently. 'Please key in
your DNA signature now.'
'Mr Kovacs won't be needing his reservation,' said the man behind me, putting a
hand on my shoulder. 'Come on, Kovacs, we're going for a ride.'
'I cannot assume host prerogatives without payment,' said the woman on the
screen.
Something in the tone of that phrase stopped me as I was turning, and on
impulse I forced out a sudden, racking cough.
'What — '
Bending forward with the force of the cough, I raised a hand to my mouth and
licked my thumb.

'The fuck are you playing at, Kovacs?'
I straightened again and snapped my hand out to the keypad beside the screen.
Traces of fresh spittle smeared over the matt black receiver. A split second later a
calloused palm edge cracked into the left side of my skull and I collapsed to my
hands and knees on the floor. A boot lashed into my face and I went the rest of
the way down.
'Thank you sir.' I heard the voice of the hotel through a roaring in my head. 'Your
account is being processed.'
I tried to get up and got a second boot in the ribs for the trouble. Blood dripped
from my nose onto the carpet. The barrel of the gun ground into my neck.
'That wasn't smart, Kovacs.' The voice was marginally less calm. 'If you think
the cops are going to trace us where you're going, then the stack must have
fucked your brain. Now get up!'
He was pulling me to my feet when the thunder cut loose.
Why someone had seen fit to equip the Hendrix's security systems with twentymillimetre automatic cannon was beyond me, but they did the job with
devastating totality. Out of the corner of one eye I glimpsed the twin-mounted
autoturret come snaking down from the ceiling just a moment before it
channelled a three-second burst of fire through my primary assailant. Enough
firepower to bring down a small aircraft. The noise was deafening.
The masked woman ran for the doors, and with the echoes of fire still
hammering-in my ears I saw the turret swivel to follow. She made about a dozen
paces through the gloom before a prism of ruby laser light dappled across her
back and a fresh fusillade exploded in the confines of the lobby. I clapped both
hands over my ears, still on my knees, and the shells punched through her. She
went over in a graceless tangle of limbs.
The firing stopped.
In the cordite reeking quiet that followed, nothing moved. The autoturret had
gone dormant, barrels slanting at a downward angle, smoke coiling from the
breeches. I unclasped my hands from my ears and climbed to my feet, pressing
gingerly on my nose and face to ascertain the extent of the damage done. The

bleeding seemed to be slowing down and though there were cuts in my mouth I
couldn't find any loosened teeth. My ribs hurt where the second kick had hit me,
but it didn't feel as if anything was broken. I glanced over at the nearest corpse,
and wished I hadn't. Someone was going to have to get a mop.
To my left an elevator door opened with a faint chime.
'Your room is ready, sir,' said the hotel.

CHAPTER SIX

Kristin Ortega was remarkably restrained.
She came through the hotel doors with a loping stride that bounced one heavily
weighted jacket pocket against her thigh, came to a halt in the centre of the lobby
and surveyed the carnage with her tongue thrust into one cheek.
'You do this sort of thing a lot, Kovacs?'
'I've been waiting a while,' I told her mildly. 'I'm not in a great mood.'
The hotel had placed a call to the Bay City police about the time the autoturret
had cut loose, but it was a good half hour before the first cruisers came spiralling
down out of the sky traffic. I hadn't bothered to go to my room, since I knew
they were going to drag me out of bed anyway, and once they arrived there was
no question of me going anywhere until Ortega got there. A police medic gave
me a cursory check, ascertained that I wasn't suffering from concussion and left
me with a retardant spray to stop the nose bleed, after which I sat in the lobby
and let my new sleeve smoke some of the lieutenant's cigarettes. I was still
sitting there an hour later when she arrived.
Ortega gestured. 'Yeah, well. Busy city at night.'
I offered her the packet. She looked at it as if I'd just posed a major philosophical
question, then took it and shook out a cigarette. Ignoring the ignition patch on

the side of the packet, she searched her pockets, produced a heavy petrol lighter
and snapped it open. She seemed to be on autopilot, moving aside almost
without noticing to let a forensics team bring in new equipment, then returning
the lighter to a different pocket. Around us, the lobby seemed suddenly crowded
with efficient people doing their jobs.
'So.' She plumed smoke into the air above her head. 'You know these guys?'
'Oh, give me a fucking break!'
'Meaning?'
'Meaning, I've been out of storage six hours, if that.' I could hear my voice
starting to rise. 'Meaning, I've talked to precisely three people since the last time
we met. Meaning, I've never been on Earth in my life. Meaning, you know all
this. Now, are you going to ask me some intelligent questions or am I going to
bed?'
'All right, keep your skull on.' Ortega looked suddenly tired. She sank into the
lounger opposite mine. 'You told my sergeant they were professionals.'
'They were.' I'd decided it was the one piece of information I might as well share
with the police, since they'd probably find out anyway, as soon as they ran the
make on the two corpses through their files.
'Did they call you by name?'
I furrowed my brow with great: care. 'By name?'
'Yeah.' She made an impatient gesture. 'Did they call you Kovacs?'
'I don't think so.'
'Any other names?'
I raised an eyebrow. 'Such as?'
The weariness that had clouded her face retreated abruptly, and she gave me a
hard look. 'Forget it. We'll run the hotel's memory, and see.'

Oops.
'On Harlan's World you'd have to get a warrant for that.' I made it come out
lazily.
'We do here.' Ortega knocked ash off her cigarette onto the carpet. 'But it won't
be a problem. Apparently this isn't the first time the Hendrix has been up on an
organic damage charge. While ago, but the archives go back.'
'So how come it wasn't decommissioned?'
'I said up on charges, not convicted. Court threw it out. Demonstrable self
defence. Course,' she nodded over at the dormant gun turret, where two members
of the forensic team were running an emissions sweep, 'we're talking about
covert electrocution that time. Nothing like this.'
'Yeah, I was meaning to ask. Who fits that kind of hardware in a hotel anyway?'
'What do you think I am, a search construct?' Ortega had started watching me
with a speculative hostility I didn't much like. Then, abruptly, she shrugged.
'Archive precis I ran on the way over here says it got done a couple of centuries
back, when the corporate wars turned nasty. Makes sense. With all that shit
breaking loose, a lot of buildings were retooling to cope. Course, most of the
companies went under shortly afterwards with the trading crash, so no one ever
got around to passing a decommissioning bill. The Hendrix graded to artificial
intelligence status instead and bought itself out.'
'Smart.'
'Yeah, from what I hear the AIs were the only ones with any kind of real handle
on what was happening to the market anyway. Quite a few of them made the
break about then. Lot of the hotels on this strip are AI.' She grinned at me
through the smoke. 'That's why no one stays in them. Shame, really. I read
somewhere they're hard-wired to want customers the way people want sex.
That's got to be frustrating, right?'
'Right.'
One of the mohicans came and hovered over us. Ortega glanced up at him with a
look that said she didn't want to be disturbed.

'We got a make on the DNA samples,' the mohican said diffidently, and handed
her a videofax slate. Ortega scanned it and started.
'Well, well. You were in exalted company for a while, Kovacs.' She waved an
arm in the direction of the male corpse. 'Sleeve last registered to Dimitri
Kadmin, otherwise known as Dimi the Twin. Professional assassin out of
Vladivostock.'
'And the woman?'
Ortega and the mohican exchanged glances. 'Ulan Bator registry?'
'Got it in one, chief.'
'Got the motherfucker.' Ortega bounced to her feet with renewed energy. 'Let's
get their stacks excised and over to Fell Street. I want Dimi downloaded into
Holding before midnight.' She looked back at me. 'Kovacs, you may just have
proved useful.'
The mohican reached under his double-breasted suit and produced a heavybladed killing knife with the nonchalance of a man getting out cigarettes.
Together, they went over to the corpse and knelt beside it. Interested uniformed
officers drifted across to watch. There was the wet, cracking sound of cartilage
being cut open. After a moment, I got up and went to join the spectators. Nobody
paid any attention to me.
It was not what you'd call refined biotech surgery. The mohican had chopped out
a section of the corpse's spine to gain access to the base of the skull, and now he
was digging around with the point of the knife, trying to locate the cortical stack.
Kristin Ortega was holding the head steady in both hands.
'They bury them a lot deeper in than they used to,' she was saying. 'See if you
can get the rest of the vertebrae out, that's where it'll be.'
'I'm trying,' grunted the mohican. 'Some augmentation in here, I reckon. One of
those antishock washers Noguchi was talking about last time he was over . . .
Shit!! Thought I had it there.'
'No, look, you're working at the wrong angle. Let me try.' Ortega took the knife
and put one knee on the skull to steady it.

'Shit, I nearly had it, chief.'
'Yeah, yeah, I'm not spending all night watching you poke around in there.' She
glanced up and saw me watching her, nodded a brief acknowledgement and put
the serrated point of the blade in place. Then with a sharp blow to the haft of the
knife, she chopped something loose. She looked up at the mohican with a grin.
'Hear that?'
She reached down into the gore and pulled out the stack between finger and
thumb. It didn't look like much, impact-resistant casing streaked with blood and
barely the size of a cigarette butt with the twisted filaments of the microjacks
protruding stiffly from one end. I could see how the Catholics might not want to
believe this was the receptacle of the human soul.
'Gotcha, Dimi.' Ortega held up the stack to the light, then passed it and the knife
to the mohican. She wiped her fingers on the corpse's clothing. 'Right, let's get
the other one out of the woman.'
As we watched the mohican repeating the procedure on the second body, I tipped
my head close enough to Ortega to mutter.
'So you know who this one is as well?'
She jerked round to look at me, whether out of surprise or dislike of my
proximity I couldn't be sure. 'Yeah, this is Dimi the Twin too. Ha, pun! The
sleeve's registered out of Ulan Bator, which for your information is the black
market downloading capital of Asia. See, Dimi's not a very trusting soul. He
likes to have people he can be sure of backing him up. And the circles Dimi
mixes in, the only person you can really trust is you.'
'Those sound like familiar circles. Is it easy to get yourself copied on Earth?'
Ortega grimaced. 'Getting easier all the time. Technology the way it is now, a
state-of-the-art re-sleeving processor fits into a bathroom. Pretty soon it's going
to be an elevator. Then a suitcase.' She shrugged. 'Price of progress.'
'About the only way you can get it done on Harlan’s World is to file for a stellar
range 'cast, get an insurance copy held for the duration of the trip and then cancel
the transmission at the last minute. Fake a transit certificate, then claim a vital

interest for a temporary download from the copy. This guy's offworld and his
business is crumbling, that kind of thing. Download once from the original at the
transmission station, and again through the insurance company somewhere else.
Copy One walks out of the station legally. He just changed his mind about going.
Lots of people do. Copy Two never reports back to the insurance company for
re-storage. Costs a lot of money, though. You've got to bribe a lot of people, steal
a lot of machine time to get away with it.'
The mohican slipped and cut his thumb on the knife. Ortega rolled her eyes and
sighed in a compressed fashion. She turned back to face me.
'It's easier here,' she said shortly.
'Yeah? How's it work?'
'It — ' She hesitated, as if trying to work out why she was talking to me. 'Why do
you want to know?'
I grinned at her. 'Just naturally nosy, I guess.'

'OK, Kovacs.' She cupped both hands around her coffee mug. 'Works like this.
One day Mr Dimitri Kadmin walks into one of the big retrieval and re-sleeving
insurance companies. I mean someone really respectable, like Lloyds or
Cartwright Solar, maybe.'
'Is that here?' I gestured out at the bridge lights visible beyond the windows of
my room. 'In Bay City?'
The mohican had given Ortega some odd looks when she stayed behind as the
police departed the Hendrix. She saw him off with another admonition to get
Kadmin downloaded rapido, and then we went upstairs. She barely watched the
police cruisers leave.
'Bay City, East Coast, maybe even Europe.' Ortega sipped her coffee, wincing at
the overload of whisky she'd asked the Hendrix to dump in it. 'Doesn't matter.
What matters is the company. Someone established. Someone who's been
underwriting since downloading happened. Mr Kadmin wants to take out an
R&R policy, which, after a long discussion about premiums, he does. See, this

has got to look good. It's the long con, with the one difference that what we're
after here is more than money.'
I leaned back against my side of the window frame. The Watchtower suite had
been aptly named. All three rooms looked out across the city and the water
beyond, either north or westward, and the window shelf in the lounge accounted
for about a fifth of the available space, layered with psychedelically coloured
cushion mats. Ortega and I were seated opposite each other with a clean metre of
space between us.
'OK, so that's one copy. Then what?'
Ortega shrugged. 'Fatal accident.'
'In Ulan Bator?'
'Right. Dimi runs himself into a power pylon at high speed, falls out of a hotel
window, something like that. An Ulan Bator handling agent retrieves the stack,
and, for a hefty bribe, makes a copy. In come Cartwright Solar, or Lloyds with
their retrieval writ, freight Dimi (d.h.) back to their clone bank and download
him into the waiting sleeve. Thank you very much, sir. Nice doing business with
you.'
'Meanwhile . . . '
'Meanwhile the handling agent buys up a black market sleeve, probably some
catatonia case from a local hospital, or a scene-of-the-crime drugs victim who's
not too physically damaged. The Ulan Bator police do a screaming trade in
DOAs. The agent wipes the sleeve's mind, downloads Dimi's copy into it, and
the sleeve just walks out of there. Suborbital to the other side of the globe and
off to work in Bay City.'
'You don't catch these guys too often.'
'Almost never. Point is, you've got to catch both copies cold, either dead like this
or held on a UN indictable
offence. Without the UN rap, you've got no legal right to download from a living
body. And in a no-win situation, the twin just gets its cortical stack blown out
through the back of its neck before we can make the bust. I've seen it happen.'

'That's pretty severe. What's the penalty for all this.'
'Erasure.'
'Erasure? You do that here?'
Ortega nodded. There was a small, grim smile playing all around her mouth, but
never quite on it. 'Yeah, we do that here. Shock you?'
I thought about it. Some crimes in the Corps carried the erasure penalty,
principally desertion or refusal to obey a combat order, but I'd never seen it
applied. It ran counter to the conditioning to cut and run. And on Harlan's World
erasure had been abolished a decade before I was born.
'It's kind of old-fashioned, isn't it?'
'You feel bad about what's going to happen to Dimi?'
I ran the tip of my tongue over the cuts on the inside of my mouth. Thought
about the cold circle of metal at my neck and shook my head. 'No. But does it
stop with people like him?'
'There are a few other capital crimes, but they mostly get commuted to a couple
of centuries in storage.' The look on Ortega's face said she didn't think that was
such a great idea.
I put my coffee down and reached for a cigarette. The motions were automatic,
and I was too tired to stop them. Ortega waved away the offered pack. Touching
my own cigarette to the packet's ignition patch, I squinted at her.
'How old are you, Ortega?'
She looked back at me narrowly. 'Thirty-four. Why?'
'Never been d.h.'d, hmm?'
'Yeah, I had psychosurgery a few years back, they put me under for a couple of
days. Apart from that, no. I'm not a criminal, and I don't have the money for that
kind of travel.'

I let out the first breath of smoke. 'Kind of touchy about it, aren't you?'
'Like I said, I'm not a criminal.'
'No.' I thought back to the last time I had seen Virginia Vidaura. 'If you were,
you wouldn't think two hundred years dislocation was such an easy rap.'
'I didn't say that.'
'You didn't have to.' I didn't know what had led me to forget that Ortega was the
law, but something had. Something had been building in the space between the
two of us, something like a static charge, something I might have been able to
work out if my Envoy intuitions hadn't been so blunted by the new sleeve.
Whatever it was, it had just walked out of the room. I drew my shoulders in and
pulled harder on the cigarette. I needed sleep.
'Kadmin's expensive, right? With overheads like that, risks like that, he's got to
cost.'
'About twenty grand a hit.'
'Then Bancroft didn't commit suicide.'
Ortega raised an eyebrow. 'That's fast work, for someone who just got here.'
'Oh, come on.' I exploded a lungful of smoke at her. 'If it was suicide, who the
fuck paid out the twenty to have me hit?'
'You're well liked, are you?'
I leaned forward. 'No, I'm disliked in a lot of places, but not by anyone with
those kind of connections or that kind of money. I'm not classy enough to make
enemies at that level. Whoever set Kadmin on me knows I'm working for
Bancroft.'
Ortega grinned. 'Thought you said they didn't call you by name?'
Tired, Takeshi. I could almost see Virginia Vidaura wagging her finger at me.
The Envoy Corps don't get taken apart by local law.

I stumbled on as best I could.
'They knew who I was. Men like Kadmin don't hang around hotels waiting to rip
off the tourists. Ortega, come on.'

She let my exasperation sink into the silence before she answered me. 'So
Bancroft was hit as well? Maybe. So what?'

'So you've got to reopen the inquiry.'
'You don't listen, Kovacs.' She bent me a smile meant for stopping armed men in
their tracks. 'The case is closed.'
I sagged back against the wall and watched her through the smoke for a while.
Finally, I said, 'You know, when your clean-up squad arrived tonight one of them
showed me his badge for long enough to actually see it. Quite fancy, close up.
That eagle and shield. All the lettering around it.'
She made a get-on-with-it gesture, and I took another pull on my cigarette before
I sank the barb in.
'To protect and serve? I guess by the time you make lieutenant, you don't really
believe that stuff any more.'
Contact. A muscle jumped under one eye and her cheeks pulled in as if she was
sucking on something bitter. She stared at me, and for that moment I thought I
might have pushed too far. Then her shoulders slumped and she sighed.
'Ah, go ahead. What the fuck do you know about it anyway? Bancroft's not
people like you and me. He's a fucking Meth.'
'A Meth?'
'Yeah. A Meth. You know, and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred
sixty and nine years. He's old. I mean, really old.'

'Is that a crime, lieutenant?'
'It should be,' said Ortega grimly. 'You live that long, things start happening to
you. You get too impressed with yourself. Ends up, you think you're God.
Suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well they don't really
matter any more. You've seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel
you're standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you. And maybe
you'll start snuffing those little people, just like picking daisies, if they get under
your feet.'
I looked seriously at her. 'You pin anything like that on Bancroft? Ever?'
'I'm not talking about Bancroft,' she waved the objection aside impatiently, 'I'm
talking about his kind. They're like the AIs. They're a breed apart. They're not
human, they deal with humanity the way you and I deal with insect life. Well,
when you're dealing with the Bay City police department, having that kind of
attitude can sometimes backup on you.'
I thought briefly of Reileen Kawahara's excesses, and wondered how far off the
mark Ortega really was. On Harlan’s World, most people could afford to be resleeved at least once, but the point was that unless you were very rich you had to
live out your full span each time and old age, even with antisen treatment, was a
wearying business. Second time around was worse because you knew what to
expect. Not many had the stamina to do it more than twice. Most people went
into voluntary storage after that, with occasional temporary re-sleevings for
family matters, and of course even those re-sleevings thinned out as time passed
and new generations bustled in without the old ties.
It took a certain kind of person to keep going, to want to keep going, life after
life, sleeve after sleeve. You had to start out different, never mind what you
might become as the centuries piled up.
'So Bancroft gets short-changed because he's a Meth. Sorry, Laurens, you're an
arrogant, long-lived bastard. The Bay City police has got better things to do with
its time than take you seriously. That kind of thing.'
But Ortega wasn't rising to the bait any more. She sipped her coffee and made a
dismissive gesture. 'Look, Kovacs. Bancroft is alive, and whatever the facts of
the case he's got enough security to stay that way. No one here is groaning under
the burden of a miscarriage of justice. The police department is underfunded,

understaffed and overworked. We don't have the resources to chase Bancroft's
phantoms indefinitely.'
'And if they're not phantoms?'
Ortega sighed. 'Kovacs, I went over that house myself three times with the
forensics team. There's no sign of a struggle, no break in the perimeter defences
and no trace of an intruder anywhere in the security net's records. Miriam
Bancroft volunteered to take every state-of-the-art polygraphic test there is and
she passed them all without a tremor. She did not kill her husband, no one broke
in and killed her husband. Laurens Bancroft killed himself, for reasons best
known to himself, and that's all there is to it. I'm sorry you're supposed to prove
otherwise, but wishing isn't going to make it fucking so. It's an open-and-shut
case.'
'And the phone call? The fact Bancroft wasn't exactly going to forget he had
remote storage? The fact someone thinks I'm important enough to send Kadmin
out here?'
'I'm not going to argue the toss with you on this, Kovacs. We'll interrogate
Kadmin and find out what he knows, but for the rest I've been over the ground
before and it's starting to bore me. There are people out there who need us a lot
worse than Bancroft does. Real death victims who weren't lucky enough to have
remote storage when their stacks were blown out. Catholics getting butchered
because their killers know the victims will never come out of storage to put them
away.' There was a hooded tiredness building up in Ortega's eyes as she ticked
the list off on her fingers. 'Organic damage cases who don't have the money to
get re-sleeved unless the state can prove some kind of liability against somebody.
I wade through this stuff ten hours a day or more, and I'm sorry, I just don't have
the sympathy to spare for Mr Laurens Bancroft with his clones on ice and his
magic walls of influence in high places and his fancy lawyers to put us through
hoops every time some member of his family or staff wants to slide out from
under.'
'That happen often, does it?'
'Often enough, but don't look surprised.' She gave me a bleak smile. 'He's a
fucking Meth. They're all the same.'
It was a side of her I didn't like, an argument I didn't want to have and a view of

Bancroft I didn't need. And underneath it all, my nerves were screaming for
sleep.
I stubbed out my cigarette.
'I think you'd better go, lieutenant. All this prejudice is giving me a headache.'
Something flickered in her eyes, something I couldn't read at all. There for a
second, then gone. She shrugged, put down the coffee mug and swung her legs
over the side of the shelf. She stretched herself upright, arched her spine until it
cracked audibly and walked to the door without looking back. I stayed where I
was, watching her reflection move among the city lights in the window.
At the door, she stopped and I saw her turn her head.
'Hey, Kovacs.'
I looked over at her. 'Forget something?'
She nodded her head, mouth clamped in a crooked line, as if acknowledging a
point in some game we'd been playing.
'You want an insight? You want somewhere to start? Well, you gave me Kadmin,
so I guess I owe you that.'
'You don't owe me a thing, Ortega. The Hendrix did it, not me.'
'Leila Begin,' she said. 'Run that by Bancroft's fancy lawyers, see where it gets
you.'
The door sliced closed and the reflected room held nothing but the lights of the
city outside. I stared out at them for a while, lit a new cigarette and smoked it:
down to its filter.
Bancroft had not committed suicide, that much was clear. I'd been on the case
less than a day and already I'd had two separate lobbies land on my back. First,
Kristin Ortega's mannered thugs at the justice facility, then the Vladivostock
hitman and his spare sleeve. Not to mention Miriam Bancroft's off-the-wall
behaviour. Altogether too much muddied water for this to be what it purported to
be. Ortega wanted something, whoever had paid Dimitri Kadmin wanted

something, and what they wanted, it seemed, was for the Bancroft case to remain
closed.
That wasn't an option I had.
'Your guest has left the building,' said the Hendrix, jolting me out of my glazed
retrospection.
'Thanks,' I said absently, stubbing out the cigarette in an ashtray. 'Can you lock
the door, and block the elevators from this floor?'
'Certainly. Do you wish to be advised of any entry into the hotel?'
'No.' I yawned like a snake trying to engorge an egg. 'Just don't let them up here.
And no calls for the next seven-and-a-half hours.'
Abruptly it was all I could do to get out of my clothes before the waves of sleep
overwhelmed me. I left Bancroft's summer suit draped over a convenient chair
and crawled into the massive crimson-sheeted bed. The surface of the bed
undulated briefly, adjusting to my body weight and size, then bore me up like
water. A faint odour of incense drifted from the sheets.
I made a half-hearted attempt to masturbate, mind churning damply through
images of Miriam Bancroft's voluptuous curves, but I kept seeing Sarah's pale
body turned to wreckage by the Kalashnikov fire instead.
And sleep dragged me under.

CHAPTER SEVEN

There are ruins, steeped in shadow, and a blood-red sun going down in turmoil
behind distant hills. Overhead soft-bellied clouds panic towards the horizon like
whales before the harpoon, and the wind runs addict's fingers through the trees
that line the street.
Innenininennininennin . . .
I know this place.
I pick my way between the devastated walls of ruins, trying not to brush against
them because, whenever I do, they give out muted gunshots and screams, as if
whatever conflict murdered this city has soaked into the remaining stonework. At
the same time, I'm moving quite fast, because there is something following me,
something that has no such qualms about touching the ruins. I can chart its
progress quite accurately by the tide of gunfire and anguish swelling behind me.
It is closing. I try to speed up but there is a tightness in my throat and chest that
isn't helping matters.
Jimmy de Soto steps out from behind the shattered stub of a tower. I'm not really
surprised to see him here, but his ruined face still gives me a jolt. He grins with
what's left of his features and puts a hand on my shoulder. I try not to flinch.
''Leila Begin,' he says, and nods back to where I have come from. 'Run that by
Bancroft's fancy lawyer.'

'I will,' I say, moving past him. But his hand stays on my shoulder, which must
m,ean his arm is stretching out behind me like hot wax. I stop, guilty at the pain
that must be causing him, but he's still there at my shoulder. I start m,oving
again.
'Going to turn and fight?' he asks conversationally, drifting along beside me
without apparent effort or footing.
'With what?' I say, opening my empty hands.
'Should have armed yourself, pal. Big time.'
Virginia told us not to fall for the weakness of weapons.'
Jimmy de Soto marts derisively. 'Yeah, and look where that stupid bitch ended
up. Eighty to a hundred, no remission.'
'You can't know that,' I say absently, more interested in the sounds of pursuit
behind me. 'You died years before that happened.'
'Oh, come on, who really dies these days?'
'Try telling that to a Catholic. And anyway, you did die, Jimmy. Irretrievably, as I
recall.'
'What's a Catholic?'
'Tell you later. You got any cigarettes.'
'Cigarettes? What happened to your arm?'
I break the spiral of non sequiturs and stare down at my arm. Jimmy's got a
point. The scars on my forearm have turned into a fresh wound, blood welling up
and trickling down into my hand. So of course . . .
I reach up to my left eye and find the wetness below it. My fingers come away
bloody.
'Lucky one,' says Jimmy de Soto judicially. 'They missed the socket.'
He should know. His own left socket is a glutted well of gore, all that was left at

Innenin when he dug the eyeball out with his fingers. No one ever found out what
he was hallucinating at the time. By the time they got Jimmy and the rest of the
Innenin beachhead d.h.'d for psychosurgery, the defenders' virus had scrambled
their minds beyond retrieval. The program was so virulent that at the time the
clinic didn't even dare keep what was left on stack for study. The remains of
Jimmy de Soto are on a sealed disc with red DATA CONTAMINANT decals
somewhere in a basement at Envoy Corps HQ.
'I've got to do something about this,' I say, a little desperately. The sounds
awoken from the walls by my pursuer are growing dangerously close. The last of
the sun is slipping behind the hills. Blood spills down my arm and face.
'Smell that?' Jimmy asks, lifting his man face to the chilly air around us. 'They're
changing it.'
'What?' But even as I snap the retort, I can smell it as well. A fresh, invigorating
scent, not unlike the incense back at the Hendrix, but subtly different, not quite
the heady decadence of the original odour I fell asleep to only . . .
'Got to go,' says Jimmy, and Pm about to ask him where when I realise he means
me and I'm
Awake.
My eyes snapped open on one of the psychedelic murals of the hotel room. Slim,
waif-like figures in kaftans dotted across a field of green grass and yellow and
white flowers. I frowned and clutched at the hardened scar tissue on my forearm.
No blood. With the realisation, I carne fully awake and sat up in the big crimson
bed. The shift in the smell of incense that had originally nudged me towards
consciousness was fully resolved into that of coffee and fresh bread. The
Hendrix's olfactory wake-up call. Light was pouring into the dimmed room
through a flaw in the polarised glass of the window.
'You have a visitor,' said the voice of the Hendrix briskly.
'What time is it?' I croaked. The back of my throat seemed to have been liberally
painted with supercooled glue.
'Ten-sixteen, locally. You have slept for seven hours and forty-two minutes.'

'And my visitor?'
'Oumou Prescott,' said the hotel. 'Do you require breakfast?'
I got out of bed and headed for the bathroom. 'Yes. Coffee with milk, white
meat, well-cooked, and fruit juice of some kind. You can send Prescott up.'
By the time the door chimed at me, I was out of the shower and padding around
in an iridescent blue bathrobe trimmed with gold braid. I collected my breakfast
from the service hatch and balanced the tray on one hand while I opened the
door.
Oumou Prescott was a tall, impressive-looking African woman, topping my
sleeve by a couple of centimetres, her hair braided back with dozens of oval
glass beads in seven or eight of my favourite colours and her cheekbones lined
with some sort of abstract tattooing. She stood on the threshold in a pale grey
suit and a long black coat turned up at the collar, and looked at me doubtfully.
'Mr Kovacs.'
'Yes, come in. Would you like some breakfast?' I laid the tray on the unmade
bed.
'No, thank you. Mr Kovacs, I am Laurens Bancroft's principal legal
representative via the firm of Prescott, Forbes and Hernandez. Mr Bancroft
informed me —
'Yes, I know.' I picked up a piece of grilled chicken from the tray.
'The point is, Mr Kovacs, we have an appointment with Dennis Nyman at
PsychaSec in . . . ' Her eyes flicked briefly upward to consult a retinal watch.
'Thirty minutes.'
'I see,' I said, chewing slowly. 'I didn't know that.'
'I've been calling since eight this morning, but the hotel refused to put me
through. I didn't realise you would sleep so late.'
I grinned at her through a mouthful of chicken. 'Faulty research, then. I was only
sleeved yesterday.'

She stiffened a little at that, but then a professional calm asserted itself. She
crossed the room and took a seat on the window shelf.
'We'll be late, then,' she said. 'I guess you need breakfast.'

It was cold in the middle of the Bay.
I climbed out of the autocab into watery sunshine and a buffeting wind. It had
rained during the night, and there were still a few piles of grey cumulus skulking
around inland, sullenly resisting the attempts of a stiff sea breeze to sweep them
away. I turned up the collar of my summer suit and made a mental note to buy a
coat. Nothing serious, something coming to mid thigh with a collar and pockets
big enough to stuff your hands in.
Beside me, Prescott was looking unbearably snug inside her coat. She paid off
the cab with a swipe of her thumb and we both stood back as it rose. A welcome
rush of warm air from the lift turbines washed over my hands and face. I blinked
my eyes against the small storm of grit and dust and saw how Prescott raised one
slender arm to do the same. Then the cab was gone, droning away to join the
beehive activity in the sky above the mainland. Prescott turned to the building
behind us and gestured with one laconic thumb.
'This way.'
I pushed my hands into the inadequate pockets of my suit and followed her lead.
Bent slightly into the wind, we picked our way up the long, winding steps to
PsychaSec Alcatraz.
I'd expected a high-security installation, and I wasn't disappointed. PsychaSec
was laid out in a series of long, low double-storey modules with deeply recessed
windows reminiscent of a military command bunker. The only break in this
pattern was a single dome at the western end which I guessed had to house the
satellite uplink gear. The whole complex was a pale granite grey and the
windows a smoky reflectant orange. There was no holodisplay, or broadcast
publicity, in fact nothing to announce we'd got the right place except a sober
plaque laser-engraved into the sloping stone wall of the entrance block:

PsychaSec S.A.
________________

D.H.F. Retrieval and Secure Holding
Clonic Re-sleeving

Above the plaque was a small black sentry eye flanked by heavily grilled
speakers. Oumou Prescott raised her arm and waved at it.
'Welcome to PsychaSec Alcatraz,' said a construct voice briskly. 'Please identify
yourself within the fifteen-second security time limit.'
'Oumou Prescott and Takeshi Kovacs to see Director Nyman. We have an
appointment.'
A thin, green scanning laser flickered over us both from head to foot and then a
section of the wall hinged smoothly back and down forming a passage inside.
Glad to get out of the wind, I stepped nimbly into the niche and followed orange
runway lights down a short corridor into a reception area, leaving Prescott to
bring up the rear. As soon as we stepped off the walkway and into reception, the
massive door slab rumbled upright and closed again. Solid security.
Reception was a circular, warmly lit area with banks of seats and low tables set
at the cardinal compass points. There were small groups of people seated north
and east, conversing in low tones. In the centre was a circular desk where a
receptionist sat behind a battery of secretarial equipment. No artificial constructs
here; this was a real human being, a slim young man barely out of his teens who
looked up with intelligent eyes as we approached.
'You can go right through, Ms Prescott. The Director's office is up the stairs and
third door on your right.'
'Thank you.' Prescott took the lead again, turning back briefly to mutter as soon
as we were out of earshot of the receptionist, 'Nyman's a bit impressed with

himself since this place was built, but he's basically a good person. Try not to let
him irritate you.'
'Sure.'
We followed the receptionist's instructions until, outside the aforementioned
door I had to stop and suppress a snigger. Nyman's door, no doubt in the best
possible Earth taste, was pure mirrorwood from top to bottom. After the highprofile security system and flesh and blood reception, it seemed about as subtle
as the vaginal spittoons at Madame Mi's Wharfwhore Warehouse. My
amusement must have been evident because Prescott gave me a frown as she
knocked on the door.
'Come.'
Sleep had done wonders for the interface between my mind and my new sleeve.
Composing my rented features, I followed Prescott into the room.
Nyman was at his desk, ostensibly working at a grey and green coloured
holodisplay. He was a thin, serious-looking man who affected steel-rimmed
external eyelenses to go with his expensively cut black suit and short, tidy hair.
His expression, behind the lenses, was slightly resentful. He'd not been happy
when Prescott phoned him from the cab to say we would be delayed, but
Bancroft had obviously been in touch with him because he accepted the later
appointment time with the stiff acquiescence of a disciplined child.
'Since you have requested a viewing of our facilities here, Mr Kovacs, shall we
start? I have cleared my agenda for the next couple of hours, but I do have
clients waiting.'
Something about Nyman's manner brought Warden Sullivan to mind, but it was
an altogether smoother, less embittered Sullivan. I glanced over Nyman's suit
and face. Perhaps if the Warden had made his career in storage for the super rich
instead of the criminal element he might have turned out like this.
'Fine.'
It got pretty dull after that. PsychaSec, like most d.h.f. depots, wasn't much more
than a gigantic set of air-conditioned warehouse shelves. We tramped through
basement rooms cooled to the 7 to 11 degrees Celsius recommended by the

makers of altered carbon, peered at racks of the big thirty-centimetre expanded
format discs and admired the retrieval robots that ran on wide-gauge rails along
the storage walls. 'It's a duplex system,' said Nyman proudly. 'Every client is
stored on two separate discs in different parts of the building. Random code
distribution, only the central processor can find them both and there's a lock on
the system to prevent simultaneous access to both copies. To do any real
damage, you'd have to break in and get past all the security systems twice.'
I made polite noises.
'Our satellite uplink operates through a network of no less than eighteen secure
clearing orbital platforms, leased in random sequence.' Nyman was getting
carried away with his own sales pitch. He seemed to have forgotten that neither
Prescott nor myself were in the market for PsychaSec's services. 'No orbital is
leased for more than twenty seconds at a time. Remote storage updates come in
via needlecast, with no way to predict the transmission route.'
Strictly speaking, that wasn't true. Given an artificial intelligence of sufficient
size and inclination, you'd get it right sooner or later, but this was clutching at
straws. The kind of enemies who used AIs to get at you didn't need to finish you
off with a particle blaster to the head. I was looking in the wrong place.
'Can I get access to Bancroft's clones?' I asked Prescott abruptly.
'From a legal point of view?' Prescott shrugged. 'Mr Bancroft's instructions give
you carte blanche as far as I know.'
Carte blanche? Prescott had been springing these on me all morning. The words
almost had the taste of the heavy parchment. It was like something an Alain
Marriott character would say in a Settlement years flic.
Well, you're on Earth now. I turned to Nyman, who nodded grudgingly.
'There are some procedures,' he said.
We went back up to ground level, along corridors that forcibly reminded me of
the re-sleeving facility at Bay City Central by their very dissimilarity. No rubber
gurney wheel tracks here — the sleeve transporters would be air cushion
vehicles — and the corridor walls were decked out in pastel shades. The
windows, bunker peepholes from the outside, were framed and corniched in

Gaudн-style waves on the inside. At one corner we passed a woman cleaning
them by hand. I raised an eyebrow. No end to the extravagance.
Nyman caught the look. 'There are some jobs that robot labour just never gets
quite right,' he said.
'I'm sure.'
The clone banks appeared on our left, heavy, sealed doors in bevelled and
sculpted steel counterpointing the ornate windows. We stopped at one and
Nyman peered into the retina scan set beside it. The door hinged smoothly
outwards, fully a metre thick in tungsten steel. Within was a four-metre long
chamber with a similar door at the far end. We stepped inside, and the outer door
swung shut with a soft thud that pushed the air into my ears.
'This is an airtight chamber,' said Nyman redundantly. 'We will receive a sonic
cleansing to ensure that we bring no contaminants into the clone bank. No reason
to be alarmed.'
A light in the ceiling pulsed on and off in shades of violet to signify that the dustoff was in progress and then the second door opened with no more sound than
the first. We walked out into the Bancroft family vault.
I'd seen this sort of thing before. Reileen Kawahara had maintained a small one
for her transit clones on New Beijing, and of course the Corps had them in
abundance. Still, I'd never seen anything quite like this.
The space was oval, dome-ceilinged, and must have extended through both
storeys of the installation. It was huge, the size of a temple back home. Lighting
was low, a drowsy orange, and the temperature was blood-warm. The clone sacs
were everywhere, veined translucent pods of the same orange as the light,
suspended from the ceiling by cables and nutrient tubes. The clones were
vaguely discernible within, foetal bundles of arms and legs, but fully grown. Or
at least, most were; towards the top of the dome I could see smaller sacs where
new additions to the stock were being cultured. The sacs were organic, a
toughened analogue of womb lining, and they would grow with the foetus within
to become like the metre and a half lozenges in the lower half of the vault. The
whole crop hung there like an insane mobile, just waiting for some huge sickly
breeze to stir it into motion.

Nyman cleared his throat, and both Prescott and I shook off the paralysed
wonder that had gripped us on the threshold.
'This may look haphazard,' he said, 'but the spacing is computer generated.'
'I know.' I nodded and went closer to one of the lower sacs. 'It's fractal-derived,
right?'
'Ah, yes.' Nyman seemed almost to resent my knowledge.
I peered in at the clone. Centimetres away from my face Miriam Bancroft's
features dreamed in amniotic fluid beneath the membrane. Her arms were folded
protectively across her breasts and her hands were folded lightly into fists under
her chin. Her hair had been gathered into a thick, coiled snake on the top of her
head and covered in some kind of web.
'The whole family's here,' murmured Prescott at my shoulder. 'Husband and wife,
and all sixty-one children. Most only have one or two clones, but Bancroft and
his wife run to six each. Impressive, huh?'
'Yeah.' Despite myself, I had to put out a hand and touch the membrane above
Miriam Bancroft's face. It was warm, and gave slightly under my hand. There
was raised scarring around the entry points of the nutrient feeds and waste pipes,
and in tiny pimples where needles had been pushed through to extract tissue
samples or provide IV additives. The membrane would give in to such penetrations and heal afterwards.
I turned away from the dreaming woman and faced Nyman.
'This is all very nice, but presumably you don't shell one of these whenever
Bancroft comes in here. You must have tanks as well.'
'This way.' Nyman gestured us to follow him and went to the back of the
chamber where another pressure door was set into the wall. The lowest sacs
swayed eerily in the wake of our passage, and I had to duck to avoid brushing
against one. Nyman's fingers played a brief tarantella over the keypad of the
pressure door and we went though into a long, low room whose clinical
illumination was almost blinding after the womb light of the main vault. A row
of eight metallic cylinders not unlike the one I'd woken up in yesterday were
ranked along one wall, but where my birthing tube had been unpainted and

scarred with the million tiny defacements of frequent use, these units carried a
thick gloss of cream paint with yellow trim around the transparent observation
plate and the various functional protrusions.
'Full life support suspension chambers,' said Nyman. 'Essentially the same
environment as the pods. This is where all the re-sleeving is done. We bring
fresh clones through, still in the pod, and load them here. The tank nutrients have
an enzyme to break down the pod wall, so the transition is completely traumafree. Any clinical work is carried out by staff working in synthetic sleeves, to
avoid any risk of contamination.'
I caught the exasperated rolling of Oumou Prescott's eyes on the periphery of my
vision and a grin twitched at the corner of my mouth.
'Who has access to this chamber?'
'Myself, authorised staff under a day code. And the owners, of course.'
I wandered down the line of cylinders, bending to examine the data displays at
the foot of each one. There was a Miriam clone in the sixth, and two of Naomi's
at seven and eight.
'You've got the daughter on ice twice?'
'Yes.' Nyman looked puzzled, and then slightly superior. This was his chance to
get back the initiative he'd lost on the fractal patterning. 'Have you not been
informed of her current condition?'
'Yeah, she's in psychosurgery,' I growled. 'That doesn't explain why there's two
of her here.'
'Well.' Nyman darted a glance back at Prescott, as if to say that the divulging of
further information involved some legal dimension. The lawyer cleared her
throat.
'PsychaSec have instructions from Mr Bancroft to always hold a spare clone of
himself and his immediate family ready for decanting. While Ms Bancroft is
committed to the Vancouver psychiatric stack, both sleeves are stored here.'
'The Bancrofts like to alternate their sleeves,' said Nyman knowledgeably. 'Many

of our clients do, it saves on wear and tear. The human body is capable of quite
remarkable regeneration if stored correctly, and of course we offer a complete
package of clinical repair for more major damage. Very reasonably priced.'
'I'm sure it is.' I turned back from the end cylinder and grinned at him. 'Still, not
much you can do for a vaporised head, is there?'
There was a brief silence, during which Prescott looked fixedly at a corner of the
ceiling and Nyman's lips tightened to almost anal proportions.
'I consider that remark in very poor taste,' the director said finally. 'Do you have
any more important questions, Mr Kovacs?'
I paused next to Miriam Bancroft's cylinder and looked into it. Even through the
fogging effect of the observation plate and the gel, there was a sensual
abundance to the blurred form within.
'Just one question. Who decides when to alternate the sleeves?'
Nyman glanced across at Prescott as if to enlist legal support for his words. 'I am
directly authorised by Mr Bancroft to effect the transfer on every occasion that
he is digitised, unless specifically required not to. He made no such request on
this occasion.'
There was something here, scratching at the Envoy antennae; something
somewhere fitted. It was too early to give it concrete form. I looked around the
room.
'This place is entry-monitored, right?'
'Naturally.' Nyman's tone was still chilly.
'Was there much activity the day Bancroft went to Osaka?'
'No more than usual. Mr Kovacs, the police have already been through these
records. I really don't see what value — '
'Indulge me,' I suggested, not looking at him, and the Envoy cadences in my
voice shut him down like a circuit breaker.

Two hours later I was staring out of the window of another autocab as it kicked
off from the Alcatraz landing quay and climbed over the Bay.
'Did you find what you were looking for?'
I glanced at Oumou Prescott, wondering if she could sense the frustration
coming off me. I thought I'd got most of the external giveaways on this sleeve
locked down, but I'd heard of lawyers who got empath conditioning to pick up
more subliminal clues to their witnesses' states of mind when on the stand. And
here, on Earth, it wouldn't surprise me if Oumou Prescott had a full infrared
subsonic body and voice scan package racked into her beautiful ebony head.
The entry data for the Bancroft vault, Thursday 16th August, was as free of
suspicious comings and goings as the Mishima Mall on a Tuesday afternoon.
Eight a.m., Bancroft came in with two assistants, stripped off and climbed into
the waiting tank. The assistants left with his clothes. Fourteen hours later his
alternate clone climbed dripping out of the neighbouring tank, collected a towel
from another assistant and went to get a shower. No words exchanged beyond
pleasantries. Nothing.
I shrugged. 'I don't know. I don't really know what I'm looking for yet.'
Prescott yawned. 'Total Absorb, huh?'
'Yeah, that's right.' I looked at her more closely. 'You know much about the
Corps?'
'Bit. I did my articles in UN litigation. You pick up the terminology. So what
have you absorbed so far?'
'Only that there's a lot of smoke building up around something the authorities say
isn't burning. You ever meet the lieutenant that ran the case?'
'Kristin Ortega. Of course. I'm not likely to forget her. We were yelling at each
other across a desk for the best part of a week.'
'Impressions?'

'Of Ortega?' Prescott looked surprised. 'Good cop, as far as I know. Got a
reputation for being very tough. The Organic Damage Division are the police
department's hard men, so earning a reputation like that wouldn't have been easy.
She ran the case efficiently enough — '
'Not for Bancroft's liking.'
Pause. Prescott looked at me warily. 'I said efficiently. I didn't say persistently.
Ortega did her job, but — '
'But she doesn't like Meths, right?'
Another pause. 'You have quite an ear for the street, Mr Kovacs.'
'You pick up the terminology,' I said modestly. 'Do you think Ortega would have
kept the case open if Bancroft hadn't been a Meth?'
Prescott thought about it for a while. 'It's a common enough prejudice,' she said
slowly, 'But I don't get the impression Ortega shut us down because of it. I think
she just saw a limited return on her investment. The police department has a
promotion system based at least partly on the number of cases solved. No one
saw a quick solution to this one, and Mr Bancroft was alive, so . . . '
'Better things to do, huh?'
'Yes. Something like that.'
I stared out the window some more. The cab was flitting across the tops of
slender multi-storey stacks and the traffic-crammed crevices between. I could
feel an old fury building in me that had nothing to do with my current problems.
Something that had accrued through the years in the Corps and the emotional
rubble you got used to seeing, like silt on the surface of your soul. Virginia
Vidaura, Jimmy de Soto, dying in my arms at Innenin, Sarah . . . A loser's
catalogue, any way you looked at it.
I locked it down.
The scar under my eye was itching, and there was the curl of the nicotine craving
in my fingertips. I rubbed at the scar. Left the cigarettes in my pocket. At some
indeterminate point this morning I'd determined to quit. A thought struck me at

random.
'Prescott, you chose this sleeve for me, right?'
'Sorry?' She was scanning through a subretinal projection, and it took her a
moment to refocus on me. 'What did you say?'
'This sleeve. You chose it, right?'
She frowned. 'No. As far as I know that selection was made by Mr Bancroft. We
just provided the shortlist according to specifications.'
'No, he told me his lawyers had handled it. Definitely.'
'Oh.' The frown cleared away, and she smiled faintly. 'Mr Bancroft has a great
many lawyers. Probably he routed it through another office. Why?'
I grunted. 'Nothing. Whoever owned this body before was a smoker, and I'm not.
It's a real pain in the balls.'
Prescott's smile gained ground. 'Are you going to give up?'
'If I can find the time. Bancroft's deal is, I crack the case, I can be re-sleeved no
expense spared, so it doesn't really matter long term. I just hate waking up with a
throatful of shit every morning.'
'Do you think you can?'
'Give up smoking?'
'No. Crack this case.'
I looked at her, deadpan. 'I don't really have any other option, counsellor. Have
you read the terms of my employment?'
'Yes. I drew them up.' Prescott gave me back the deadpan look, but buried
beneath it were traces of the discomfort that I needed to see to stop me reaching
across the cab and smashing her nose bone up into her brain with one stiffened
hand.
'Well, well,' I said, and went back to looking out of the window.

AND MY FIST UP YOUR WIFE'S CUNT WITH YOU WATCHING YOU
FUCKING METH MOTHERFUCKER YOU CAN'T
I slipped off the headset and blinked. The text had carried some crude but
effective virtual graphics and a subsonic that made my head buzz. Across the
desk, Prescott looked at me with knowing sympathy.
'Is it all like this?' I asked.
'Well, it gets less coherent.' She gestured at the holograph display floating above
the desktop, where representations of the files I was accessing tumbled in cool
shades of blue and green. 'This is what we call the R&R stack. Rabid and
Rambling. Actually, these guys are mostly too far gone to be any real threat, but
it's not nice, knowing they're out there.'
'Ortega bring any of them in?'
'It's not her department. The Transmission Felony Division catches a few every
now and then, when we squawk loudly enough about it, but dissemination technology being the way it is, it's like trying to throw a net over smoke. And even
when you do catch them, the worst they'll get is a few months in storage. It's a
waste of time. We mostly just sit on this stuff until Bancroft says we can delete
it.'
'And nothing new in the last six months?'
Prescott shrugged. 'The religious lunatics, maybe. Some increased traffic from
the Catholics on Resolution 653. Mr Bancroft has an undeclared influence in the
UN Court, which is more or less common knowledge. Oh, and some Martian
archaeological sect has been screaming about that Songspire he keeps in his hall.
Apparently last month was the anniversary of their founder's martyrdom by
leaky pressure suit. But none of these people have the wherewithal to crack the
perimeter defences at Suntouch House.'
I tilted my chair back and stared up at the ceiling. A flight of grey birds angled
overhead in a southward pointing chevron. Their voices were faintly audible,
honking to each other. Prescott's office was environment-formatted, all six
internal surfaces projecting virtual images. Currently, her grey metal desk was

incongruously positioned halfway down a sloping meadow on which the sun was
beginning to decline, complete with a small herd of cattle in the distance and
occasional birdsong. The image resolution was some of the best I'd seen.
'Prescott, what can you tell me about Leila Begin?'
The silence that ensued pulled my eyes back down to ground level. Oumou
Prescott was staring off into a corner of the field.
'I suppose Kristin Ortega gave you that name,' she said slowly.
'Yeah.' I sat up. 'She said it would give me some insight into Bancroft. In fact,
she told me to run it by you to see if you rattled.'
Prescott swivelled to face me. 'I don't see how this can have any bearing on the
case at hand.'
'Try me.'
'Very well.' There was a snap in her voice as she said it, and a defiant look on her
face. 'Leila Begin was a prostitute. Maybe still is. Fifty years ago, Bancroft was
one of her clients. Through a number of indiscretions, this became known to
Miriam Bancroft. The two women met at some function down in San Diego,
apparently agreed to go to the bathroom together, and Miriam Bancroft beat the
shit out of Leila Begin.'
I studied Prescott's face across the table, puzzled. 'And that's it?'
'No, that's not it, Kovacs,' she said tiredly. 'Begin was six months pregnant at the
time. She lost the child as a result of the beating. You physically can't fit a spinal
stack into a foetus, so that made it real death. Potential three-to five-decade
sentence.'
'Was it Bancroft's baby?'
Prescott shrugged. 'Debatable. Begin refused to let them do a gene match on the
foetus. Said it was irrelevant who the father was. She probably figured the
uncertainty was more valuable from a press point of view than a definite no.'
'Or she was too distraught?'

'Come on, Kovacs.' Prescott jerked a hand irritably at me. 'This is an Oakland
whore we're talking about.'
'Did Miriam Bancroft go into storage?'
'No, and that's where Ortega gets to stick her knife in. Bancroft bought off
everybody. The witnesses, the press, even Begin took a pay-off in the end.
Settled out of court. Enough to get her a Lloyds cloning policy and take her out
of the game. Last I heard, she was wearing out her second sleeve somewhere
down in Brazil. But this is half a century ago, Kovacs.'
'Were you around?'
'No.' Prescott leaned across the desk. 'And neither was Kristin Ortega, which
makes it kind of sickening to hear her whining on about it. Oh, I had an earful of
it too, when they pulled out of the investigation last month. She never even met
Begin.'
'I think it might be a matter of principle,' I said gently. 'Is Bancroft still going to
prostitutes on a regular basis?'
'That is none of my concern.'
I stuck my finger through the holographic display and watched the coloured files
distort around the intrusion. 'You might have to make it your concern, counsellor.
Sexual jealousy's a pretty sturdy motive for murder, after all.'
'May I remind you that Miriam Bancroft tested negative on a polygraph when
asked that question,' said Frescott sharply.
'I'm not talking about Mrs Bancroft.' I stopped playing with the display and
stared across the desk at the lawyer before me. 'I'm talking about the other
million available orifices out there and the even larger number of partners or
blood relatives who might not relish seeing some Meth fucking them. That's
going to have to include some experts on covert penetration, no pun intended,
and maybe the odd psychopath or two. In short, someone capable of getting into
Bancroft's house and torching him.'
Off in the distance, one of the cows lowed mournfully.

'What about it, Prescott.' I waved my hand through the holograph. 'Anything in
here that begins FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY GIRL, DAUGHTER, SISTER,
MOTHER, DELETE AS APPLICABLE?'
I didn't need her to answer me. I could see it in her face.
With the sun painting slanting stripes across the desk and birdsong in the trees
across the meadow, Oumou Prescott bent: to the database keyboard and called up
a new purple oblong of holographic light on the display. I watched as it bloomed
and opened like some Cubist rendition of an orchid. Behind me, another cow
voiced its resigned disgruntlement.
I slipped the headset back on.

CHAPTER EIGHT

The town was called Ember. I found it on the map, about two hundred kilometres
north of Bay City, on the coast road. There was an asymmetrical yellow symbol
in the sea next to it.
'Free Trade Enforcer,' said Prescott, peering over my shoulder. 'Aircraft carrier.
It was the last really big warship anyone ever built. Some idiot ran it aground
way back at the start of the Colony years, and the town grew up around the site
to cater for the tourists.'
'Tourists?'
She looked at me. 'It's a big ship.'
I hired an ancient ground car from a seedy-looking dealership two blocks down
from Prescott's office and drove north over the rust-coloured suspension bridge. I
needed time to think. The coastal highway was poorly maintained but almost
deserted so I stuck to the yellow line in the centre of the road and barrelled along
at a steady hundred and fifty. The radio yielded a medley of stations whose
cultural assumptions were largely above my head, but I finally found a NeoMaoist propaganda DJ memory-wired into some dissemination satellite that
nobody had ever bothered to decommission. The mix of high political sentiment
and saccharine karaoke numbers was irresistible. The smell of the passing sea
blew in through the open window and the road unwound ahead of me, and for a

while I forgot about the Corps and Innenin and everything that had happened
since.
By the time I hit the long curve down into Ember, the sun was going down
behind the canted angles of the Free Trade Enforcer's launch deck, and the last
of its rays were leaving almost imperceptible pink stains on the surf on either
side of the wreck's shadow. Prescott was right. It was a big ship.
I slowed my speed in deference to the rise of buildings around me, wondering
idly how anyone could have been stupid enough to steer a vessel that large so
close to shore. Maybe Bancroft knew. He'd probably been around then.
Ember's main street ran along the seafront the entire length of the town and was
separated from the beach by a line of majestic palm trees and a neo-Victorian
railing in wrought iron. There were holograph 'casters fixed to the trunks of the
palms, all projecting the same image of a woman's face wreathed with the words
SLIPSLIDE — ANCHANA SALOMAO & THE RIO TOTAL BODY
THEATRE. Small knots of people were out, rubbernecking at the images.
I rolled the ground car along the street in low gear, scanning the facades, and
finally found what I was looking for about two thirds of the way along the front.
I coasted past and parked the car quietly about fifty metres up, sat still for a few
minutes to see if anything happened and then, when it didn't, I got out of the car
and walked back along the street.
Elliott's Data Linkage broking was a narrow facade sandwiched between an
industrial chemicals outlet and a vacant lot where gulls screeched and fought
over scraps among the shells of discarded hardware. The door of Elliott's was
propped open with a defunct flatscreen monitor and led directly into the
operations room. I stepped inside and cast a glance up and down. There were
four consoles set in back-to-back pairs, harboured behind a long moulded plastic
reception counter. Beyond them, doors led to a glass-walled office. The far wall
held a bank of seven monitors with incomprehensible lines of data scrolling
down. A ragged gap in the line of screens marked the previous position of the
doorstop. There were scars in the paintwork behind where the brackets had
resisted extraction. The screen next to the gap had rolling flickers, as if whatever
had killed the first one was contagious.
'Help you?'

A thin-faced man of indeterminate age poked his head round the corner of one of
the sloping banks of console equipment. There was an unlit cigarette in his
mouth and a trailing thread of cable jacked into an interface behind his right ear.
His skin was unhealthily pale.
'Yeah, I'm looking for Victor Elliott.'
'Out front.' He gestured back the way I had come. 'See the old guy on the rail?
Watching the wreck? That's him.'
I looked out into the evening beyond the door and picked out the solitary figure
at the rail.
'He owns this place, right?'
'Yeah. For his sins.' The datarat cracked a grin and gestured around. 'Not much
call for him to be in the office, business the way it is.'
I thanked him and went back out onto the street. The light was starting to fade
now, and Anchana Salomao's holographic face was gaining a new dominance in
the gathering gloom. Crossing beneath one of the banners, I came up next to the
man on the rail and leaned my own arms on the black iron. He looked round as I
joined him and gave me a nod of acknowledgement, then went back to staring at
the horizon as if he was looking for a crack in the weld between sea and sky.
'That's a pretty grim piece of parking,' I said, gesturing out at the wreck.
It earned me a speculative look before he answered me. 'They say it was
terrorists.' His voice was empty, disinterested, as if he'd once put too much effort
into using it and something had broken. 'Or sonar failure in a storm. Maybe
both.'
'Maybe they did it for the insurance,' I said.
Elliott looked at me again, more sharply. 'You're not from here?' he asked, a
fraction more interest edging his tone this time.
'No. Passing through.'
'From Rio?' He gestured up at Anchana Salomao as he said it. 'You an artist?'

'No.'
'Oh.' He seemed to consider this for a moment. It was as if conversation was a
skill he'd forgotten. 'You move like an artist.'
'Near miss. It's military neurachem.'
He got it then, but the shock didn't seem to go beyond a brief flicker in his eyes.
He looked me up and down slowly, then turned back to the sea.
'You come looking for me? You from Bancroft?'
'You might say that.'
He moistened his lips. 'Come to kill me?'
I took the hardcopy out of my pocket and handed it across to him. 'Come to ask
you some questions. Did you transmit this?'
He read it, lips moving wordlessly. Inside my head, I could hear the words he
was tasting again: . . . for taking my daughter front me . . . will burn the flesh
from your head . . . will never know the hour or the day . . . nowhere safe in this
life . . . It wasn't highly original, but it was heartfelt and articulate in a way that
was more worrying than any of the vitriol Prescott had shown me on the Rabid
& Rambling stack. It also specified exactly the death Bancroft had suffered. The
particle blaster would have charred the outside of Bancroft's skull to a crisp
before exploding the superheated contents across the room.
'Yes, that's mine,' Elliott said quietly.
'You're aware that someone assassinated Laurens Bancroft last month.'
He handed me back the paper. 'That so? The way I heard it, the bastard torched
his own head off.'
'Well, that is a possibility,' I conceded, screwing up the paper and tossing it into a
refuse-filled skip below us on the beach. 'But it's not one I'm being paid to take
seriously. Unfortunately for you, the cause of death comes uncomfortably close
to your prose style there.'

'I didn't do it,' said Elliott flatly.
'I figured you'd say that. I might even believe you, except that whoever did kill
Bancroft got through some very heavy-duty security systems, and you used to be
a sergeant in the tactical marines. Now, I knew some tacs back on Harlan's
World, and a few of them were wired for covert wet work.'
Elliott looked at me curiously. 'You a grasshopper?'
'A what?'
'Grasshopper. Offworlder.'
'Yeah.' If Elliott had ever been afraid of me, it was wearing off fast. I considered
playing the Envoy card, but it didn't seem worth it. The man was still talking.
'Bancroft don't need to bring in muscle from offworld. What's your angle on
this?'
'Private contractor,' I said. 'Find the killer.'
Elliott snorted. 'And you thought it was me.'
I hadn't thought that, but I let it go, because the misconception was giving him a
feeling of superiority that kept the conversation rolling. Something approaching
a spark appeared in his eyes.
'You think I could have got into Bancroft's house? I know I couldn't, because I
ran the specs. If there was any way in, I would have taken it a year ago, and you
would have found little pieces of him scattered on the lawn.'
'Because of your daughter?'
'Yes, because of my daughter.' The anger was fuelling his animation. 'My
daughter and all the others like her. She was only a kid.'
He broke off and stared out to sea again. After a moment, he gestured at the Free
Trade Enforcer, where I could now see small lights glimmering around what
must be a stage set up on the sloping launch deck. 'That was what she wanted.
All she wanted. Total Body Theatre. Be like Anchana Salomao and Rhian Li.

She went to Bay City because she heard there was a connection there, someone
who could — '
He jarred to a halt, and looked at me. The datarat had called him old, and now
for the first time I saw why. In spite of his solid sergeant's bulk and barely
swelling waistline, the face was old, carved in the harsh lines of long-term pain.
He was on the edge of tears.
'She could have made it too. She was beautiful.'
He was fumbling for something in his pocket. I produced my cigarettes and
offered him one. He took it automatically, lit it from the proffered ignition patch
on the packet, but he went on fumbling in his pockets until he'd dug out a small
Kodakristal. I really didn't want to see this, but he activated it before I could say
anything and a tiny cubed image sprang up in the air between us.
He was right. Elizabeth Elliott was a beautiful girl, blonde and athletic and only
a few years younger than Miriam Bancroft. Whether she had the driving
determination and horselike stamina that you needed in Total Body Theatre, the
picture didn't show, but she probably could have given it a shot.
The holoshot showed her sandwiched between Elliott and another woman who
was an almost perfect older edition of Elizabeth. The three of them had been
taken in bright sunlight somewhere with grass, and the picture was marred by a
bar of shadow falling from a tree beyond the cast of the recorder across the older
woman's face. She was frowning, as if she had noticed the flaw in the
composition, but it was a small frown, a fractional chiselling of lines between
her brows. A palpable shimmer of happiness overwhelmed the detail.
'Gone,' said Elliott, as if he had guessed who my attention was focused on. 'Four
years ago. You know what Dipping is?'
I shook my head. Local colour, Virginia Vidaura said in my ear. Soak it up.
Elliott looked up, for a moment I thought at the holo of Anchana Salomao, but
then I saw that his head was tilted at the sky beyond. 'Up there,' he said, and
jarred to a halt the way he had when he mentioned his daughter's youth.
I waited.

'Up there, you got the comsats. Raining data. You can see it on some virtual
maps, it looks like someone's knitting the world a scarf.' He looked down at me
again, eyes shiny. 'Irene said that. Knitting the world a scarf. Some of that scarf
is people. Digitised rich folks, on their way between bodies. Skeins of memory
and feeling and thought, packaged up by numbers.'
Now I thought I knew what was coming, but I kept quiet.
'If you're good, like she was, and you've got the equipment, you can sample
those signals. They call them mindbites. Moments in the head of a fashion-house
princess, the ideas of a particle theorist, memories from a king's childhood.
There's a market for this stuff. Oh, the society magazines run edited skullwalks
of these sorts of people, but it's all authorised, sanitised. Cut for public
consumption. No unguarded moments, nothing that could embarrass anybody or
damage popularity, just great big plastic smiles on everything. That ain't what
people really want.'
I had my doubts about that. The skullwalk magazines were big on Harlan's
World as well, and the only time their consumers protested was when one of the
notables they portrayed was caught in some moment of human weakness.
Infidelity and abusive language were usually the biggest generators of public
outcry. It made sense. Anyone pitiful enough to want to spend so much time
outside their own head wasn't going to want to see the same basic human
realities reflected in the gilded skulls of those they admired.
'With mindbites, you get everything,' said Elliott with a peculiar enthusiasm I
suspected was a graft from his wife's opinions. 'The doubt, the muck, the
humanity. People will pay a fortune for it.'
'But it's illegal?'
Elliott gestured at the shopfront that bore his name. 'The data market was down.
Too many brokers. Saturated. We had a clone and re-sleeving policy to pay on
both of us, plus Elizabeth. My tac pension wasn't going to be enough. What
could we do?'
'How long did she get?' I asked him softly.
Elliott stared out to sea. 'Thirty years.'

After a while, stare still fixed on the horizon, he said, 'I was OK for six months,
then I turn on the screen and see some corporate negotiator wearing Irene's
body.' He half-turned towards me and coughed out something that might have
been a laugh. 'Corporation bought it direct from the Bay City storage facility.
Paid five times what I could have afforded. They say the bitch only wears it
alternate months.'
'Elizabeth know that?'
He nodded once, like an axe coming down. 'She got it out of me, one night. I
was jack-happy. Been cruising the stacks all day, looking for business. No handle
on where I was or what was going on. You want to know what she said?'
'No,' I muttered.
He didn't hear me. His knuckles had whitened on the iron railing. 'She said,
Don't worry Daddy, when I'm rich we'll buy Mummy back.'
This was getting out of hand.
'Look, Elliott, I'm sorry about your daughter, but from what I hear she wasn't
working the kind of places Bancroft goes. Jerry's Closed Quarters isn't exactly
the Houses, is it?'
The ex-tac spun on me without warning, and there was blind murder in his eyes
and his crooked hands. I couldn't blame him. All he could see in front of him
was Bancroft's man.
But you can't jump an Envoy — the conditioning won't let it happen. I saw the
attack coming almost before he knew he was going to do it himself, and I had
the neurachem of my borrowed sleeve online fragments of a second later. He hit
low, driving under the guard he thought I'd put up, looking for the body blows
that would break up my ribs. The guard wasn't there, and neither was I. Instead, I
stepped inside the hooks of his punches, took him off balance with my weight
and tangled one leg amidst his. He stumbled back against the railing and I drove
a cruel elbow uppercut into his solar plexus. His face went grey with the shock.
Leaning over, I pinned him to the rail and jammed the fork of my thumb and
fingers into his throat.
'That's enough,' I snapped, a little unsteadily. The sleeve's neurachem wiring was

a rougher piece of work than the Corps systems I'd used in the past and in overdrive the overwhelming impression was of being slung around in a subcutaneous
bag of chicken wire.
I looked down at Elliott.
His eyes were a hand's breadth from mine, and despite the grip I had on his
throat they were still burning with rage. Breath whistled in his teeth as he clawed
after the strength to break my grip and damage me.
I yanked him off the rail and propped him away from me with a cautionary arm.
'Listen, I'm passing no judgements here. I just want to know. What makes you
think she has any connection to Bancroft?'
'Because she told me, motherfucker.' The sentence hissed out of him. 'She told
me what he'd done.'
'And what was that?'
He blinked rapidly, the undischarged rage condensing into tears. 'Dirty tilings,'
he said. 'She said he needed them. Badly enough to come back. Badly enough to
pay.'
Meal ticket. Don't worry Daddy, when I'm rich we'll buy Mummy back. Easy
enough mistake to make when you're young. But nothing comes that easy.
'You think that's why she died?'
He turned his head and looked at me as if I was a particularly poisonous species
of spider on his kitchen floor.
'She didn't die, mister. Someone killed her. Someone took a razor and cut her up.'
'Trial transcript says it was a client. Not Bancroft.'
'How would they know?' he said dully. 'They name a body, who knows who's
inside it. Who's paying for it all.'
'They find him yet?'

'Biocabin whore's killer? What do you think? It ain't exactly like she worked for
the Houses, right?'
'That's not what I meant, Elliott. You say she turned Bancroft in Jerry's, I'll
believe you. But you've got to admit it doesn't sound like Bancroft's style. I've
met the man, and slumming?' I shook my head. 'He doesn't read that: way to me.'
Elliott turned away.
'Flesh,' he said. 'What you going to read in a Meth's flesh?'
It was nearly full dark. Out across the water on the sloping deck of the warship,
the performance had started. We both stared at the lights for a while, heard the
bright snatches of music, like transmissions from a world that we were forever
locked out of.
'Elizabeth's still on stack,' I said quietly.
'Yeah, so what? Re-sleeving policy lapsed four years ago, when we sank all the
money we had into some lawyer said he could crack Irene's case.' He gestured
back at the dimly lit frontage of his offices. 'I look like the kind of guy's going to
come into some money real soon?'
There was nothing to say after that. I left him watching the lights and walked
back to the car. He was still there when I drove back past him on the way out of
the little town. He didn't look round.

PART 2 : REACTION
(INTRUSION CONFLICT)

CHAPTER NINE

I called Prescott from the car. Her face looked mildly irritated as it scribbled into
focus on the dusty little screen set into the dashboard.
'Kovacs. Did you find what you were looking for?'
'Still don't really know what I'm looking for,' I said cheerfully. 'You think
Bancroft ever does the biocabins?'
She pulled a face. 'Oh, please.'
'All right, here's another one. Did Leila Begin ever work biocabin joints?'
'I really have no idea, Kovacs.'
'Well, look it up then. I'll hold.' My voice came out stony. Prescott's well-bred
distaste wasn't sitting too well beside Victor Elliott's anguish for his daughter.
I drummed my fingers on the wheel while the lawyer went off-screen and found
myself muttering a Millsport fisherman's rap to the rhythm. Outside the coast
slid by in the night, but the scents and sounds of the sea were suddenly all
wrong. Too muted, not a trace of belaweed on the wind.
'Here we are.' Prescott settled herself back within range of the phone scanner,
looking slightly uncomfortable. 'Begin's Oakland records show two stints in

biocabins, before she got tenure in one of the San Diego Houses. She must have
had an entrйe, unless it was a talent scout that spotted her.'
Bancroft would have been quite an entree to anywhere. I resisted the temptation
to say it.
'You got an image there?'
'Of Begin?' Prescott shrugged. 'Only a two-d. You want me to send it.'
'Please.'
The ancient earphone fizzled a bit as it adjusted to the change of incoming
signal, and then Leila Begin's features emerged from the static. I leaned closer,
scanning them for the truth. It took a moment or two to find, but it was there.
'Right. Now can you get me the address of that place Elizabeth Elliott worked.
Jerry's Closed Quarters. It's on a street called Mariposa.'
'Mariposa and San Bruno,' Prescott's disembodied voice came back from behind
Leila Begin's full service pout. 'Jesus, it's right under the old expressway. That's
got to be a safety violation.'
'Can you send me a map, route marked through from the bridge.'
'You're going there? Tonight?'
'Prescott, these places don't do a lot of business during the day,' I said patiently.
'Of course I'm going there tonight.'
There was a slight hesitation on the other end of the line.
'It's not a recommended area, Kovacs. You need to be careful.'
This time I couldn't be bothered to stifle the snort of amusement. It was like
listening to someone tell a surgeon to be careful and not get his hands bloody.
She must have heard me.
'I'm sending the map,' she said stiffly.
Leila Begin's face blinked out and a tracery of grid-patterned streets inked

themselves into the place she had been. I didn't need her any more. Her hair had
been iridescent crimson, her throat choked with a steel collar and her eyes made
up with startle lines, but it was the lines of the face below it all that stayed with
me. The same lines faintly emergent in Victor Elliott's Kodakristal of his
daughter. The understated but undeniable similarity.
Miriam Bancroft.

There was rain in the air when I got back to the city, a fine drizzle sifting down
from the darkened sky. Parked across the street from Jerry's, I watched the
blinking neon club sign through the streaks and beads of water on the windscreen of the ground car. Somewhere in the gloom below the concrete bones of
the expressway a holo of a woman danced in a cocktail glass, but there was a
fault in the 'caster and the image kept fizzling out.
I'd been worried about the ground car drawing attention, but it seemed that I'd
come to the right part of town with it. Most of the vehicles around Jerry's were
flightless; the only exceptions to the rule were the autocabs that occasionally
spiralled down to disgorge or collect passengers and then sprang back up into the
aerial traffic flow with inhuman accuracy and speed. With their arrays of red,
blue and white navigation lights they seemed like jewelled visitors from another
world, barely touching the cracked and litter-strewn paving while their charges
alighted or climbed aboard.
I watched for an hour. The club did brisk business, varied clientele but mostly
male. They were checked at the door by a security robot that resembled nothing
so much as a concertina'd octopus strung from the lintel of the main entrance.
Some had to divest themselves of concealed items, presumably weapons, and
one or two were turned away. There were no protests — you can't argue with a
robot. Outside, people parked, climbed in and out of cars and did deals with
merchandise too small to make out at this distance. Once, two men started a
knife fight in the shadows between two of the expressway's support pillars, but it
didn't come to much. One combatant limped off, clutching a slashed arm, and the
other returned to the club's interior as if he'd done no more than go out to relieve
himself.
I climbed out of the car, made sure it was alarmed, and wandered across the

street. A couple of the dealers were seated cross-legged on the hood of a car,
shielded from the rain by a static repulsion unit set up between their feet, and
they glanced up as I approached.
'Sell you a disc, man? Hot spinners out of Ulan Bator, House quality.'
I gave them one smooth sweep, shook my head unhurriedly.
'Stiff?'
Another shake. I reached the robot, paused as its multiple arms snaked down to
frisk me, then tried to walk over the threshold as the cheap synth voice said
'clear'. One of the arms prodded me gently back at chest height.
'Do you want cabins or bar?'
I hesitated, pretending to weigh it up. 'What's the deal in the bar?'
'Ha ha ha.' Someone had programmed a laugh into the robot. It sounded like a fat
man drowning in syrup. It cut off abruptly. 'The bar is look, but don't touch. No
money down, no hands on. House rule. That applies to other customers too.'
'Cabins,' I said, anxious to get away from the mechanical barker's software. The
street dealers on the car had been positively warm by comparison.
'Down the stairs, to the left. Take a towel from the pile.'
I went down the short metal-railed flight and turned left along a corridor lit from
the ceiling by rotating red lights like the ones on the autocabs outside. Incessant
junk rhythm music thrashed the air as if this was the ventricle of some massive
heart on tetrameth. As promised, there was a pile of fresh white towels in an
alcove and beyond it the doors to the cabins. I walked past the first four, two of
which were occupied, and stepped into the fifth.
The floor was satin-sheened padding, about two metres by three. If it was
stained, it didn't show because the only illumination came from a single rotating
cherry like the ones in the corridor. The air was warm and stale. Under the
sweeping shadows cast by the light a battered-looking credit console stood in
one corner, stalk painted matt black, red LED digital display at the top. There
was a slot for cards and cash. No pad for DNA credit. The far wall was frosted

glass.
I'd seen this one coming and drawn a sheaf of currency through an autobank on
the way down through the city. I selected one of the large denomination
plastified notes and fed it into the slot. Punched the commence button. My credit
flashed up in LED red. The door hinged smoothly shut behind me, muffling the
music, and a body thudded against the frosted glass ahead with an abruptness
that made me twitch. The display digits flickered to life. Minimal expenditure so
far. I studied the body pressed against the glass. Heavy breasts pressed flat, a
woman's profile and the indistinct lines of hips and thighs. Piped moaning came
softly through hidden speakers. A voice gusted.
'Do you want to see me see me see me . . . ?'
Cheap echo box on the vocoder.
I pressed the button again. The glass unfrosted and the woman on the other side
became visible. She shifted, side to side, showing herself to me, worked out
body, augmented breasts, leaned forward and licked the glass with the tip of her
tongue, breath misting it again. Her eyes locked onto mine.
'Do you want to touch me touch me touch me . . . ?'
Whether the cabins used subsonics or not, I was getting a definite reaction from
it all. My penis thickened and stirred. I locked down the throbbing, forced the
blood back out and into my muscles the way a combat call would do. I needed to
be limp for this scene. I reached for the debit button again. The glass screen slid
aside and she stepped through, like someone coming out of a shower. She moved
up to me, one hand slid out, cupping.
'Tell me what you want, honey,' she said from somewhere in the base of her
throat. The voice seemed hard edged, deprived of the vocoder effect.
I cleared my own. 'What's your name?'
'Anenome. Want to know why they call me that?'
Her hand worked. Behind her, the meter was clicking over softly.
'You remember a girl used to work here?' I asked.

She was working on my belt now. 'Honey, any girl used to work here ain't going
to do for you what I am. Now, how would you — '
'She was called Elizabeth. Her real name. Elizabeth Elliott.'
Her hands fell abruptly away, and the mask of arousal slid off her face as if it
was greased underneath.
'What the fuck is this? You the Sia?'
'The what?'
'Sia. The heat.' Her voice was rising. She stepped away from me. 'We had this,
man — '
'No.' I took a step towards her and she dropped into a competent-looking
defensive crouch. I backed up again, voice low. 'No, I'm her mother.'
Taut silence. She glared at me.
'Bullshit. Lizzie's ma's in the store.'
'No.' I pulled her hand back to my groin. 'Feel. There's nothing there. They
sleeved me in this, but I'm a woman. I don't, I couldn't . . . '
She unbent fractionally from her crouch, hands tugging down almost
unwillingly. 'That looks like prime tank flesh to me,' she said untrustingly. 'You
just come out of the store, how come you're not paroled in some bonebag
junkie's sleeve?'
'It's not parole.' The Corps' deep-cover training came rocketing in across my
mind like a flight of low-level strike jets, spinning vapour-trail lies on the edge
of plausibility and half-known detail. Something inside me tilted with the joy of
mission time. 'You know what I went down for?'
'Lizzie said mindbites, something — '
'Yeah. Dipping. You know who I Dipped?'
'No. Lizzie never talked much about — '

'Elizabeth didn't know. And it never came out on the wires.'
The heavy-breasted girl put her hands on her hips. 'So who — '
I skinned her a smile. 'Better you don't know. Someone powerful. Someone with
enough pull to unstack me, and give me this.'
'Not powerful enough to get you back in something with a pussy, though.'
Anenome's voice was still doubtful, but the conviction was coming up fast, like a
bottleback school under reef water. She wanted to believe this fairytale mother
come looking for her lost daughter. 'How come you're cross-sleeved?'
'There's a deal,' I told her, gliding near the truth to flesh out the story. 'This . . .
person . . . gets me out, and I have to do something for them. Something that
needs a man's body. If I do it, I get a new sleeve for me and Elizabeth.'
'That so? So why you here?' There was an edge of bitterness in her voice that
told me her parents would never come to this place looking for her. And that she
believed me. I laid the last pieces of the lie.
'There's a problem with re-sleeving Elizabeth. Someone's blocking the
procedure. I want to know who it is, and why. You know who cut her up?'
She shook her head, face turned down.
'A lot of the girls get hurt,' she said quietly. 'But Jerry's got insurance to cover
that. He's real good about it, even puts us into store if it's going to take a long
time to heal. But whoever did Lizzie wasn't a regular.'
'Did Elizabeth have regulars? Anyone important? Anyone strange?'
She looked up at me, pity showing in the corners of her eyes. I'd played Irene
Elliott to the hilt. 'Mrs Elliott, all the people who come here are strange. They
wouldn't be here if they weren't.'
I made myself wince. 'Anyone. Important?'
'I don't know. Look, Mrs Elliott, I liked Lizzie, she was real kind to me a coupla
times when I got down, but we never got close. She was close with Chloe and . .
. ' She paused, and added hurriedly, 'Nothing like that, you know, but her and

Chloe, and Mac, they used to share things, you know, talk and everything.'
'Can I talk to them?'
Her eyes flickered to the corners of the cabin, as if she had just heard an
inexplicable noise. She looked hunted.
'It's better if you. Don't. Jerry, you know, he doesn't like us talking to the public.
If he catches us . . . '
I put every ounce of Envoy persuasiveness into stance and tone. 'Well, maybe
you could ask for me . . . '
The hunted look deepened, but her voice firmed up.
'Sure. I'll ask around. But not. Not now. You've got to go. Come back tomorrow
the same time. Same cabin. I'll stay free for this time. Say you made an
appointment.'
I took her hand in both of mine. 'Thank you, Anenome.'
'My name's not Anenome,' she said abruptly. 'I'm called Louise. Call me Louise.'
'Thank you, Louise.' I held on to her hand. 'Thank you for doing this — '
'Look, I'm not promising anything,' she said with an attempt at roughness. 'Like I
said, I'll ask. That's all. Now, you go. Please.'
She showed me how to cancel the remainder of my payment on the credit
console, and the door hinged immediately open. No change. I didn't say anything
else. I didn't try to touch her again. I walked out through the open door and left
her standing there with her arms wrapped around her chest and her head down,
staring at the satin-padded floor of the cabin as if she was seeing it for the first
time.
Lit in red.

Outside, the street was unchanged. The two dealers were still there, deep in

negotiations with a huge Mongol who was leaning on the hood of the car,
looking at something between his hands. The octopus arched its arms to let me
pass and I stepped into the drizzle. The Mongol looked up as I passed and a
flinch of recognition passed over his face.
I stopped, turning in mid-step, and he dropped his gaze again, muttering
something to the dealers. The neurachem came online like a shiver of cold water
inside. I moved across the space to the car, and the sparse conversation between
the three men dried up instantly. Hands slid into pouches and pockets.
Something was pushing me, something that had very little to do with the look
the Mongol had given me. Something dark that had spread its wings on the lowkey misery of the cabin, something uncontrolled that Virginia Vidaura would
have bawled me out for. I could hear Jimmy de Soto whispering in my ear.
'You waiting for me?' I asked the Mongol's back, and saw how the muscles in it
tensed.
Maybe one of the dealers felt it coming. He held up his exposed hand in a
placatory gesture. 'Look, man,' he began weakly.
I sliced him a glance out of the corner of my eye and he shut up.
'I said — '
That was when it all came apart. The Mongol pushed himself off the car hood
with a roar and swatted at me with an arm the size of a ham. The blow never
landed, but even deflecting it, I staggered back a pace. The dealers skinned their
weapons, deadly little slabs of black and grey metal that spat and yapped in the
rain. I twisted away from the traceries of fire, using the Mongol for cover, and
shot a palm heel into his contorted face. Bone crunched and I came round him
onto the car while the dealers were still trying to work out where I was. The
neurachem made their movements into the pouring of thick honey. One gunfilled fist came tracking towards me and I smashed the fingers around the metal
with a sideflung kick. The owner howled, and the edge of my hand cracked into
the other dealer's temple. Both men reeled off the car, one still moaning, the
other insensible or dead. I came up into a crouch.
The Mongol took off, running.
I vaulted the roof of the ground car and went after him without thinking. The

concrete jarred my feet as I landed, sent splinters of pain lancing up both shins,
but the neurachem damped it down instantly and I was only a dozen metres
behind. I threw out my chest and sprinted.
Ahead of me, the Mongol bounced around in my field of vision like a combat jet
trying to elude pursuing fire. For a man of his size, he was remarkably fast,
flitting between the marching support pillars of the expressway and into the
shadows a good twenty metres ahead now. I put on speed, wincing at the sharp
pains in my chest. Rain slapped at my face.
Fucking cigarettes.
We came out from under the pillars and across a deserted intersection where the
traffic lights leaned at drunken angles. One of them stirred feebly, lights changing, as the Mongol passed it. A senile robot voice husked out at me. Cross now.
Cross now. Cross now. I already had. The echoes followed me beseechingly up
the street.
Past the derelict hulks of vehicles that hadn't moved from their kerbside resting
places in years. Barred and shuttered frontages that might or might not be rolled
up for business during daylight hours, steam rising from a grate in the side of the
street like something alive. The paving under my feet was slick with the rain and
a grey muck distilled from items of decaying garbage. The shoes that had come
with Bancroft's summer suit were thin-soled and devoid of useful grip. Only the
perfect balance of the neurachem kept me upright.
The Mongol cast a glance back over his shoulder as he came level with two
parked wrecks, saw I was still there and broke left across the street as soon as he
cleared the last vehicle. I tried to adjust my trajectory and cut him off, crossing
the street at an angle before I reached the wrecked cars, but my quarry had timed
the trap too well. I was already on the first wreck, and I skidded trying to stop in
time. I bounced off the hood of the rusting vehicle into a shopfront shutter. The
metal clanged and sizzled; a low-current anti-loitering charge stung my hands.
Across the street, the Mongol stretched the distance between us by another ten
metres.
A wayward speck of traffic moved in the sky above me.
I spotted the fleeing figure on the other side of the street and kicked off from the
kerb, cursing the impulse that had made me turn down Bancroft's offer of

armaments. At this range a beam weapon would have carved the Mongol's legs
out from under him easily. Instead, I tucked in behind him and tried to find the
lung capacity from somewhere to close up the gap again. Maybe I could panic
him into tripping.
That wasn't what happened, but it was close enough. The buildings to our left
gave way to waste ground bordered by a sagging fence. The Mongol looked
back again and made his first mistake. He stopped, threw himself on the fence,
which promptly collapsed, and scrambled over into the darkness beyond. I
grinned and followed. Finally, I had the advantage.
Perhaps he was hoping to lose himself in the darkness, or expecting me to twist
an ankle over the uneven ground. But the Envoy conditioning squeezed my
pupils into instant dilation in the low-light surroundings and mapped my steps
over the uneven surface with lightning speed, and the neurachem put my feet
there with a rapidity to match. The ground ghosted by beneath me the way it had
beneath Jimmy de Soto in my dream. Given a hundred metres of this I was going
to overtake my Mongol friend, unless he too had augmented vision.
In the event, the waste ground ran out before that, but by then there was barely
the original dozen metres between us when we both hit the fence on the far side.
He scaled the wire, dropped to the ground and started up the street while I was
still climbing, but then, abruptly, he appeared to stumble. I cleared the top of the
fence and swung down lightly. He must have heard me drop though, because he
spun out of the huddle, still not finished with clipping together the thing in his
hands. The muzzle came up and I dived for the street.
I hit hard, skinning my hands and rolling. Lightning torched the night where I
had been. The stink of ozone washed over me and the crackle of disrupted air
curled in my ears. I kept rolling and the particle blaster lit up again, charring past
my shoulder. The damp street hissed with steam in its wake. I scrambled for
cover that wasn't there.
'LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPON!'
A cluster of pulsating lights dropped vertically from above and the tannoy
barked down the night like the voice of a robot god. A searchlight exploded in
the street and flooded us with white fire. From where I lay, I screwed up my eyes
and could just make out the police transport, a regulation crowd-control five

metres off the street, lights flashing. The soft storm of its turbines swept flapping
wings of paper and plastic up against the walls of nearby buildings and pinned
them there like dying moths.
'STAND WHERE YOU ARE!' the tannoy thundered again. 'LAY DOWN
YOUR WEAPON!'
The Mongol brought his particle blaster round in a searing arc and the transport
bucked as its pilot tried to avoid the beam. Sparks showered off one turbine
where the weapon found its mark and the transport sideslipped badly. Machinerifle fire answered from a mounting somewhere below the vessel's nose, but by
that time the Mongol was across the street, had torched down a door and was
gone through the smoking gap.
Screams from somewhere within.
I picked myself slowly up off the ground and watched as the transport settled to
within a metre of the ground. An extinguisher canister fumed into life on the
smouldering engine canopy and dripped white foam onto the street. Just behind
the pilot's window, a hatch whined up and Kristin Ortega stood framed in the
opening.

CHAPTER TEN

The transport was a stripped-down version of the one that had given me the ride
out to Suntouch House, and it was noisy in the cabin. Ortega had to shout to
make herself heard above the engines.
'We'll put in a sniffer squad, but if he's connected he can get stuff that'll change
his body's chemical signature before dawn. After that, we're down to witness
sightings. Stone Age stuff. And in this part of town . . . '
The transport banked and she gestured down at the warren of streets below.
'Look at it. Licktown, they call it. Used to be called Potrero way back. They say
it was a nice area.'
'So what happened?'
Ortega shrugged in her steel lattice seat. 'Economic crisis. You know how it is.
One day you own a house, your sleeve policy's paid up, the next you're on the
street looking at a single lifespan.'
'That's tough.'
'Yeah, isn't it,' said the detective dismissively. 'Kovacs, what the fuck were you
doing at Jerry's?'
'Getting an itch scratched,' I growled. 'Any laws against it?'

She looked at me. 'You weren't getting greased in Jerry's. You were barely in
there ten minutes.'
I lifted my own shoulders and made an apologetic face. 'You ever been
downloaded into a male body straight out of the tank, you'll know what it's like.
Hormones. Things get rushed. Places like Jerry's, performance isn't an issue.'
Ortega's lips curved in something approximating a smile. She leaned forward
across the space between us.
'Bullshit, Kovacs. Bull. Shit. I accessed what they've got on you at Millsport.
Psychological profile. They call it the Kemmerich gradient, and yours is so steep
you'd need pitons and rope to get up it. Everything you do, performance is going
to be an issue.'
'Well.' I fed myself a cigarette and ignited it as I spoke. 'You know there's a lot
you can do for some women in ten minutes.'
Ortega rolled her eyes and waved the comment away as if it was a fly buzzing
around her face.
'Right. And you're telling me with the credit you have from Bancroft, Jerry's is
the best you can afford?'
'It's not about cost,' I said, and wondered if that was the truth of what brought
people like Bancroft down to Licktown.
Ortega leaned her head against the window and looked out at the rain. She didn't
look at me. 'You're chasing leads, Kovacs. You went down to Jerry's to follow up
something Bancroft did there. Given time I can find out what that was, but it'd be
easier if you just told me.'
'Why? You told me the Bancroft case was closed. What's your interest?'
That brought her eyes back round to mine, and there was a light in them. 'My
interest is keeping the peace. Maybe you haven't noticed, but every time we meet
it's to the sound of heavy-calibre gunfire.'
I spread my hands. 'I'm unarmed. All I'm doing is asking questions. And
speaking of questions . . . How come you were sitting on my shoulder when the

fan started?'
'Just lucky, I guess.'
I let that one go. Ortega was tailing me, that much was certain. And that in turn
meant there had to be more to the Bancroft case than she was admitting.
'What's going to happen to my car?' I asked.
'We'll have it picked up. Notify the hire company. Someone can come and get it
from the impound. Unless you want it.'
I shook my head.
'Tell me something, Kovacs. Why'd you hire a ground car? On what Bancroft's
paying you, you could have had one of these.' She slapped the bulkhead by her
side.
'I like to go places on the ground,' I said. 'You get a better sense of distance that
way. And on Harlan's World, we don't go up in the air much.'
'Really?'
'Really. Listen, the guy who nearly torched you out of the sky back there — '
'Excuse me?' She cranked up one eyebrow in what by now I was beginning to
think of as her trademark expression. 'Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we
saved your sleeve back there. You were the one looking down the wrong end of
the hardware.'
I gestured. 'Whatever. He was waiting for me.'
'Waiting for you?' Whatever she really thought, Ortega's face was disbelieving.
'According to those Stiff dealers we loaded into the wagon, he was buying
product. An old customer, they say.'
I shook my head. 'He was waiting for me. I went to talk to him, he took off.'
'Maybe he didn't like your face. One of the dealers, I think it was the one whose
skull you cracked, said you were looking jacked up to kill someone.' She

shrugged again. 'They say you started it, and it certainly looks that way.'
'In that case, why aren't you charging me?'
'Oh, with what?' She exhaled an imaginary plume of smoke. 'Organic damage
(surgery reparable) to a pair of Stiff peddlers? Endangering police property?
Breach of the peace in Licktown. Give me a break, Kovacs. This sort of thing
goes down every night outside Jerry's. I'm too tired for the paperwork.'
The transport tipped and through the window I could see the dim form of the
Hendrix's tower. I'd accepted Ortega's offer of a ride home in much the same
spirit as I had the police lift out to Suntouch House — to see where it would take
me. Envoy wisdom. Go with the flow, and see what it shows you. I'd no reason
to suppose Ortega was lying to me about our destination, but still part of me was
surprised to see that tower. Envoys aren't big on trust.
After an initial wrangle with the Hendrix about landing permission, the pilot set
us down on a grimy-looking drop pad atop the tower. I could feel the wind
tugging at the transport's lightweight body as we landed, and as the hatch
unfolded upwards, the cold came battering aboard. I got up to go. Ortega stayed
where she was, watching me go with a lopsided look that I still couldn't work
out. The charge I'd felt last night was back. I could feel the need to say
something pressing on me like an impending sneeze.
'Hey, how'd the bust go down on Kadmin?'
She shifted in the seat and stuck out one long leg to rest her boot on the chair I
had just vacated. A thin smile.
'Grinding through the machine,' she said. 'We'll get there.'
'Good.' I climbed out into the wind and rain, raising my voice. 'Thanks for the
lift.'
She nodded gravely, then tipped her head back to say something to the pilot
behind her. The whine of the turbines built and I ducked hurriedly out from
under the hatch as it began to close. As I stepped back, the transport unglued
itself and lifted away, lights flashing. I caught a final glimpse of Ortega's face
through the rain-streaked cabin window, then the wind seemed to carry the little
craft away like an autumn leaf, wheeling away and down towards the streets

below. In seconds it was indistinguishable from the thousands of other flyers
speckling the night sky. I turned and walked against the wind to the drop pad's
access staircase. My suit was sodden from the rain. What had possessed Bancroft
to outfit me for summer with the scrambled weather systems that Bay City had
so far exhibited was beyond me. On Harlan's World, when it's winter, it stays
that way long enough for you to make decisions about your wardrobe.
The upper levels of the Hendrix were in darkness relieved only by the occasional
glow of dying illuminum tiles, but the hotel obligingly lit my way with neon
tubes that flickered on in my path and died out again behind me. It was a weird
effect, making me feel as if I was carrying a candle or torch.
'You have a visitor,' the hotel said chattily as I got into the elevator and the doors
whirred closed.
I slammed my hand against the emergency stop button, raw flesh stinging where
I'd skinned my palm. 'What?'
'You have a visi — '
'Yeah, I heard.' It occurred to me, briefly, to wonder if the AI could take offence
at my tone. 'Who is it, and where are they?'
'She identifies herself as Miriam Bancroft. Subsequent search of the city archives
has confirmed sleeve identity. I have allowed her to wait in your room, since she
is unarmed and you left nothing of consequence there this morning. Aside from
refreshment, she has touched nothing.'
Feeling my temper rising, I found focus on a small dent in the metal of the
elevator door and made an attempt at calm.
'This is interesting. Do you make arbitrary decisions like this for all your guests?'
'Miriam Bancroft is the wife of Laurens Bancroft,' said the hotel reproachfully.
'Who in turn is paying for your room. Under the circumstances, I thought it wise
not to create unnecessary tensions.'
I looked up at the ceiling of the elevator.
'You been checking up on me?'

'A background check is part of the contract I operate under. Any information
retained is wholly confidential, unless subpoenaed under UN directive 231.4.'
'Yeah? So what else you know?'
'Lieutenant Takeshi Lev Kovacs,' said the hotel. 'Also known as Mamba Lev,
One Hand Rending, the Icepick, born Newpest, Harlan's World 35th May 187,
colonial reckoning. Recruited to UN Protectorate forces 11th September 204,
selected for Envoy Corps enhancement 31st June 211 during routine screening
—'
'All right.' Inwardly I was a little surprised at how deep the AI had got. Most
people's records dry up as soon as the trace goes offworld. Interstellar
needlecasts are expensive. Unless the Hendrix had just broken into Warden
Sullivan's records, which was illegal. Ortega's comment about the hotel's
previous charge sheet drifted back to me. What kind of crimes did an AI commit
anyway?
'It also occurred to me that Mrs Bancroft is probably here in connection with the
matter of her husband's death, which you are investigating. I thought you would
prefer to speak to her if possible, and she was not amenable to waiting in the
lobby.'
I sighed, and unpinned my hand from the elevator's stop button.
'No, I bet she wasn't.'
She was seated in the window, nursing a tall, ice-filled glass and watching the
lights of the traffic below. The room was in darkness broken only by the soft
glow of the service hatch and the tricoloured neon-frame drinks cabinet. Enough
to see that she wore some kind of shawl over work trousers and a body-moulded
leotard. She didn't turn her head when I let myself in, so I advanced across the
room into her field of vision.
'The hotel told me you were here,' I said. 'In case you were wondering why I
didn't unsleeve myself in shock.'
She looked up at me and shook hair back from her face
'Very dry, Mr Kovacs. Should I applaud?'

I shrugged. 'You might say thank you for the drink.'
She examined the top of her glass thoughtfully for a moment, then flicked her
eyes up again.
'Thank you for the drink.'
'Don't mention it.' I went to the cabinet and surveyed the bottles racked there. A
bottle of fifteen-year-old single malt suggested itself. I uncorked it, sniffed at the
neck of the bottle and picked out a tumbler. Keeping my eyes on my hands as
they poured, I said, 'Have you been waiting long?'
'About an hour. Oumou Prescott told me you'd gone to Licktown, so I guessed
you'd be back late. Did you have some trouble?'
I held onto the first of mouthful of whisky, felt it sear the internal cuts where
Kadmin had put the boot in and swallowed hastily. I grimaced.
'Now why would you think that, Mrs Bancroft?'
She made an elegant gesture with one hand. 'No reason. Do you not want to talk
about it?'
'Not particularly.' I sank into a huge lounger bag at the foot of the crimson bed
and sat staring across the room at her. Silence descended. From where I was
sitting she was backlit by the window and her face was deep in shadow. I kept
my eyes levelled on the faint gleam that might have been her left eye. After a
while she shifted in her seat and the ice in her glass clicked.
'Well.' She cleared her throat. 'What would you like to talk about?'
I waved my glass at her. 'Let's start with why you're here.'
'I want to know what progress you've made.'
'You can get a progress report from me tomorrow morning. I'll file one with
Oumou Prescott before I go out. Come on, Mrs Bancroft. It's late. You can do
better than that.'
For a moment I thought she might leave, the way she twitched. But then she took

her glass in both hands, bent her head over it as if in search of inspiration and
after a long moment looked up again.
'I want you to stop,' she said.
I let the words sink into the darkened room.
'Why?'
I saw her lips part in the smile, heard the sound her mouth made as it split.
'Why not?' she said.
'Well.' I sipped at my drink, sluicing the alcohol around the cuts in my mouth to
shut down my hormones. 'To begin with, there's your husband. He's made it
pretty clear that cutting and running could seriously damage my health, Then
there's the hundred thousand dollars. And after that, well, then we get into the
ethereal realm of things like promises and my word. And to be honest, I'm
curious.'
'A hundred thousand isn't so much money,' she said carefully. 'And the
Protectorate is big. I could give you the money. Find a place for you to go where
Laurens would never find you.'
'Yes. That leaves my word, and my curiosity.'
She sat forward over her drink. 'Let's not pretend, Mr Kovacs. Laurens didn't
contract you, he dragged you here. He locked you into a deal you had no choice
but to accept. No one could say you were honour bound.'
'I'm still curious.'
'Maybe I could satisfy that,' she said softly.
I swallowed more whisky. 'Yeah? Did you kill your husband, Mrs Bancroft?'
She made an impatient gesture. 'I'm not talking about your game of detectives.
You are . . . curious about other things, are you not?'
'I'm sorry?' I looked at her over the rim of my glass.

Miriam Bancroft pushed herself off the window shelf and set her hips against it.
She set down the glass with exaggerated care and leaned back on her hands so
that her shoulders lifted. It changed the shape of her breasts, moving them
beneath the sheer material of her leotard.
'Do you know what Merge Nine is?' she asked, a little unsteadily.
'Empathin?' I dug the name out from somewhere. Some thoroughly armed
robbery crew I knew back on Harlan's World, friends of Virginia Vidaura's. The
Little Blue Bugs. They did all their work on Merge Nine. Said it welded them
into a tighter team. Bunch of fucking psychos.
'Yes, empathin. Empathin derivatives, tailed with Satyron and Ghedin enhancers.
This sleeve . . . ' She gestured down at herself, spread fingers brushing the
curves. 'This is state-of-the-art biochemtech, out of the Nakamura Labs. I secrete
Merge Nine, when . . . aroused. In my sweat, in my saliva, in my cunt, Mr
Kovacs.'
And she came off the shelf, shawl sliding off her shoulders to the floor. It
puddled silkenly around her feet and she stepped over it towards me.
Well, there's Alain Marriott, honourable and strong in all his myriad experia
incarnations; and then there's reality. In reality, and whatever it costs, there are
some things you don't turn away from.
I met her halfway across the room. Merge Nine was already in the air, in the
scent of her body and the water vapour on her breath. I drew in a deep breath and
felt the chemical triggers go off like plucked strings in the pit of my stomach.
My drink was gone, set aside somewhere, and the hand that had held it was
moulded around one of Miriam Bancroft's jutting breasts. She drew my head
down with hands on either side and I found it there again, Merge Nine in the
beads of sweat webbed in the soft down that ran in a line down her cleavage. I
tugged at the seam of the leotard, untrapping the breasts pressed beneath it,
tracing and finding one nipple with my mouth.
Above me I felt her mouth gasp open, and knew the empathin was working its
way into my sleeve's brain, tripping dormant telepath instincts and sending out
feelers for the intense aura of arousal that this woman was generating. Knew as
well that she would be beginning to taste the flesh of her own breast in my
mouth. Once triggered, the empathin rush was like a volleyed tennis ball,

building intensity with every rebound from one inflamed sensorium to the other,
until the merge reached a climax just short of unbearable.
Miriam Bancroft was beginning to moan now, as we sank to the floor and I
moved back and forth between her breasts, rubbing their springy resistance over
my face. Her hands had turned hungry, grasping and digging softly with nails at
my flanks and the swollen ache between my legs. We scrabbled feverishly at
each other's clothing, mouths trembling with the need to fill themselves, and
when we had shed everything we wore the rug beneath us seemed to lay
individual strands of heat on our skin. I settled over her and my stubble rasped
faintly over the sprung smoothness of her belly, my mouth making wet Os on its
path downward. Then there was the deep salt taste as my tongue tracked down
the creases of her cunt, soaking up Merge Nine with her juices and coming back
to press and flick at the tiny bud of her clitoris. Somewhere, at the other end of
the world, my penis was pulsing in her hand. A mouth closed over the head, and
sucked gently.
Blending, our climaxes built rapidly and with unerring concurrence, and the
mixed signals of the Merge Nine union blurred until I could find no distinction
between the excruciating tautness of the prick between her fingers and the
pressure of my own tongue somewhere indistinct up beyond its feasible reach
inside her. Her thighs clamped around my head. There was a grunting sound, but
whose throat it came from I was no longer aware. Separateness melted away into
mutual sensory overload, tension building layer after layer, peak after peak, and
then suddenly she was laughing at the warm, salty splash over her face and
fingers and I was clamped against her corkscrewing hips as her own
simultaneous crest swept her away.
For a while there was trembling release, in which the slightest movement, the
sliding of flesh against flesh brought sobbing spasms from us both. Then, gift of
the long period my sleeve had been in the tank, the sweaty images of Anenome
pressed against the glass of the bio-cabin, my penis twitched and began to
tighten again. Miriam Bancroft nudged at it with her nose, ran the tip of her
tongue along and around it, licking off the stickiness until it was smooth and taut
against her cheek, then swung around and straddled me. Reaching back for
balance and hold, she sank down, impaling herself on the shaft with a long,
warm groan. She leaned over me, breasts swinging, and I craned and sucked
hungrily at the elusive globes. My hands came up to grasp her thighs where they
were spread on either side of my body.

And then the motion.
The second time took longer, and the empathin lent it an air that was more
aesthetic than sexual. Taking her cue from the signals gusting out of my
sensorium, Miriam Bancroft settled into a slow churning motion while I watched
her taut belly and outthrust breasts with detached lust. For no reason I could
discern, the Hendrix piped a slow, deep ragga beat in from the corners of the
room, and a lighting effect patterned the ceiling above us with swirling blotches
of red and purple. When the effect tilted and the swirling stars came to dapple
our bodies, I felt my mind tilting with it and my perceptions slid sideways out of
focus. There was only the grinding of Miriam Bancroft's hips over me, and
fragmented glimpses of her body and face wrapped in coloured light. When I
came, it was a distant explosion that seemed to have more to do with the woman
shuddering to a halt astride me than with my own sleeve.
Later, as we lay side by side, hands milking each other through further
inconclusive peaks and troughs, she said, 'What do you think of me?'
I looked down the length of my body to what her hand was doing, and cleared
my throat.
'Is that a trick question?'
She laughed, the same throaty cough that I had warmed to in the chart room at
Suntouch House.
'No. I want to know.'
'Do you care?' It was not said harshly, and somehow the Merge Nine leached it
of its brutal overtones.
'You think that's what it is to be a Meth?' The word sounded strange on her lips,
as though she were not talking about herself. 'You think we don't care about
anything young?'
'I don't know,' I said truthfully. 'It's a point of view that I've heard. Living three
hundred years is bound to change your perspectives.'
'Yes, it does.' Her breath caught slightly as my fingers slid inside her. 'Yes, like
that. But you don't stop caring. You see it. All sliding past you. And all you want

to do is grab on, hold on to something, to stop it all. Draining away.'
'Is that right?'
'Yes, it is. So what do you think of me?'
I leaned over her and looked at the young woman's body she inhabited, the fine
lines of her face and the old, old eyes. I was still stoned on the Merge Nine, and I
couldn't find a flaw anywhere in her. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever
seen. I gave up the struggle for objectivity and bowed my head to kiss her on one
breast.
'Miriam Bancroft, you are a wonder to behold, and I would willingly trade my
soul to possess you.'
She staved off a chuckle. 'I'm serious. Do you like me?'
'What kind of a question — '
'I'm serious.' The words were grounded deeper than the einpathin. I pulled in
some control and looked her in the eyes.
'Yes,' I said simply. 'I like you.'
Her voice lowered into her throat. 'Do you like what we did?'
'Yes, I like what we did.'
'Do you want more?'
'Yes, I want more.'
She sat up to face me. The milking motions of her hand grew harder, more
demanding. Her voice hardened to match. 'Say it again.'
'I want more. Of you.'
She pushed me down with a hand flat on my chest and leaned over me. I was
growing back to somewhere near a full erection. She started to time her strokes,
slow and sharp.

'Out west,' she murmured, 'about five hours away by cruiser, there's an island. It's
mine. No one goes there, there's a fifty-kilometre exclusion umbrella, satellite
patrolled, but it's beautiful. I've built a complex there, with a clone bank and a
re-sleeving facility.' Her voice got that uneven edge in it again. 'I sometimes
decant the clones. Sleeve copies of myself. To play. Do you understand what I'm
offering you?'
I made a noise. The image she had just planted, of being the focus for a pack of
bodies like this one, all orchestrated by the same mind, tightened the last notches
on my hard-on, and her hand slid up and down its full length as if machined
there.
'What was that?' She leaned over me, brushing her nipples across my chest.
'How long?' I managed, through the coiling and uncoiling of my stomach
muscles, through the flesh and mist tones of the Merge Nine. 'Is this fun park
invitation good for?'
She grinned then, a grin of pure lechery.
'Unlimited rides,' she said.
'But for a limited period only, right?'
She shook her head. 'No, you don't understand me. This place is mine. All of it,
the island, the sea around it, everything on it. Is mine. I can keep you there as
long as you care to stay. Until you tire of it.'
'That might take a long time.'
'No.' There was a hint of sadness in the way she shook her head this time and her
gaze fell a little. 'No it won't.'
The pistoning grip on my penis slackened fractionally. I groaned and grabbed at
her hand, forcing it back into motion. The move seemed to rekindle her, and she
went to work again in earnest, speeding up and slowing down, bending to feed
me her breasts or supplement her strokes with sucking and licking. My time
perception spiralled out of sight to be replaced with an endless gradient of sensation that sloped upward, excruciatingly slowly, towards a peak I could hear
myself begging for in drugged tones somewhere far away.

As the orgasm loomed, I was vaguely aware through the Merge Nine link that
she was sinking fingers into herself, rubbing with an uncontrolled desire
completely at odds with the calculation with which she manipulated me. Finetuned by the empathin, she brought on her own peak a few seconds before mine
and as I started to come, she smeared her own juices hard over my face and
thrashing body.
Whiteout.
And when I came to, much later, with the Merge Nine crash laid across me like a
lead weight, she was gone like a fever dream.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

When you have no friends, and the woman you slept with last night has left you
with a screaming head and without a word, you have a limited number of
options. When I was younger I used to go out looking for squalid brawls in the
streets of Newpest. This got a couple of people stabbed, neither of them me, and
led in turn to my apprenticeship in one of the Harlan's World gangs (Newpest
chapter). Later on, I upgraded this kind of retreat by joining the military;
brawling with a purpose, and with more extensive weaponry, but as it turned out,
just as squalid. I don't suppose I should have been as surprised as I was — the
only thing the marine corps recruiters had really wanted to know was how many
fights I had won.
These days I've evolved a slightly less destructive response to general chemical
malaise. When a forty-minute swim in the Hendrix's underground pool tailed to
dispel either the longing for Miriam Bancroft's torrid company or the Merge
Nine hangover, I did the only thing I felt equipped for. I ordered painkillers from
room service, and went shopping.
Bay City had already settled into the swing of the day by the time I finally hit the
streets, and the commercial centre was choked with pedestrians. I stood on the
edges for a couple of minutes, then dived in and began to look in windows.
A blonde marine sergeant with the unlikely name of Serenity Carlyle taught me
to shop, back on the World. Prior to that I had always employed a technique best
described as precision purchase. You identify your target, you go in, get it and
come out. You can't get what you want, cut your losses and get out equally fast.

Over the period that we spent together, Serenity weaned me off this approach,
and sold me her philosophy of consumer grazing.
'Look,' she told me one day in a Millsport coffee house. 'Shopping — actual,
physical shopping — could have been phased out centuries ago if they'd wanted
it that way.'
'They who?'
'People. Society.' She waved a hand impatiently. 'Whoever. They had the
capacity back then. Mail order, virtual supermarkets, automated debiting
systems. It could have been done and it never happened. What does that tell
you?'
At twenty-two years old, a marine corps grunt via the street gangs of Newpest, it
told me nothing. Carlyle took in my blank look and sighed.
'It tells you that people like shopping. That it satisfies a basic, acquisitive need at
a genetic level. Something we inherited from our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Oh,
you've got automated convenience shopping for basic household items,
mechanical food distribution systems for the marginalised poor. But you've also
got a massive proliferation of commercial hives and speciality markets in food
and crafts which people physically have to go to. Now why would they do that,
if they didn't enjoy it?'
I probably shrugged, maintaining my youthful cool.
'Shopping is physical interaction, exercise of decision-making capacity, sating of
the desire to acquire, and an impulse to more acquisition, a scouting urge. It's so
basically flicking human when you think about it. You've got to learn to love it,
Tak. I mean you can cross the whole archipelago on a hover, you never even
need to get wet. But that doesn't take the basic pleasure out of swimming, does
it? Learn to shop well, Tak. Get flexible. Enjoy the uncertainty.'
Enjoyment wasn't exactly what I was feeling at the moment, but I stuck with it
and I stayed flexible, true to Serenity Carlyle's creed. I started out vaguely
looking for a heavy-duty waterproof jacket, but the thing that finally pulled me
into a shop was a pair of all-terrain walking boots.
The boots were followed by loose black trousers and a crossover insulated top

with enzyme seals that ran all the way from waist to a tight crew neck. I'd seen
variations on the outfit a hundred times on the streets of Bay City so far. Surface
assimilation. It would do. After brief hungover reflection, I added a defiant red
silk bandanna across my forehead, Newpest gang style. It wasn't exactly
assimilative, but it went with the vaguely mutinous irritation that had been rising
in me since yesterday. I dumped Bancroft's summer suit in a skip on the street
outside and left the shoes beside it.
Before I left it, I searched through the jacket pockets and came up with two
cards: the doctor at Bay City Central and Bancroft's armourer.
Larkin and Green proved to be the names not of two gunsmiths, but of two
streets that intersected on a leafy slope called Russian Hill. The autocab had
some visitors blurb about the area, but I skipped it. Larkin & Green, Armourers
since 2203 was a discreet corner facade, extending less than a half dozen metres
along each street, but bordered by blinded units that looked as if they had
probably been annexed. I pushed through well-cared-for wooden doors into the
cool, oil-smelling interior.
Inside, the place reminded me of the chart room at Suntouch House. There was
space, and light flooding in from two storeys of tall windows. The first floor had
been removed and replaced with a wide gallery on four sides overlooking the
ground level. The walls were hung with flat display cases and the space under
the gallery overhang hosted heavy glass-topped trolleys that performed the same
function. There was the faint tang of an ambient modifier in the air, scent of old
trees under the gun oil, and the floor under my newly booted feet was carpeted.
A black steel face appeared over the gallery rail. Green photo-receptors burned
in place of eyes. 'May I be of assistance, sir?'
'I'm Takeshi Kovacs. I'm here from Laurens Bancroft,' I said, tipping my head
back to meet the mandroid's gaze. 'I'm looking for some hardware.'
'Of course, sir.' The voice was smoothly male and devoid of any sales subsonics
I could detect. 'Mr Bancroft told us to expect you. I am with a client, but I shall
be down presently. Please make yourself at home. There are chairs to your left
and a refreshments cabinet. Please help yourself.'
The head disappeared and a murmured conversation I had vaguely registered
when I came in was resumed. I located the refreshments cabinet, found it

stocked with alcohol and cigars and closed it hurriedly. The painkillers had taken
the edge off the Merge Nine hangover, but I was in no fit state for further abuse.
With a light shock, I realised I'd gone through the day so far without a cigarette.
I wandered over to the nearest display case and looked in at a selection of
samurai swords. There were date tickets attached to the scabbards. Some of them
were older than me.
The next case held a rack of brown and grey projectile weapons that seemed to
have been grown rather than machined. The barrels sprouted from organically
curved wrappings that flared gently back to the stock. These too were dated back
into the last century. I was trying to decipher the curled engraving on a barrel
when I heard a metallic tread on the staircase behind me.
'Has sir found anything to his liking?'
I turned to face the approaching mandroid. Its entire body was the same polished
gunmetal, moulded into the muscle configuration of an archetypal human male.
Only the genitals were absent. The face was long and thin, fine-featured enough
to hold attention despite its immobility. The head was carved into furrows to
represent thick backcombed hair. Stamped across the chest was the almost
eroded legend Mars Expo 2076.
'Just looking.' I said and gestured back at the guns. 'Are these made of wood?'
The green photo-receptor gaze regarded me gravely. 'That is correct, sir. The
stocks are a beech hybrid. They are all handmade weapons. Kalashnikov, Purdey
and Beretta. We stock all the European houses here. \Vhich was sir interested
in?'
I looked back. There was a curious poetry to the forms, something slung part
way between functional bluntness and organic grace, something that cried out to
be cradled. To be used.
'They're a bit ornate for me. I had in mind something a little more practical.'
'Certainly, sir. Can we assume sir is not a novice in this field?'
I grinned at the machine. 'We can assume that:.'
'Then perhaps sir would care to tell me what his preferences in the past have

been.'
'Smith & Wesson 11mm Magnum. Ingram 40 flechette gun. Sunjet particle
thrower. But that wasn't in this sleeve.'
The green receptors glowed. No comment. Perhaps it hadn't been programmed
for light conversation with Envoys.
'And what exactly is sir looking for in this sleeve?'
I shrugged. 'Something subtle. Something not. Projectile weapons. And a blade.
The heavy one needs to be something like the Smith.'
The mandroid became quite still. I could almost hear the whirring of data
retrieval. I wondered briefly how a machine like this had come to wind up here.
It had clearly not been designed for the job. On Harlan's World, you don't see
many mandroids. They're expensive to build, compared to a synthetic, or even a
clone, and most jobs that require a human form are better done by those organic
alternatives. The truth is that a robot human is a pointless collision of two
disparate functions. Artificial intelligence, which really works better strung out
on a mainframe, and hard-wearing, hazardproof bodywork which most cyberengineering firms designed to spec for the task in hand. The last robot I'd seen on
the World was a gardening crab.
The photo-receptors brightened slightly and the thing's posture unlocked. 'If sir
would care to come this way, I believe I have the right combination.'
I followed the machine through a door that blended so well with the decor of the
back wall that I hadn't seen it and down a short corridor. Beyond was a long, low
room whose unpainted plaster walls were lined with raw fibre-glass packing
cases. There were a number of people working quietly at points up and down the
room. The air carried the businesslike rattle of hardware in practised hands. The
mandroid led me to a small grey-haired man dressed in grease-streaked coveralls
who was stripping down an electromag bolt-thrower as if it were a roast chicken.
He looked up as we approached.
'Chip?' He nodded at the machine and ignored me.
'Clive, this is Takeshi Kovacs. He's a friend of Mr Bancroft, looking for
equipment. I'd like you to show him the Nemex and a Philips gun, and then pass

him on to Sheila for a blade weapon.'
Clive nodded again and set aside the electromag.
'This way,' he said.
The mandroid touched my arm lightly. 'Should sir require anything further, I
shall be in the showroom.'
It bowed fractionally and left. I followed Clive along the rows of packing cases
to where a variety of handguns were laid out on piles of plastic confetti. He
selected one and turned back to me with it in his hands.
'Second series Nemesis X,' he said, holding out the gun. 'The Nemex.
Manufactured under licence for Mannlicher-Schoenauer. Fires a jacketed slug
with a customised propellant called Druck 31. Very powerful, very accurate. The
magazine takes eighteen shells in a staggered clip. Bit bulky but worth it in a
firefight. Feel the weight.'
I took the weapon and turned it over in my hands. It was a big, heavy-barrelled
pistol, slightly longer than the Smith & Wesson but well balanced. I swapped it
hand to hand for a while, getting the feel of it, squinted down the sight. Clive
waited beside me patiently
'All right.' I handed it back. 'And something subtle?'
'Philips squeeze gun.' Clive reached into an open packing case and dug inside the
confetti until he came up with a slim grey pistol almost half the size of the
Nemex. 'A solid steel load. Uses an electromagnetic accelerator. Completely
silent, accurate up to about twenty metres. No recoil, and you've got a reverse
field option on the generator that means the slugs can be retrieved from the
target afterwards. Takes ten.'
'Batteries?'
'Specs are for between forty and fifty discharges. After that, you're losing muzzle
velocity with every shot. You get two replacement batteries included in the price
and a recharging kit compatible with household power outlets.'
'Do you have a firing range? Somewhere I can try these out?'

'Out the back. But both these babies come with a virtual combat practice disc
and that's perfect parity between virtual and actual performance. Warranty
guarantees it.'
'All right, fine.' Collecting on a guarantee like that might prove a slow process if
some cowboy used the resulting unhandiness to put a bullet through your skull.
No telling when you might get re-sleeved, if at all. But by now the ache in my
head was beginning to get through the painkillers. Maybe target practice wasn't
the thing right at that moment. I didn't bother asking the price either. It wasn't my
money I was spending. 'Ammunition?'
'Comes in boxes of five, both guns, but you get a free clip with the Nemex. Sort
of a promotion for the new line. That going to be enough?'
'Not really. Give me two five-packs for both guns.'
'Ten clips, each?' There was a dubious respect in Clive's voice. Ten clips is a lot
of ammunition for a handgun, but I'd discovered that there were times when
being able to fill the air with bullets was worth a lot more than actually hitting
anything. 'And you wanted a blade, right?'
'That's right.'
'Sheila!' Clive turned away down the long room and called out to a tall woman
with crewcut blonde hair who was sitting cross-legged on a crate with her hands
in her lap and the matt grey of a virtual set masking her face. She looked round
when she heard her name, remembered the mask and tipped it off, blinking.
Clive waved at her and she uncoiled herself from the crate, swaying slightly
from the shift back to reality as she got up.
'Sheila, this guy's looking for steel. You want to help him out?'
'Sure.' The woman reached out a lanky arm. 'Name's Sheila Sorenson. What kind
of steel you looking for?'
I matched her grip. 'Takeshi Kovacs. I need something I can throw in a hurry, but
it's got to be small. Something I can strap to a forearm.'
'All right,' she said amiably. 'Want to come with me? You finished here?'

Clive nodded at me. 'I'll take this stuff out to Chip, and he'll package it up for
you. You want it for delivery or carry out?'
'Carry out.'
'Thought so.'
Sheila's end of the business turned out to be a small rectangular room with a
couple of silhouette cork targets on one wall and an array of weapons ranging
from stilettos to machetes hung on the other three. She selected a flat black knife
with a grey metal blade about fifteen centimetres long and took it down.
'Tebbit knife,' she said inconsequentially. 'Very nasty.'
And with every appearance of casualness she turned and unleashed the weapon
at the left-hand target. It skipped through the air like something alive and buried
itself in the silhouette's head. 'Tantalum steel alloy blade, webbed carbon hilt.
There's a flint set in the pommel for weighting and of course you can bash them
over the head with that if you don't get them with the sharp end.'
I stepped across to the target and freed the knife. The blade was narrow and
honed to a razor's edge on each side. A shallow gutter ran down the centre,
delineated with a thin red line that had tiny, intricate characters etched into it. I
tilted the weapon in an attempt to read the engraving, but it was in a code I didn't
recognise. Light glinted dully off the grey metal.
'What's this?'
'What?' Sheila moved to stand beside me. 'Oh, yeah. Bioweapon coding. The
runnel is coated with C-381. Produces cyanide compounds on contact with
haemoglobin. Well away from the edges, so if you cut yourself there's no
problem, but if you sink it in anything with blood . . . '
'Charming.'
'Told you it was nasty, didn't I.' There was pride in her voice.
'I'll take it.'
Back out on the street, weighed down with my purchases, it occurred to me I'd

need a jacket after all, if only to conceal the newly acquired arsenal. I cast a
glance upward in search of an autocab and decided instead that there was enough
sun in the sky to justify walking. I thought, at last, that my hangover was
beginning to recede.
I was three blocks down the hill before I realised I was being tailed.
It was the Envoy conditioning, stirring sluggishly to life in the wake of the
Merge Nine, that told me. Enhanced proximity sense, the faintest shiver and a
figure in the corner of my eye once too often. This one was good. In a more
crowded part of town I might have missed it, but here the pedestrians were too
thin on the ground to provide much camouflage.
The Tebbit knife was strapped to my left forearm in a soft leather sheath with
neural spring-load, but neither of the guns was accessible without making it
obvious that I'd spotted my shadow. I debated trying to lose the tail, but
abandoned the idea almost as soon as it occurred to me. It wasn't my town, I felt
sludgy with chemicals and anyway I was carrying too much. Let whoever it was
come shopping with me. I picked up my pace a little and worked my way
gradually down into the commercial centre, where I found an expensive thighlength red and blue wool coat with Inuit-inspired totem pole figures chasing each
other in lines across it. It wasn't quite what I'd had in mind, but it was warm and
had numerous capacious pockets. Paying for it at the shop's glass front, I
managed to catch a glimpse of my tail's face. Young, Caucasian, dark hair. I
didn't know him.
The two of us crossed Union Square, pausing to take in another Resolution 653
demonstration that had stalled in a corner and was gradually wearing thin. The
chants wavered, people drifted away and the metallic bark of the p.a. system was
beginning to sound plaintive. There was a good chance I could have slipped
away in the crowd, but by now I couldn't be bothered. If the tail had been going
to do anything other than watch, he'd had his chance back in the leafy seclusion
of the hills. There was too much going on here for a hit. I steered my way
through the remnants of the demonstration, brushing aside the odd leaflet, and
then headed south towards Mission Street and the Hendrix.
On my way down Mission, I stepped inadvertently into the cast radius of a street
seller. Instantly, my head flooded with images. I was moving along an alley full
of women whose clothing was designed to display more dian they would have

shown of themselves naked. Boots that turned legs into slices of consumer flesh
above the knee, thighs with arrow-shaped bands pointing the way, structural
support lifting and pressing breasts out for view; heavy, rounded pendants
nestling glans-like in sweat-beaded cleavages. Tongues flickered out, licked
across lips painted cherry red or tomb black, teeth were bared in challenge.
A tide of cool swept in across me, erasing the sweaty need and turning the
posturing bodies into an abstract expression of womanhood. I found myself
tracking angles and the circumferences of bulges like a machine, mapping the
geometry of flesh and bone as if the women were a species of plant.
Betathanatine. The Reaper.
Final offspring of an extended chemical family engineered for near death
research projects early in the millennium, betathanatine brought the human body
as close to flatline status as was feasible without gross cellular damage. At the
same time, control stimulants in the Reaper molecule induced a clinical
functioning of intellect which had enabled researchers to go through artificially
induced death experiences without the overwhelming sense of emotion and
wonder that might mar their data perception. Used in smaller doses, Reaper
produced a depth of cool indifference to such things as pain, arousal, joy and
grief. All the detachment that men had pretended for centuries before the naked
female form was there for the taking, in capsule. It was almost custom built for
the male adolescent market.
It was also an ideal military drug. Riding the Reaper, a Godwin's Dream
renouncer monk could torch a village full of women and children and feel
nothing but fascination for the way the flames melted flesh from bone.
The last time I'd used betathanatine had been in street battles on Sharya. A full
dose, designed to bring body temperature down to room normal and slow my
heart to a fractional rate. Tricks to beat the antipersonnel detectors on Sharyan
spider tanks. With no register on infrared, you could get up close, scale a leg and
crack the hatches with termite grenades. Concussed by the shockwave, the crew
usually slaughtered as easily as newborn kittens.
'Got Stiff, man,' said a hoarse voice redundantly. I blinked away the broadcast
and found myself looking at a pale Caucasian face beneath a grey cowl. The
broadcast unit sat on his shoulder, tiny red active lights winking at me like bat

eyes. On the World there are very tight laws regulating the use of direct-to-head
dissemination, and even accidental broadcasts can generate the same kind of
violence as spilling someone's drink in a wharf-front bar. I shot out one arm and
shoved the dealer hard in the chest. He staggered against a shop front.
'Hey . . . '
'Don't piss in my head, friend. I don't like it.'
I saw his hand snake down to a unit at his waist and guessed what was coming.
Retargetting, I got the soft of his eyes under my stiffened fingers . . .
And was face to face with a hissing mound of wet membranous flesh nearly two
metres tall. Tentacles writhed at me and my hand was reaching into a phlegmstreaked hollow framed with thick black cilia. My gorge rose and my throat
closed up. Riding out a shudder of revulsion, I pushed into the seething cilia and
felt the slimy flesh give.
'You want to go on seeing, you'll unplug that shit,' I said tightly.
The mound of flesh vanished and I was back with the dealer, fingers still pressed
hard onto the upper curves of his eyeballs.
'All right, man, all right.' He held up his hands, palms out. 'You don't want the
stuff, don't buy it. I'm just trying to make a living here.'
I stepped back and gave him the space to get off the shop front he was pinned to.
'Where I come from, you don't go into people's heads on the street,' I offered by
way of explanation. But he'd already sensed my retreat from the confrontation
and he just made a gesture with his thumb which I assumed was obscene.
'I give a fuck where you're from? Fucking grasshopper? Get out of my face.'
I left him there, wondering idly as I crossed the street if there was any moral
difference between him and the genetic designers who had built Merge Nine into
Miriam Bancroft's sleeve.
I paused on a corner and bent my head to kindle a cigarette.

Mid afternoon. My first of the day.

CHAPTER TWELVE

As I dressed in the mirror that night, I suffered the hard-edged conviction that
someone else was wearing my sleeve and that I had been reduced to the role of a
passenger in the observation car behind the eyes.
Psychoentirety rejection, they call it. Or just fragmenting. It's not unusual to get
some tremors, even when you're an experienced sleeve-changer, but this was the
worst case I'd had for years. For long moments I was literally terrified to have a
detailed thought, in case the man in the mirror noticed my presence. Frozen, I
watched him adjust the Tebbit knife in its neurospring sheath, pick up the Nemex
and the Philips gun one by one and check the load of each weapon. The slug
guns had both come equipped with cheap Fibregrip holsters that enzyme-bonded
to clothing wherever they were pressed. The man in the mirror settled the Nemex
under his left arm where it would be hidden by his jacket and stowed the Philips
gun in the small of his back. He practised snatching the guns from their holsters
a couple of times, throwing them out at his reflection, but there was no need. The
virtual practice discs had lived up to Clive's promises. He was ready to kill
someone with either weapon.
I shifted behind his eyes.
Reluctantly, he stripped off the guns and the knife and laid them once more on
the bed. Then he stood for a while until the unreasonable feeling of nakedness
had passed.
The weakness of weapons, Virginia Vidaura had called it, and from day one in

Envoy training it was considered a cardinal sin to fall into it.
A weapon — any weapon — is a tool, she told us. Cradled in her arms was a
Sunjet particle gun. Designed for a specific purpose, just as any tool is, and only
useful in that purpose. You would think a man a fool to carry a force hammer
with him everywhere simply because he is an engineer. And as it is with
engineers, so it is doubly with Envoys.
In the ranks, Jimmy de Soto coughed his amusement. At the time he was
speaking for most of us. Ninety per cent of Envoy intake came up through the
Protectorate's conventional forces, where weaponry generally held a status
somewhere between that of toy and personal fetish. UN marines went
everywhere armed, even on furlough.
Virginia Vidaura heard the cough and caught Jimmy's eye.
'Mr de Soto. You do not agree.'
Jimmy shifted, a little abashed at how he easily he had been picked out. 'Well,
ma'am. My experience has been that the more punch you carry, the better
account you give of yourself.'
There was a faint of ripple of assent through the ranks. Virginia Vidaura waited
until it subsided.
'Indeed,' she said, and held out the particle thrower in both hands. 'This . . .
device punches somewhat. Please come here and take it.'
Jimmy hesitated a little, but then pushed his way to the front and took the
weapon. Virginia Vidaura fell back so that Jimmy was centre stage before the
assembled trainees and stripped off her Corps jacket. In the sleeveless coveralls
and spacedeck slippers, she looked slim and very vulnerable.
'You will see,' she said loudly, 'that the charge setting is at Test. If you hit me, it
will result in a small first degree burn, nothing more. I am at a distance of
approximately five metres. I am unarmed. Mr de Soto, would you care to attempt
to mark me? On your call.'
Jimmy looked startled, but he duly brought the Sunjet up to check the setting,
then lowered it and looked at the woman opposite him.

'On your call,' she repeated.
'Now,' he snapped.
It was almost impossible to follow. Jimmy was swinging the Sunjet as the word
left his mouth, and in approved firefight fashion, he cut the charge loose before
the barrel even reached the horizontal. The air filled with the particle thrower's
characteristic angry crackle. The beam licked out. Virginia Vidaura was not
there. Somehow she had judged the angle of the beam to perfection, and ducked
away from it. Somehow else, she had closed the five-metre gap by half and the
jacket in her right hand was in motion. It wrapped around the barrel of the Sunjet
and jerked the weapon aside. She was on Jimmy before he realised what had
happened, batting the particle thrower away across the training room floor,
tripping and tumbling him and bringing the heel of one palm gently to rest under
his nose.
The moment stretched and then broke as the man next to me pursed his lips and
blew out a long, low whistle. Virginia Vidaura bowed her head slightly in the
direction of the sound, then bounced to her feet and helped Jimmy up.
'A weapon is a tool,' she repeated, a little breathlessly. 'A tool for killing and
destroying. And there will be times when, as an Envoy, you must kill and
destroy. Then you will choose and equip yourself with the tools that you need.
But remember the weakness of weapons. They are an extension — you are the
killer and destroyer. You are whole, with or without them.'
Shrugging his way into the Inuit jacket, he met his own eyes in the mirror once
more. The face he saw looking back was no more expressive than the mandroid
at Larkin & Green. He stared impassively at it for a moment, then lifted one
hand to rub at the scar under the left eye. A final glance up and down and I left
the room with the sudden cold resurgence of control flooding through my nerves.
Riding down in the elevator, away from the mirror, I forced a grin.
Got the frags, Virginia.
Breathe, she said. Move. Control.
And we went out into the street. The Hendrix offered me a courteous good
evening as I stepped through the main doors, and across the street my tail
emerged from a tea-house and drifted along parallel to me. I walked for a couple

of blocks, getting the feel of the evening and wondering whether to lose him.
The half-hearted sunlight had persisted for most of the day and the sky was more
or less unclouded, but it still wasn't warm. According to a map I'd called up from
the Hendrix, Licktown was a good dozen and a half blocks south. I paused on a
corner, signalled an autocab down from the prowl lane above and saw my tail
doing the same as I climbed aboard.
He was beginning to annoy me.
The cab curved away southwards. I leaned forward and passed a hand over the
visitors' blurb panel.
'Welcome to Urbline services,' said a smooth female voice. 'You are linked to the
Urbline central datastack. Please state the information you require.'
'Are there any unsafe areas in Licktown?'
'The zone designated Licktown is generally considered to be unsafe in its
entirety,' said the datastack blandly. 'However, Urbline services guarantee
carriage to any destination within the Bay City limits and — '
'Yeah. Can you give me a street reference for the highest incidence of violent
criminality in the Licktown area?'
There was a brief pause while the datahead went down rarely used channels.
'Nineteenth Street, the blocks between Missouri and Wisconsin show fifty-three
incidences of organic damage over the last year. One hundred seventy-seven
prohibited substance arrests, one hundred twenty-two with incidence of minor
organic damage, two hun — '
'That's fine. How far is it from Jerry's Closed Quarters, Mariposa and San
Bruno?'
'Straight line distance is approximately one kilometre.'
'Got a map?'
The console lit up with a street grid, complete with location cross hairs for
Jerry's and the names of the streets fired in green. I studied it for a couple of

moments.
'All right. Drop me there. Nineteenth and Missouri.'
'As part of our customer charter, it is my duty to warn you that this is not an
advisable destination.'
I sat back and felt the grin creeping back onto my face, unforced this time.
'Thanks.'
The cab set me down, without further protest, at the cross of Nineteenth and
Missouri. I glanced around as I climbed out and grinned again. Inadvisable
destination had been a typical machine understatement.
Where the streets I'd chased the Mongolian through the night before were
deserted, this part of Licktown was alive, and its inhabitants made Jerry's
clientele look almost salubrious. As I paid off the autocab, a dozen heads
swivelled to focus on me, none of them wholly human. I could almost feel
mechanical photomultiplier eyes ratcheting in from a distance on the currency I'd
chosen to pay with, seeing the notes in ghostly luminescent green; canineaugmented nostrils twitching with the scent of my hotel bath gel, the whole
crowd picking up the blip of wealth on their street sonar like the trace of a
bottleback shoal on a Millsport skipper's screen.
The second cab was spiralling down behind me. An unlit alley beckoned, less
than a dozen metres away. I'd barely stepped into it when the first of the locals
made their play.
'You looking for something, tourist?'
There were three of them, the lead vocalist a two-and-a-half-rnetre giant naked
to the waist with what looked like Nakamura's entire muscle graft sales for the
year wrapped around his arms and trunk. There were red illuminum tattoos
under the skin of his pectorals so his chest looked like a dying coal fire and a
glans-headed cobra reared up the ridged muscle of his stomach from his
waistline. The hands that hung open at his sides were tipped with filed talons.
His face was seamed with scar tissue from the freak fights he had lost and there
was a cheap prosthetic magnilens screwed into one eye. His voice was
surprisingly soft and sad sounding.

'Come slumming, maybe,' the figure on the giant's right said viciously. He was
young and slim and pale with long, fine hair falling across his face and there was
a twitchiness about his stance that said cheap neurachem. He would be the
fastest.
The third member of the welcoming committee said nothing, but lips peeled
back from a canine snout to show transplanted predator teeth and an
unpleasantly long tongue. Below the surgically augmented head, the body was
male human beneath tightly strapped leather.
Time was shortening. My tail would be paying off his cab, getting his bearings.
If he'd decided to take the risk. I cleared my throat.
'I'm just passing through. You're wise, you'll let me. There's a citizen landing
back there you'll find easier to take.'
There was a brief, disbelieving pause. Then the giant reached for me. I brushed
away his hand, fell back a step and wove a rapid pattern of obvious killing
strikes into the air between us. The trio froze, the canine augment snarling. I
drew breath.
'Like I said, you're wise you'll let me pass.'
The giant was ready to let it go. I could see it in his broken face. He'd been a
fighter long enough to spot combat training and the instincts of a lifetime in the
ring told him when the balance was tipped. His two companions were younger
and knew less about losing. Before he could say anything, the pale kid with the
neurachem lashed out with something sharp and the augment went for my right
arm. My own neurachem, already ticking over and probably more pricey, was
faster. I took the kid's arm and broke it at the elbow, twisting him round on his
own pain and into his two companions. The augment ducked around him and I
kicked out, connecting hard with nose and mouth. A yelp and he went down. The
kid dropped to his knees, keening and nursing his shattered elbow. The giant
surged forward and fetched up with the stiffened fingers of my right hand a
centimetre from his eyes.
'Don't,' I said quietly
The kid moaned on the ground at our feet. Behind him, the canine augment lay
where the kick had thrown him, twitching feebly. The giant crouched between

them, big hands reaching as if to comfort. He looked up at me, mute accusation
for something in his face.
I backed away down the alley about a dozen metres, then turned and sprinted.
Let my tail work his way through that and catch me up.
The alley made a right-angle turn before spilling out onto another crowded
street. I turned the corner and let my speed run down so that I emerged into the
street at a fast walk. Turning left, I shouldered my way into the midst of the
crowd and started looking for street signs.

Outside Jerry's, the woman was still dancing, imprisoned in the cocktail glass.
The club sign was alight and business seemed, if anything, to be brisker than the
previous night. Small knots of people came and went beneath the flexing arms of
the door robot, and the dealers I'd injured during the fight with the Mongolian
had been replaced several times over.
I crossed the street and stood before the robot while it padded me down, and the
synth voice said, 'Clear. Do you want cabins or bar?'
'What's the deal in the bar?'
'Ha ha ha,' went the laugh protocol. 'The bar is look, but don't touch. No money
down, no hands on. House rule. That applies to other customers too.'
'Cabins.'
'Down the stairs, to the left. Take a towel from the pile.'
Down the stairs, along the corridor lit in rotating red, past the towel alcove and
the first four closed cabin doors. Blood-deep thunder of the junk rhythm in the
air. I closed the fifth door behind me, fed a tew notes to the credit console for
appearances' sake, and stepped up to the frosted glass screen.
'Louise?'
The curves of her body thudded against the glass, breasts flattened. The cherry
light in the cabin flung stripes of light across her.

'Louise, it's me. Irene. Lizzie's mother.'
A smear of something dark between the breasts, across the glass. The neurachem
leapt alive inside me. Then the glass door slid aside and the girl's body sagged
off its inner surface into my arms. A wide-muzzled gun appeared over her
shoulder, pointed at my head.
'Right there, fucker,' said a tight voice. 'This is a toaster. You do one wrong thing,
it'll take your head off your chest and turn your stack to solder.'
I froze. There was an urgency in the voice that wasn't far off panic. Very
dangerous.
'That's it.' The door behind me opened, gusting the pulse of the music in the
corridor, and a second gun muzzle jammed into my back. 'Now you put her
down, real slow, and stand back.'
I lowered the body in my arms gently onto the satin padded floor and stood up
again. Bright white light sprang up in the cabin, and the revolving cherry blinked
pinkly twice and went out. The door behind me thudded shut on the music while
before me, a tall blond man in close-fitting black advanced into the room,
knuckles whitened on the trigger of his particle blaster. His moudi was
compressed and the whites of his eyes were flaring around stimulant-blasted
pupils. The gun in my back bore me forward and the blond kept coming until the
muzzle of the blaster was smearing my lower lip against my teeth.
'Now who the fuck are you?' he hissed at me.
I turned my head aside far enough to open my mouth. 'Irene Elliott. My daughter
used to work here.'
The blond stepped forward, gun muzzle tracing a line down my cheek and under
my chin.
'You're lying to me,' he said softly. 'I've got a friend out at the Bay City justice
facility, and he tells me Irene Elliott's still on stack. See, we checked out the bag
of shit you sold this cunt.'
He kicked at the inert body on the floor and I peered down out of the corner of
my nearest eye. In the harsh white light the marks of torture were livid on the

girl's flesh.
'Now I want you to think real carefully about your next answer, whoever you
are. Why are you asking after Lizzie Elliott?'
I slid my eyes back over the barrel of the blaster to the clenched face beyond. It
wasn't the expression of someone who'd been dealt in. Too scared.
'Lizzie Elliott's my daughter, you piece of shit, and if your friend up at the city
store had any real access, you'd know why the record still says I'm on stack.'
The gun in my back shoved forward more sharply, but unexpectedly the blond
seemed to relax. His mouth flexed in a rictus of resignation. He lowered the
blaster.
'All right,' he said. 'Deck, go and get Oktai.'
Someone at my back slipped out of the cabin. The blond waved his gun at me.
'You. Sit down in the corner.' His tone was distracted, almost casual.
I felt the gun taken out of my back and moved to obey. As I settled onto the satin
floor, I weighed the odds. With Deck gone, there were still three of them. The
blond, a woman in what looked to me like a synthetic Asian-skinned sleeve,
toting the second particle blaster whose imprint I could still feel in my spine, and
a large black man whose only weapon appeared to be an iron pipe. Not a chance.
These were not the street sharks I'd faced down on Nineteenth Street. There was
a cold embodied purpose about them, a kind of cheap version of what Kadmin
had had back at the Hendrix.
For a moment I looked at the synthetic woman and wondered, but it couldn't be.
Even if he'd somehow managed to slip the charges Kristin Ortega had talked
about and got himself re-sleeved. Kadmin was on the inside. He knew who had
hired him, and who I was. The faces peering at me from around the biocabin, on
their own admission, knew nothing.
Let's keep it that way.
My gaze crept across to Louise's battered sleeve. It looked as if they had cut slits
in the skin of her thighs and then forced the wounds apart until they tore. Simple,
crude and very effective. They would have made her watch while they did it,

compounding the pain with terror. It's a gut-swooping experience seeing that
happen to your body. On Sharya, the religious police used it a lot. She'd probably
need psychosurgery to get over the trauma.
The blond saw where my eyes had gone and offered me a grim nod, as if I'd been
an accomplice to the act.
'Want to know why her head's still on, huh?'
I looked bleakly across the room at him. 'No. You look like a busy man but I
guess you'll get round to it.'
'No need,' he said casually, enjoying his moment. 'Old Anenome's Catholic.
Third or fourth generation, the girls tell me. Sworn affidavit on disc, full Vow of
Abstention filed with the Vatican. We take on a lot like that. Real convenient
sometimes.'
'You talk too much, Jerry,' said the woman.
The blond's eyes flared whitely at her, but whatever retort he was mustering
behind the curl of his lip quietened as two men, presumably Deek and Oktai,
pushed into the tiny room on another wave of junk rhythm from the corridor. My
eyes measured Deck and placed him in the same category — muscle — as the
pipe-wielder, then switched to his companion, who was staring steadily at me.
My heart twitched. Oktai was the Mongol.
Jerry jerked his head in my direction.
'This him?' he asked.
Oktai nodded slowly, a savage grin of triumph etched across his broad face. His
massive hands were clenching and unclenching at his sides. He was working
through an extreme of hate so deep it was choking him. I could see the bump
where someone had inexpertly repaired his broken nose with tissue weld, but
that didn't seem like enough to warrant the fury I was watching.
'All right, Ryker.' The blond leaned forward a little. 'You want to change your
story? You want to tell me why you're breaking my balls down here?'
He was talking to me.

Deck spat into a corner of the room.
'I don't know,' I said clearly, 'what the fuck you are talking about. You turned my
daughter into a prostitute, and then you killed her. And for that, I'm going to kill
you.'
'I doubt you'll get the chance for that,' said Jerry, crouching opposite me and
looking at the floor. 'Your daughter was a stupid, starstruck little cunt who
thought she could put a lock on me and — '
He stopped and shook his head disbelievingly.
'The fuck am I talking to? I see you standing there, and still I'm buying this shit.
You're good, Ryker, I'll give you that.' He sniffed. 'Now, I'm going to ask you
one more time, nicely. Maybe see if we can cut a deal. After that I'm going to
send you to see some very sophisticated friends of mine. You understand what
I'm saying?'
I nodded once, slowly.
'Good. So here it comes, Ryker. What are you doing in Licktown?'
I looked into his face. Small-time punk with delusions of connection. I wasn't
going to learn anything here.
'Who's Ryker?'
The blond lowered his head again and looked at the floor between my feet. He
seemed unhappy about: what was going to happen next. Finally he licked his
lips, nodded slightly to himself and made a brushing gesture across his knees as
he stood up.
'All right, tough guy. But I want you to remember you had the choice.' He turned
to the synthetic woman. 'Get him out of here. I want no traces. And tell them,
he's n-wired to the eyes, they'll get nothing out of him in this sleeve.'
The woman nodded and gestured me to my feet with her blaster. She prodded
Louise's corpse with the toe of one boot. 'And this?'
'Get rid of it. Milo, Deek, go with her.'

The pipe-wielder shoved his weapon into his waistband and stooped to shoulder
the corpse as if it were a bundle of kindling. Deek, close behind, slapped it
affectionately on one bruised buttock.
The Mongol made a noise in his throat. Jerry glanced across at him with faint
distaste. 'No, not you. They're going places I don't want you to see. Don't worry,
there'll be a disc.'
'Sure, man,' said Deek over his shoulder. 'We'll bring it right back across.'
'All right, that's enough,' said the woman roughly, moving to face me. 'Let's have
an understanding here, Ryker. You got neurachern, so do I. And this is a highimpact chassis. Lockheed-Mitoma test pilot specs. You can't damage me worth a
jack. And I'll be happy to burn your guts out if you even look at me wrong. They
don't care what state you're in where we're going. That clear, Ryker?'
'My name's not Ryker,' I said irritably.
'Right.'
We went through the frosted glass door, into a tiny space that held a make-up
table and shower stall, and out onto a corridor parallel to the one at the front of
the booths. Here the lighting was unambiguous, there was no music, and the
corridor gave onto larger, partially curtained dressing rooms where young men
and women slumped smoking or just staring into space like untenanted
synthetics. If any of them saw the little procession go past, they gave no
indication. Milo went ahead with the corpse. Deck took up position at my back
and the synthetic woman brought up the rear, blaster held casually at her side.
My last glimpse of Jerry was a proprietorial figure standing with hands on hips
in the corridor behind us. Then Deek cuffed me across the side of the head and I
turned to face the front again. Louise's dangling, mutilated legs preceded me out
into a gloomy covered parking area, where a pure black lozenge of aircar
awaited us.
The synthetic cracked the vehicle's boot open and waved the blaster at me.
'Plenty of room. Make yourself comfortable.'
I climbed into the boot space and discovered she was right. Then Milo tipped
Louise's corpse in with me and slammed the lid down, leaving the two of us in

darkness together. I heard the dull clunk of other doors opening and closing
elsewhere, and then the whispering of the car's engines and the faint bump as we
lifted from the ground.
The journey was quick, and smoother than a corresponding surface trip would
have been. Jerry's friends were driving carefully — you don't want to be pulled
down by a bored patrolman for unsignalled lane change when you've got
passengers in the boot. It might almost have been pleasantly womb-like there in
the dark, but for the faint stench of faeces from the corpse. Louise had voided
her bowels during the torture.
I spent most of the journey feeling sorry for the girl, and worrying at the
Catholic madness like a dog with a bone. This woman's stack was utterly
undamaged. Financial considerations aside, she could be brought back to life on
the spin of a disc. On Harlan's World she'd be temporarily re-sleeved for the
court hearing, albeit probably in a synthetic, and once the verdict came down
there'd be a Victim Support supplement from the state added to whatever policy
her family already held. Nine cases out of ten that was enough money to ensure
re-sleeving of some sort. Death, where is thy sting?
I didn't know if they had VS supplements on earth. Kristin Ortega's angry
monologue two nights ago seemed to suggest not, but at least there was the
potential to bring this girl back to life. Somewhere on this fucked-up planet,
some guru had ordained otherwise, and Louise, alias Anenome, had queued up
with how many others to ratify the insanity.
Human beings. Never figure them out.
The car tilted and the corpse rolled unpleasantly against me as we spiralled
down. Something wet seeped through the leg of my trousers. I could feel myself
starting to sweat with the fear. They were going to decant me into some flesh
with none of the resistance to pain that my current sleeve had. And while I was
imprisoned there, they could do whatever they liked to that sleeve, up to and
including physically killing it.
And then they would start again, in a fresh body.
Or, if they were really sophisticated, they could jack my consciousness into a
virtual matrix similar to the ones used in psychosurgery, and do the whole thing
electronically. Subjectively, there'd be no difference, but there what might take

days in the real world could be done in as many minutes.
I swallowed hard, using the neurachem while I still had it to stifle the fear. As
gently as I could, I pushed Louise's cold embrace away from my face and tried
not to think about the reason she had died.
The car touched down and rolled along the ground for a few moments before it
stopped. When the boot cracked open again, all I could see was the roof of
another covered car park strung with illuminum bars.
They took me out with professional caution, the woman standing well back,
Deck and Milo to the sides giving her a clear field of fire. I clambered
awkwardly over Louise and out onto a floor of black concrete. Scanning the
gloom covertly, I saw about a dozen other vehicles, nondescript, registration bar
codes illegible at this distance. A short ramp at the far end led up to what must
be the landing pad. Indistinguishable from a million other similar installations. I
sighed and as I straightened up I felt the damp on my leg again. I glanced down
at my clothes. There was a dark stain of something on my thigh.
'So where are we?' I asked.
'End of the line's where you are,' grunted Milo, lifting Louise out. He looked at
the woman. 'This going to the usual place?'
She nodded, and he set off across the car park towards a set of double doors. I
was moving to follow when a jerk of the woman's blaster brought me up short.
'Not you. That's the chute — the easy way out. We got people want to talk to you
before you get to go down the chute. You go this way.'
Deck grinned and produced a small weapon from his back pocket. 'That's right,
Mr Badass Cop. You go this way.'
They marched me through another set of doors into a commercial capacity
elevator which, according to the flashing LED display on the wall, sank two
dozen levels before we stopped. Throughout the ride, Deck and the woman stood
in opposite corners of the car, guns levelled. I ignored them and watched the
digit counter.
When the doors opened there was a medical team waiting for us with a strap-

equipped gurney. My instincts screamed at me to try and jump them, but I held
myself immobile while the two pale-blue-clad men came forward to hold my
arms and the female medic shot me in the neck with a hypodermic spray. There
was an icy sting, a brief rush of cold and then the corners of my vision
disappeared in webbings of grey. The last thing I saw clearly was the incurious
face of the medic as she watched me lose consciousness.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

I awoke to the sound of the ezan being called somewhere nearby, poetry turned
querulous and metallic in the multiple throats of a mosque's loudspeakers. It was
a sound I'd last heard in the skies over Zihicce on Sharya, and it had been shortly
followed by the shrill aerial scream of marauder bombs. Above my head, light
streamed down through the latticed bars of an ornate window. There was a dull,
bloated feeling in my guts that told me my period was due.
I sat up on the wooden floor and looked down at myself. They'd sleeved me in a
woman's body, young, no more than twenty years old with copper-sheened skin
and a heavy bell of black hair that, when I put my hands to it, felt lank and dirty
with the onset of the period. My skin was faintly greasy and from somewhere I
got the idea that I had not bathed in a while. I was clothed in a rough khaki shirt
several sizes too big for my sleeve and nothing else. Beneath it, my breasts felt
swollen and tender. I was barefoot.
I got up and went to the window. There was no glass but it was well above my
new head height, so I hauled myself up on the bars and peered out. A sundrenched landscape of poorly tiled roofs stretched away as far as I could see,
forested with listing receptor aerials and ancient satellite dishes. A cluster of
minarets speared the horizon off to the left and an ascending aircraft trailed a
line of white vapour somewhere beyond. The air that blew through was hot and
humid.

My arms were beginning to ache, so I lowered myself back down to the floor
and padded across the room to the door. Predictably, it was locked.
The ezan stopped.
Virtuality. They'd tapped into my memories and come up with this. I'd seen some
of the most unpleasant things in a long career of human pain on Sharya. And the
Sharyan religious police were as popular in interrogation software as Angin
Chandra had been in pilot porn. And now, on this harsh virtual Sharya, they'd
sleeved me in a woman.
Drunk one night, Sarah had told me Women are the race, Tak. No two ways
about it. Male is just a mutation with more muscle and half the nerves. Fighting,
fucking machines. My own cross-sleevings had borne that theory out. To be a
woman was a sensory experience beyond the male. Touch and texture ran
deeper, an interface with environment that male flesh seemed to seal out
instinctively. To a man, skin was a barrier, a protection. To a woman it was an
organ of contact.
That had its disadvantages.
In general, and maybe because of this, female pain thresholds ran higher than
male, but the menstrual cycle dragged them down to an all-time low once a
month.
No neurachem. I checked.
No combat conditioning, no reflex of aggression.
Nothing.
Not even calluses on the young flesh.
The door banged open, and I jumped. Fresh sweat sprang out on my skin. Two
bearded men with eyes of hot jet came into the room. They were both dressed in
loose linen for the heat. One held a role of adhesive tape in his hands, the other a
small blowtorch. I flung myself at them, just to unlock the freezing panic reflex
and gain some measure of control over the built-in helplessness.
The one with the tape fended off my slim arms and backhanded me across the

face. It floored me. I lay there, face numb, tasting blood. One of them yanked me
back to my feet by an arm. Distantly, I saw the face of the other, the one who had
hit me, and tried to focus on him.
'So,' he said. 'We begin.'
I lunged for his eyes with the nails of my free arm. The Envoy training gave me
the speed to get there but I had no control and I missed. Two of my nails drew
blood on his cheek. He flinched and jumped back.
'Bitch cunt,' he said, lifting a hand to the claw mark and examining the blood on
his fingers.
'Oh, please,' I managed, out of the unnumbed side of my mouth. 'Do we have to
have the script too? Just because I'm wearing this — '
I jammed to a halt. He looked pleased. 'Not Irene Elliott, then,' he said. 'We
progress.'
This time he hit me just under the ribcage, driving all the breath out of my body
and paralysing my lungs. I folded over his arm like a coat and slid off onto the
floor, trying to draw breath. All that came out was a faint creaking sound. I
twisted on the floorboards while, somewhere high above me, he retrieved the
adhesive tape from the other man and unsnapped a quarter-metre length. It made
an obscene tearing sound, like skin coming off. Shredding it free with his teeth,
he squatted beside me and taped my right wrist to the floor above my head. I
thrashed as if galvanised and it took him a moment to immobilise my other arm
long enough to repeat the process. An urge to scream that wasn't mine surfaced
and I fought it down. Pointless. Conserve your strength.
The floor was hard and uncomfortable against the soft skin of my elbows. I
heard a grating sound and turned my head. The second man was drawing up a
pair of stools from the side of the room. While the one who had beaten me taped
my legs apart, the spectator sat down on one of the stools, produced a packet of
cigarettes and shook one out. Grinning broadly at me, he put it in his mouth and
reached down for the blowtorch. When his companion stepped back to admire
his handiwork, he offered him the packet. It was declined. The smoker shrugged,
ignited the blowtorch and tilted his head to light up from it.
'You will tell us,' he said, gesturing with the cigarette and pluming smoke into

the air above me, 'everything you know about Jerry's Closed Quarters and
Elizabeth Elliott.'
The blowtorch hissed and chuckled softly to itself in the quiet room. Sunlight
poured in through the high window and brought with it, infinitely faintly, the
sounds of a city full of people.
They started with my feet.

The screaming runs on and on, higher and louder than I ever believed a human
throat could render, shredding my hearing. Traceries of red streak across my
vision.
Innenininennininennin . . .
Jimmy de Soto staggers into view, Sunjet gone, gory hands plastered to his face.
The shrieks peel out from his stumbling figure, and for a moment I can almost
believe it's his contamination alarm that's making the noise. I check my own
shoulder meter reflexively, then the half-submerged edge of an intelligible word
rises through the agony and I know it's him.
He is standing almost upright, a clearcut sniper target even in the chaos of the
bombardment. I throw myself across the open ground and knock him into the
cover of a ruined wall. When I roll him onto his back to see what's happened to
his face, he's still screaming. I pull his hands away from his face by main force
and the raw socket of his left eye gapes up at me in the murk. I can still see
fragments of the eye's mucous casing on his fingers.
Jimmy, JIMMY, what the fuck . . . '
The screaming sandpapers on and on. It's taking all my strength to prevent him
going back for the other undamaged eye as it wallows in its socket. My spine
goes cold as I realise what's happening.
Viral strike.
I stop yelling at Jimmy and bawl down the line.

'Medic! Medic! Stack down! Viral strike!'
And the world caves in as I hear my own cries echoed up and dawn the Innenin
beachhead.

After a while, they leave you alone, curled around your wounds. They always
do. It gives you time to think about what they have done to you, more
importantly about what else they have not yet done. The fevered imagining of
what is still to come is almost as potent a tool in their hands as the heated irons
and blades themselves.
When you hear them returning, the echo of footsteps induces such fear that you
vomit up what little bile you have left in your stomach.

Imagine a satellite blow-up of a city on mosaic, 1:10,000 scale. It'll take up most
of a decent interior wall, so stand well back. There are certain obvious things
you can tell at a glance. Is it a planned development or did it grow organically,
responding to centuries of differing demand? Is it or was it ever fortified? Does
it have a seaboard? Look closer, and you can learn more. Where the major thoroughfares are likely to be, if there is an IP shuttle port, if the city has parks. You
can maybe, if you're a trained cartographer, even tell a little about the
movements of the inhabitants. Where the desirable areas of town are, what the
traffic problems are likely to be and if the city has suffered any serious bomb
damage or riots recently.
But there are some things you will never know from that picture. However much
you magnify and reel in detail, it can't tell you if crime is generally on the
increase, or what lime the citizens go to bed. It can't tell you if the mayor is
planning to tear down the old quarter, if the police are corrupt, or what strange
things have been happening at Number Fifty-One, Angel Wharf. And the fact
that you can break down the mosaic into boxes, move it around and reassemble
it elsewhere makes no difference. Some things you will only ever learn by going
into that city and talking to the inhabitants.
Digital Human Storage hasn't made interrogation obsolescent, it's just brought
back the basics. A digitised mind is only a snapshot. You don't capture individual

thoughts any more than a satellite image captures an individual life. A
psychosurgeon can pick out major traumas on an Ellis model, and make a few
basic guesses about what needs to be done, but in the end she's still going to
have to generate a virtual environment in which to counsel her patient, and go in
there and do it. Interrogators, whose requirements are so much more specific,
have an even worse time.
What d.h. storage has done is make it possible to torture a human being to death,
and then start again. With that option available, hypnotic and drug-based
questioning went out the window long ago. It was too easy to provide the
necessary chemical or mental counterconditioning in those for whom this sort of
thing was a hazard of their trade.
There's no kind of conditioning in the known universe that can prepare you for
having your feet burnt off. Or your nails torn out.
Cigarettes stubbed out on your breasts.
A heated iron inserted into your vagina.
The pain. The humiliation.
The damage.

Psychodynamics/Integrity training.
Introduction.
The mind does interesting things under extreme stress. Hallucination,
displacement, retreat. Here in the Corps, you will learn to use them all, not as
blind reactions to adversity, but as moves in a game.

The red hot metal sinks into flesh, parting the skin like polythene. The pain
consumes, but worse is seeing it happen. Your scream, once disbelief, is by now
graesomely familiar in your ears. You know it won't stop them, but you still
scream, begging —

'Some fucking game, eh pal?'
Jimmy grinning up at me from his death. Innenin is still around us, but that can't
be. He was still screaming when they took him away. In reality —
His face changes abruptly, turns sombre.
'You keep reality out of this, there's nothing for you there. Stay removed. Have
they done her any structural harm?''
I wince. 'Her feet. She can't walk.'
'Motherfuckers,' he says matter of factly. 'Why don't we just tell them what they
want to know?'
'We don't know what they want to know. They're after this guy Ryker.'
'Ryker, who the fuck's he?'
'I don't know.'
He shrugs. 'So spill about Bancroft. Or you still feeling honour-bound or
something?'
'I think I already spilled. They don't buy it. It's not what they want to hear. These
are fucking amateurs, man. Meatpackers.'
'You keep screaming it, they got to believe it sooner or later.'
'That isn't the fucking point, Jimmy. When this is over, it doesn't matter who I am,
they're going to put a bolt through my stack and sell the body off for spare parts.'
'Yeah.' Jimmy puts one finger into his empty eye socket and scratches absently at
the clotted gore within. 'See your point. Well, in a construct situation, what you
got to do is get to the next screen somehow. Right?'

During the period on Harlan's World known, with typical grim humour, as the

Unsettlement, guerrillas in the Quellist Black Brigades were surgically
implanted with a quarter-kilo of enzyme-triggered explosive that would, on
demand, turn the surrounding fifty square metres and anything in it to ash. It was
a tactic that met with questionable success. The enzyme in question was furyrelated and the conditioning required for arming the device was patchy. There
were a number of involuntary detonations. Still, no one ever volunteered to
interrogate a member of the Black Brigades. Not after the first one, anyway. Her
name —

You thought they could do nothing worse, but now the iron is inside you and
they are letting it heat up slowly, giving you time to think about it. Your pleading
is babbled —

As I was saying . . .
Her name was Iphigenia Deme, Iffy to those of her friends that had not yet been
slaughtered by Protectorate forces. Her last words, strapped to the interrogation
table downstairs at Number Eighteen, Shimatsu Boulevard, are reputed to have
been: That's fucking enough!
The explosion brought the entire building down.

That's fucking enough!

I jackknifed awake, the last of my screams still shrilling inside me, hands
scrabbling to cover remembered wounds. Instead, I found young, undamaged
flesh beneath crisp linen, a faint rocking motion and the sound of small waves
lapping nearby. Above iny head was a sloping wooden ceiling and a porthole
through which low angled sunlight flooded. I sat up in the narrow bunk and the
sheet fell away from my breasts. The coppery upper slopes were smooth and
unscarred, the nipples intact.

Back to start.
Beside the bed was a simple wooden chair with a white T-shirt and canvas
trousers folded neatly over it. There were rope sandals on the floor. The tiny
cabin held nothing else of interest apart from another bunk, the twin of mine,
whose covers were thrown carelessly back, and a door. A bit crude, but the
message was clear. I slipped into the clothes and walked out onto the sunlit deck
of a small fishing boat.
'Aha, the dreamer.' The woman seated in the stern of the skiff clapped her hands
together as I emerged. She was about ten years older than the sleeve I was
wearing, and darkly handsome in a suit cut from the same linen as my trousers.
There were espadrilles on her bare feet and wide-lensed sunglasses over her
eyes. In her lap was a sketch pad shaded with what looked like a cityscape. As I
stood there, she set it aside and stood up to greet me. Her movements were
elegant, self assured. I felt gawky by comparison.
I looked over the side at the blue water.
'What is it this time?' I said with forced lightness. 'Feed me to the sharks?'
She laughed, showing perfect teeth. 'No, that won't be necessary at this stage. All
I want to do is talk.'
I stood loose limbed, staring at her. 'So talk.'
'Very well.' The woman folded herself gracefully back onto the seat at the stern.
'You have involved yourself in matters that are clearly not your affair, and you
have suffered as a result. My interest is, I think, identical to yours. That is, to
avoid further unpleasantness.'
'My interest is in seeing you die.'
A small smile. 'Yes, I'm sure it is. Even a virtual death would probably be very
satisfying. So, at this point, let me point out that the specifics for this construct
include fifth dan shotokan proficiency.'
She extended a hand to show me the calluses on her knuckles. I shrugged.
'Moreover, we can always return to the way things were earlier.' She pointed out

over the water and, following her arm, I saw the city she had been sketching on
the horizon. Squinting into the reflected sunlight, I could make out the minarets.
I almost managed to smile at the cheap psychology of it. A boat. The sea.
Escape. These boys had bought their programming off the rack.
'I don't want to go back there,' I said truthfully.
'Good. Then tell us who you are.'
I tried not to let the surprise show on my face. The deep-cover training awoke,
spinning lies. 'I thought I had.'
'What you have said is somewhat confused, and you curtailed the interrogation
by stopping your own heart. You are not Irene Elliott, that much is certain. You
do not appear to be Elias Ryker, unless he has undergone substantial retraining.
You claim a connection with Laurens Bancroft, and also to be an offworlder, a
member of the Envoy Corps. This is not what we expected.'
'I bet it isn't,' I muttered.
'We do not wish to be involved in matters which do not concern us.'
'You already are involved. You've abducted and tortured an Envoy. You got any
idea what the Corps will do to you for that. They'll hunt you down and feed your
stacks to the EMP. All of you. Then your families, then your business associates,
then their families and then anyone else who gets in the way. By the time they've
finished you won't even be a memory. You don't fuck with the Corps and live to
write songs about it. They'll eradicate you.'
It was a colossal bluff. The Corps and I had not been on speaking terms for at
least a decade of my subjective lifeline, and the best part of a century of
objective time. But throughout the Protectorate the Envoys were a threat that
could be dealt across the table to anyone up to and including a planetary
President with the same assurance that small children in Newpest are threatened
with the Patchwork Man.
'It was my understanding,' said the woman quietly, 'that the Envoy Corps were
banned from operations on Earth unless UN mandated. Perhaps you have as
much to lose by revelation as anyone else?'

Mr Bancroft has an undeclared influence in the UN Court, which is more or less
common knowledge. Oumoti Prescott's words came back to me, and I leapt to
parry.
'Perhaps you would like to take that up with Laurens Bancroft and the UN
Court,' I suggested, folding my arms.
The woman looked at me for a while. The wind ruffled my hair, bringing with it
the faint rumble of the city. Finally, she said, 'You are aware we could erase your
stack, and break down your sleeve into pieces so small there would be no trace.
There would, effectively, be nothing to find.'
'They'd find you,' I said, with the confidence that a strand of truth in the lie
provides. 'You can't hide from the Corps. They'll find you whatever you do.
About the only thing you can hope for now is to try to cut a deal.'
'What deal?' she asked woodenly.
In the fractions of a second before I spoke, my mind went into overdrive,
measuring the tilt and power of every syllable chosen before it was launched.
This was the escape window. There wouldn't be another chance.
'There's a biopirate operation moving stolen military custom through the West
Coast,' I said carefully. 'They're being fronted by places like Jerry's.'
'And they called the Envoys?' The woman's tone was scornful. 'For biopirates?
Come on, Ryker. Is that the best you can do?'
'I'm not Ryker,' I snapped. 'This sleeve's a cover. Look, you're right. Nine times
out often, this stuff doesn't touch us. The Corps wasn't designed to take on
criminality at that level. But these people have taken some items they should
never have touched. Rapid response diplomatic bioware. Stuff they should never
even have seen. Someone's pissed off about it — and I mean at UN Praesidium
level — so they call us in.'
The woman frowned. 'And the deal?'
'Well, first of all you cut me loose, and no one talks about this to anybody. Let's
call it a professional misunderstanding. And then you open some channels for
me. Name some names. Black clinic like this, the information circulates. That

might be worth something to me.'
'As I said before, we do not wish to involve ourselves — '
I came off the rail, letting just enough anger bleed through. 'Don't fuck with me,
pal. You are involved. Like it or not, you took a big bite of something that didn't
concern you, and now you're going to either chew it or spit it out. Which is it
going to be?'
Silence. Only the sea breeze between us, the faint rocking of the boat.
'We will consider this,' said the woman.
Something happened to the glinting light on the water. I shifted my gaze out past
the woman's shoulder and saw how the brightness unstitched itself from the
waves and scribbled into the sky, magnifying. The city whited out as if from a
nuclear flash, the edges of the boat faded, as if into a sea mist. The woman
opposite went with it. It became very quiet.
I raised a hand to touch the mist where the parameters of the world ended and
my arm seemed to move in slow motion. There was a static hiss like rain
building under the silence. The ends of my fingers turned transparent, then white
like the minarets of the city under the flash. I lost the power of motion and the
white crept up my arm. The breath stopped in my throat, my heart paused in
mid-beat. I was.
Not.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

I woke once more, this time to a rough numbness in the surface of my skin, like
the feeling your hands get just after you've rinsed them clean of detergent or
white spirit, but spread throughout the body. Re-entry into a male sleeve. It
subsided rapidly as my mind adjusted to the new nervous system. The faint chill
of air conditioning on exposed flesh. I was naked. I reached up with my left hand
and touched the scar under my eye.
They'd put me back.
Above me the ceiling was white and set with powerful spotlights. I propped
myself up on my elbows and looked around. Another faint chill, this one
internal, coasted through me as I saw that I was in an operating theatre. Across
the room from where I lay stood a polished steel surgical platform complete with
runnels for the blood and the folded arms of the autosurgeon suspended
spiderlike above. None of the systems were active, but there were small screens
blinking the word STANDBY on the wall and on a monitor unit beside me. I
leaned closer to the display and saw a function checklist scrolling down repeatedly. They had been programming the autosurgeon to take me apart.
I was swinging myself off the waiting tray when the door cracked open and the
synthetic woman came in with a pair of medics in tow. The particle blaster was
stowed at her hip and she was carrying a recognisable bundle.

'Clothes.' She flung them at me with a scowl. 'Get dressed.'
One of the medics laid a hand on her arm. 'Procedure calls for — '
'Yeah,' the woman sneered. 'Maybe he'll sue us. You don't think this place is up
to a simple De-and Re-, maybe I'll talk to Ray about moving our business
through someone else.'
'He's not talking about the re-sleeve,' I observed, pulling on my trousers. 'He
wants to check for interrogation trauma.'
'Who asked you?'
I shrugged. 'Suit yourself. Where are we going?'
'To talk to someone,' she said shortly and turned back to the medics. 'If he is who
he says he is, trauma isn't going to be an issue. And if he isn't, he's coming right
back here anyway.'
I continued dressing as smoothly as I could. Not out of the fire yet, then. My
crossover tunic and jacket were intact but the bandanna was gone, which
annoyed me out: of all proportion. I'd only bought it a few hours ago. No watch,
either. Deciding not to make an issue of it, I press-sealed my boots and stood up.
'So who are we going to see?'
The woman gave me a sour look. 'Someone who knows enough to check out
your shit. And then, personally, I think we'll be bringing you back here for
orderly dispersal.'
'When this is over,' I said evenly, 'maybe I can persuade one of our squads to pay
you a visit. In your real sleeve, that is. They'll want to thank you for your
support.'
The blaster came out of its sheath with a soft strop, and was under my chin. I
barely saw it happen. My recently re-sleeved senses scrabbled for a reaction,
aeons too late. The synthetic woman leaned close to the side of my face.
'Don't you ever threaten me, you piece of shit,' she said softly. 'You got these
clowns scared, they're anchored in place and they think you're carrying the

weight: to sink them. That doesn't work with me. Got it?'
I looked at her out of the corner of my eye, the best I could manage with my
head jammed up by the gun.
'Got it,' I said.
'Good,' she breathed, and removed the blaster. 'You check out with Ray, I'll line
up and apologise with everybody else. But until then you're just another potential
wipeout gibbering for your stack.'
At a rapid pace, we went down corridors that I tried to memorise and into a lift
identical to the one that had delivered me to the clinic. I counted the floors off
again, and when we stepped out into the parking area my eyes jerked
involuntarily to the door that they had taken Louise through. My recollections of
time during the torture were hazy — the Envoy conditioning was deliberately
curtaining off the experience to avert the trauma — but even if it had gone on a
couple of days, that was about ten minutes real time. I'd probably only been in
the clinic an hour or two maximum, and Louise's body might still be waiting for
the knife behind that door, her mind still stacked.
'Get in the car,' said the woman laconically.
This time my ride was a larger, more elegant machine, reminiscent of Bancroft's
limousine. There was already a driver in the forward cabin, liveried and shavenheaded with the bar code of his employer printed above his left ear. I'd seen quite
a few of these on the streets of Bay City, and wondered why anyone would
submit to it. On Harlan's World no one outside the military would be seen dead
with authorisation stripes. It was too close to the serfdom of the Settlement years
for comfort.
A second man stood by the rear cabin door, an ugly-looking machine pistol
dangling negligently from his hand. He too had the shaven skull and the bar
code. I looked hard at it as I passed him and got into the rear cabin. The
synthetic woman leaned down to talk to the chauffeur and I cranked up the
neurachem to eavesdrop.
' . . . head in the clouds. I want to be there before midnight.'
'No problem. Coastal's running light tonight and — '

One of the medics slammed the door shut on me and the solid clunk at max
amplification nearly blew my eardrums. I sat in silence, recovering, until the
woman and the machine pistoleer opened the doors on the other side and
climbed in next to me.
'Close your eyes,' the woman said, producing my bandanna. 'I'm going blindfold
you for a few minutes. If we do let you go, these guys aren't going to want you
knowing where to find them.'
I looked around at the windows. 'These look polarised to me anyway.'
'Yeah, but no telling how good that neurachem is, huh? Now hold still.'
She knotted the red cloth with practised efficiency and spread it a little to cover
my whole field of vision. I settled back in the seat.
'Couple of minutes. You just sit quiet and no peeking. I'll tell you when.'
The car boosted up and presumably out because I heard the drumming of rain
against the bodywork. There was a faint smell of leather from the upholstery,
which beat the odour of faeces on the inbound journey, and the seat I was in
moulded itself supportively to my form. I seemed to have moved up in the order
of things.
Strictly temporary, man. I smiled faintly as Jimmy's voice echoed in the back of
my skull. He was right. A couple of things were clear about whoever we were
going to see. This was someone who didn't want to come to the clinic, who didn't
even want to be seen near it. That bespoke respectability, and with it power, the
power to access off-world data. Pretty soon they were going to know that the
Envoy Corps was an empty threat, and very shortly after that I was going to be
dead. Really dead.
That kind of dictates the action, pal.
Thanks, Jimmy.
After a few minutes the woman told me to take off the blindfold. I pushed it up
onto my forehead and retied it there in its customary position. At my side, the
muscle with the machine pistol smirked. I gave him a curious look.

'Something funny?'
'Yeah.' The woman spoke without turning her gaze from the city lights beyond
the window. 'You look like a fucking idiot.'
'Not where I come from.'
She turned to look at me pityingly. 'You aren't where you come from. You're on
Earth. Try behaving like it.'
I looked from one to the other of them, the pistoleer still smirking, the synthetic
with the expression of polite contempt, then shrugged and reached up with both
hands to untie the bandanna. The woman went back to watching the lights of the
city sink below us. The rain seemed to have stopped.
I chopped down savagely from head height, left and right. My left fist jarred into
the pistoleer's temple with enough force to break the bone and he slumped
sideways with a single grunt. He never even saw the blow coming. My right arm
was still in motion.
The synthetic whipped around, probably faster than I could have struck, but she
misread me. Her arm was raised to block and cover her head, and I was under
the guard, reaching. My hand closed on the blaster at her belt, knocked out the
safety and triggered it. The beam seethed into life, cutting downwards, and a
large quantity of the woman's right leg burst open in wet ropes of flesh before
the blowback circuits cut the blast. She howled, a cry more of rage than of pain,
and then I dragged the muzzle of the weapon up, triggering another blast
diagonally across her body. The blaster carved a channel a handsbreadth wide
right through her and into the seat behind. Blood exploded across the cabin.
The blaster cut out again and the cabin went suddenly dim as the flaring of the
beam weapon stopped. Beside me, the synthetic woman bubbled and sighed, and
then the section of her torso that the head was attached to sagged away from the
left side of the body. Her forehead came to rest against the window she had been
looking out of. It looked oddly as if she was cooling her brow on the rain
streaked glass. The rest of the body sat stiffly upright, the massive sloping
wound cauterised clean by the beam. The mingled stink of cooked meat and
fried synthetic components was everywhere.
'Trepp? Trepp?' It was the chauffeur's intercom squawking. I wiped blood out of

my eyes and looked at the screen set in the forward bulkhead.
'She's dead,' I told the shocked face, and held up the blaster. 'They're both dead.
And you're next, if you don't get us on the ground right now.'
The chauffeur rallied. 'We're five hundred metres above the Bay, friend, and I'm
flying this car. What do you propose doing about that?'
I selected a mid-point on the wall between the two cabins, knocked out the
blowback cutout on the blaster and shielded my face with one hand.
'Hey, what are you — '
I fired through into the driver's compartment on tight focus. The beam punched a
molten hole about a centimetre wide and for a moment it rained sparks
backwards into the cabin as the armouring beneath the plastic resisted. Then the
sparks died as the beam broke through and I heard something electrical short out
in the forward compartment. I stopped firing.
'The next one goes right through your seat,' I promised. 'I've got friends who'll
re-sleeve me when they fish us out of the Bay. You I'll carve into steaks right
through this fucking wall, and even if I miss your stack, they'll have a hard time
finding which part of you it's inside, now fucking get me on the ground.'
The limousine banked abruptly to one side, losing altitude. I sat back a little
amidst the carnage and cleaned more blood off my face with one sleeve.
'That's good,' I said more calmly. 'Now set me down near Mission Street. And if
you're thinking about signalling for help, think about this. If there's a firefight,
you die first. Got it? You die first. I'm talking about real death. I'll make sure I
burn out your stack if it's the last thing I do before they take me down.'
His face looked back at me on the screen, pale. Scared, but not scared enough.
Or maybe scared of someone else. Anyone who bar-codes their employees isn't
likely to be the forgiving type, and the reflex of longheld obedience through
hierarchy is usually enough to overcome fear of a combat death. That's how you
fight wars, after all — with soldiers who are more afraid of stepping out of line
than they are of dying on the battlefield.
I used to be like that myself.

'How about this?' I offered rapidly. 'You violate traffic protocol putting us down.
The Sia turn up, bust you and hold you. You say nothing. I'm gone and they've
got nothing on you outside of a traffic misdemeanour. Your story is you're just
the driver, your passengers had a little disagreement in the back seat and then I
hijacked you to the ground. Meanwhile, whoever you work for bails you out
rapido and you pick up a bonus for not cracking in virtual holding.'
I watched the screen. His expression wavered, and he swallowed hard. Enough
carrot, time for the stick. I locked the blowback circuit on again, lifted the blaster
so he could see it and fitted it to the nape of Trepp's neck.
'I'd say you're getting a bargain.'
At point-blank range, the blaster beam vaporised spine, stack and everything
around it. I turned back to the screen.
'Your call.'
The driver's face convulsed, and the limo started to lose height raggedly. I
watched the flow of traffic through the window, then leaned forward and tapped
on the screen.
'Don't forget that violation, will you?'
He gulped and nodded. The limo dropped vertically through stacked lanes of
traffic and bumped hard along the ground, to a chorus of furious collision alert
screeches from the vehicles around us. Through the window I recognised the
street I'd cruised with Curtis the night before. Our pace slowed somewhat.
'Crack the nearside door,' I said, tucking the blaster under my jacket. Another
jerky nod and the door in question clunked open, then hung ajar. I swivelled,
kicked it wide and heard police sirens wailing somewhere above us. My eyes
met the driver's on the screen for a moment and I grinned.
'Wise man,' I said, and threw myself out of the coasting vehicle.
The pavement hit me in the shoulder and back as I rolled amidst startled cries
from passing pedestrians. I rolled twice, hit hard against a stone frontage and
climbed cautiously to my feet. A passing couple stared at me and I skinned my
teeth in a smile that made them huny on, finding interest in other shop fronts.

A stale blast of displaced air washed over me as a traffic cop's cruiser dropped in
the wake of the offending limo. I stayed where I was, giving back the
diminishing handful of curious looks from passers-by who had seen my unorthodox arrival. Interest in me was waning, in any case. One by one the stares
slipped away, drawn by the flashing lights of the police cruiser, now hovering
menacingly above and behind the stationary limo.
'Turn off your engines and remain where you are,' crackled the airborne speaker
system.
A crowd started to knot up as people hurried past me, jostling and trying to see
what was going on. I leaned back on the frontage, checking myself for damage
from the jump. By the feel of the fading numbness in my shoulder and across my
back, I'd done it right this time.
'Raise your hands above your head and step away from your vehicle,' came the
metallic voice of the traffic cop.
Over the bobbing heads of the spectators, I made out the driver, easing himself
out of the limo in the recommended posture. He looked relieved to be alive. For
a moment I caught myself wondering why that kind of stand-off wasn't more
popular in the circles I moved in.
Just: too many death wishes all round, I guess.
I backstepped a few metres in the mix of the crowd, then turned and slipped
away into the brightly lit anonymity of the Bay City night.

QUELLCRIST FALCONER
Things I Should Have Learnt by Now

Volume II

There was a cold blue dawn over the city by the time I got back to Licktown, and
everything had the wet gunmetal sheen of recent rain. I stood in the shadow of
the express-way pillars and watched the gutted street for any hint of movement.
There was a feeling I needed, but it wasn't easy to come by in the cold light of
the rising day. My head was buzzing with rapid data assimilation and Jimmy de
Soto floated around in the back of my mind like a restless demon familiar.
Where are you going, Tak?
To do some damage.
The Hendrix hadn't been able to give me anything on the clinic I'd been taken to.
From Deek's promise to the Mongolian to bring a disc of my torture right back
across, I supposed that the place had to be on the other side of the Bay, probably
in Oakland, but that in itself wasn't much help, even for an AI. The whole Bay
area appeared to be suffused with illegal biotech activity. I was going to have to
retrace my steps the hard way.
Jerry's Closed Quarters.
Here the Hendrix had been more helpful. After a brief skirmish with some lowgrade counter-intrusion systems, it laid out the biocabin club's entrails for me on
the screen in my room. Floor plan, security staffing, timetables and shifts. I
slammed through it in seconds, fuelled by the latent rage from my interrogation.
With the sky beginning to pale in the window behind me, I fitted the Nemex and
the Philips gun in their holsters, strapped on the Tebbit knife, and went out to do
some interrogating of my own.
I'd seen no sign of my tail when I let myself into the hotel, and he didn't seem to
be around when I left either. Lucky for him, I guess.

Jerry's Closed Quarters by dawn light.
What little cheap erotic mystique had clung to the place by night was gone now.
The neon and holosigns were bleached out, pinned on the building like a garish
brooch on an old gown. I looked bleakly at the dancing girl, still trapped in the
cocktail glass, and thought of Louise, alias Anenome, tortured to a death her
religion would not let her come back from.
Make it personal.
The Nemex was in my right hand like a decision taken. As I walked towards the
club, I worked the slide action on it and the metallic snap was loud in the quiet
morning air. A slow, cold fury was beginning to fill me up now.
The door robot stirred as I approached and its arms came up in a warding-off
gesture.
'We're closed, friend,' the synth voice said.
I levelled the Nemex at the lintel and shot out the robot's brain dome. The casing
might have stopped smaller calibre shells, but the Nemex slugs smashed the unit
to pieces. Sparks fireworked abruptly and the synth voice shrieked. The
concertina octopus arms thrashed spastically, then went slack. Smoke curled
from the shattered lintel housing.
Cautiously, I prodded one dangling tentacle aside with the Nemex, stepped
through and met Milo coming upstairs to find out what the noise was about. His
eyes widened as he saw me.
'You. What — '
I shot him through the throat, watched him flap and tumble down the steps and
then, as he struggled to get back on his feet, shot him again in the face. As I went
down the stairs after Milo a second heavy appeared in the dimly lit space below
me, took one shocked look at Milo's corpse and went for a clumsy-looking
blaster at his belt. I nailed him twice through the chest before his ringers touched
the weapon.
At the bottom of the stairs I paused, unholstered the Philips gun left-handed and
stood in silence for a moment, letting the echoes of the gunfire die away in my

ears. The heavy artillery rhythm that I'd come to expect of Jerry's was still
playing but the Nemex had a loud voice. On my left was the pulsing red glow of
the corridor that led to the cabins, on the right a spiderweb holo with a variety of
pipes and bottles trapped in it and the word BAR illuminumed onto flat black
doors beyond. The data in my head said a minimal security presence for the
cabins — three at most, more likely down to two at this time of the morning.
Milo and the nameless heavy on the stairs down, leaving one more possible. The
bar was soundproofed off, wired into a separate sound system and running
between two and four armed guards who doubled as bar staff.
Jerry the cheapskate.
I listened, cranking up the neurachem. From the corridor that led left I heard one
of the cabin doors open stealthily and then the soft scrape of someone sliding
their feet along the ground in the mistaken belief that it would make less noise
than walking. Keeping my eyes fixed on the bar doors to my right, I stuck the
Philips gun round the corner to the left and, without bothering to look, sewed a
silent scribble of bullets across the red lit air in the corridor. The weapon seemed
to sigh them out like branches blowing in a breeze. There was a strangled grunt,
and then the thud and clatter of a body and weapon hitting the floor.
The doors to the bar remained closed.
I eased my head round the angle of the wall and in the stripes of red thrown by
the rotating lights saw a stocky-looking woman in combat fatigues clutching at
her side with one arm and clawing after a fallen handgun with the other. I
stepped quickly across to the weapon and kicked it well out of her reach, then
knelt beside her. I must have scored multiple hits; there was blood on her legs
and her shirt was drenched in it. I laid the muzzle of the Philips gun against her
forehead.
'You work security for Jerry?'
She nodded, eyes flaring white around her irises.
'One chance. Where is he?'
'Bar,' she hissed through her teeth, fighting back the pain. 'Table. Back corner.'
I nodded, stood up and sighted carefully between her eyes.

'Wait, you — '
The Philips gun sighed.
Damage.
I was in the midst of the spiderweb holo, reaching for the bar doors, when they
swung open and I found myself face to face with Deck. He had even less time to
react to the phantom before him than Milo had. I tipped him the tiniest of formal
bows, barely an inclination of my head, and then let go of the fury inside me and
shot him repeatedly at waist height with both Nemex and Philips gun. He
staggered back through the doors under the multiple impacts and I followed him
in, still firing.
It was a wide space, dimly lit by angled spots and the subdued orange guide
lights of the dancers' runway, now abandoned. Along one wall, cool blue light
shone up from behind the bar, as if it was fronting an obscure downward
staircase to paradise. Behind was racked with the pipes, jack-ins and bottles on
offer. The keeper of this angel's hoard took one look at Deck, reeling backwards
with his hands sunk in his ruined guts, and went for the holdout below the bar at
a speed that was truly semi-divine.
I heard the dropped glass shatter, threw out the Nemex and hammered him back
against the displayed wares on the wall like an impromptu crucifixion. He hung
there a moment, curiously elegant, then turned and clawed down a racket of
bottles and pipes on his way to the floor. Deek went down too, still moving, and
a dim, bulky-looking form leaned against the edge of the runway leapt forward,
clearing a handgun from the waist. I left the Nemex focused on the bar — no
time to turn and aim — and snapped off a shot from the Philips gun, half-raised.
The figure grunted and staggered, losing his weapon and slumping against the
runway. My left arm raised, straightened and the head shot punched him back
onto the dance platform.
The Nemex echoes were still dying in the corners of the room.
By now I had sight of Jerry. He was ten metres away, surging to his feet behind a
flimsy table when I levelled the Nemex. He froze.
'Wise man.' The neurachem was singing like wires, and there was an adrenalin
grin hanging crazily off my face. My mind rattled through the count. One shell

left in the Philips gun, six in the Nemex. 'Leave your hands right there, and sit
the rest of you down. You twitch a finger and I'll take it off at the wrist.'
He sank back into his seat, face working. Peripheral scan told me there was no
one else moving in the room. I stepped carefully over Deek, who had rolled into
a foetal ball around the damage in his gut and was giving out a deep, agonised
wailing. Keeping the Nemex focused on the table in front of Jerry's groin, I
dropped my other arm until the Philips gun was pointing straight down and
pulled the trigger. The noise from Deek stopped.
At this, Jerry erupted.
'Are you fucking crazy, Ryker? Stop it! You can't — '
I jerked the Nemex barrel at him and either that or something in my face shut
him up. Nothing stirred behind the curtains at the end of the runway, nothing
behind the bar. The doors stayed closed. Crossing the remaining distance to
Jerry's table, I kicked one of the chairs around backwards and then straddled it,
facing him.
'You, Jerry,' I said evenly, 'need to listen to people occasionally. I've told you, my
name is not Ryker.'
'Whoever the fuck you are, I'm connected.' There was so much venom on the
face before me it was a wonder Jerry didn't choke on it. 'I'm jacked into the
fucking machine, you get me? This. All this. You're going to fucking pay. You're
going to wish — '
'I'd never met you,' I finished for him. I stowed the empty Philips gun back in its
Fibregrip holster. 'Jerry, I already wish I'd never met you. Your sophisticated
friends were sophisticated enough for that. But I notice they didn't tell you I was
back on the street. Not so tight with Ray these days, is that it?'
I was watching his face, and the name didn't register. Either he was very cool
under fire, or he genuinely wasn't fishing in the senior fleet. I tried again.
'Trepp's dead,' I said casually. His eyes moved, just a fraction. 'Trepp, and a few
others. Want to know why you're still alive?'
His mouth tightened, but he said nothing. I leaned over the table and pushed the

barrel of the Nemex up against his left eye.
'I asked you a question.'
'Fuck you.'
I nodded and settled back onto my seat. 'Hard man, huh? So I'll tell you. I need
some answers, Jerry. You can start by telling me what happened to Elizabeth
Elliott. That should be easy, I figure you carved her up yourself. Then I want to
know who Elias Ryker is, who Trepp works for, and where the clinic is that you
sent me to.'
'Fuck you.'
'You don't think I'm serious? Or are you just hoping the cops are going to show
up and save your stack?' I fished the commandeered blaster out of my pocket
left-handed and drew a careful bead on the dead security guard on the runway.
The range was short and the beam torched his head off in a single explosion. The
stench of charred flesh rolled across the room to us. Keeping one eye on Jerry, I
played the beam around a little until I was sure I'd destroyed everything from the
shoulders up, then snapped the weapon off and lowered it. Jerry stared at me
over the table.
'You piece of shit, he only worked security for me!'
'That's just: become a proscribed profession, as far as I'm concerned. Deck and
the rest are going the same way. And so are you, unless you tell me what I want
to know.' I lifted the beam weapon. 'One chance.'
'All right.' The crack was audible in his voice. 'All right, all right. Elliott tried to
put a lock on a customer, she got some big name Meth come slumming down
here, reckoned she'd got enough shit to twist him. Stupid cunt tried to make me a
partnership deal, she figured I could lean on this Meth guy. No fucking clue what
she was dealing with.'
'No.' I looked stonily at him across the table. 'I guess not.'
He caught the look. 'Hey, man, I know what you're thinking, but it ain't like that.
I tried to warn her off, so she went direct. Direct to a fucking Meth. You think I
wanted this place ripped down and me buried under it. I had to deal with her,

man. Had to.'
'You iced her?'
He shook his head. 'I made a call,' he said in a subdued voice. 'That's how it
works around here.'
'Who's Ryker?'
'Ryker's a — ,' he swallowed. ' — a cop. Used to work Sleeve Theft, then they
upped him to the Organic Damage Division. He was fucking that Sia cunt, the
one came out here the night you crocked Oktai.'
'Ortega?'
'Yeah, Ortega. Everybody knew it, they say that's how he got the transfer. That's
why we figured you were — he was — back on the street. When Deck saw you
talking to Ortega we figured she'd accessed someone, done a deal.'
'Back on the street? Back from where?'
'Ryker was dirty, man.' Now the flow had started, it was coming in full flood. 'He
RD'd a couple of sleevedealers, up in Seattle — '
'RD?'
'Yeah, RD'd.'Jerry looked momentarily nonplussed, as if I'd just queried the
colour of the sky.
'I'm not from here,' I said patiently.
'RD. Real Death. He pulped them, man. Couple of other guys went down stack
intact so Ryker paid off some Dipper to register the lot of them Catholic. Either
the input didn't take, or someone at OrgDam found out. He got the double barrel.
Two hundred years, no remission. Word is, Ortega headed up the squad that took
him down.'
Well, well. I waved the Nemex encouragingly.
'That's it, man. All I got. It's off the wire. Street: talk. Look, Ryker never shook

this place down, even back when he worked ST. I run a clean house. I never even
met the guy.'
'And Oktai?'
Jerry nodded vigorously. 'That's it, Oktai. Oktai used to run spare part deals out
of Oakland. You, I mean, Ryker used to shake him down all the time. Beat him
half to death couple of years back.'
'So Oktai comes running to you — '
'That's it. He's like, crazy, saying Ryker must be working some scam down here.
So we run the cabin tapes, get you talking to — '
Jerry dried up as he saw where we were heading. I gestured again with the gun.
'That's fucking it.' There was an edge of desperation in his voice.
'All right.' I sat back a little and patted my pockets for cigarettes, remembered I
had none. 'You smoke?'
'Smoke? Do I look like a fucking idiot?'
I sighed. 'Never mind. What about Trepp? She looked a little upmarket for your
cred. Who'd you borrow her from?'
'Trepp's an indie. Contract hire for whoever. She does me favours sometimes.'
'Not any more. You ever see her real sleeve?'
'No. Wire says she keeps it on ice in New York most of the time.'
'That far from here?'
' 'Bout an hour, suborbital.'
By my reckoning that put her in the same league as Kadmin. Global muscle,
maybe Interplanetary too. The Senior Fleet.
'So who's the wire say she's working for now?'

'I don't know.'
I studied the barrel of the blaster as if it were a Martian relic. 'Yeah, you do.' I
looked up and offered him a bleak smile. 'Trepp's gone. Unstacked, the works.
You don't need to worry about selling her out. You need to worry about me.'
He stared defiantly at me for a couple of moments, then looked down.
'I heard she was doing stuff for the Houses.'
'Good. Now, tell me about the clinic. Your sophisticated friends.'
The Envoy training should have been keeping my voice even, but maybe I was
getting rusty because Jerry heard something there. He moistened his lips.
'Listen, those are dangerous people. You got away, you'd better just leave it at
that. You got no idea what they — '
'I've got a pretty good idea, actually.' I pointed the blaster into his face. 'The
clinic.'
'Christ, they're just people I know. You know, business associates. They can use
the spare parts, sometimes, and I — ' He changed tack abruptly as he saw my
face. 'They do stuff for me sometimes. It's just business.'
I thought of Louise, alias Anenome, and the journey we'd taken together. I felt a
muscle beneath my eye twitch, and it was all I could do not to pull the trigger
there and then. I dug up my voice, instead, and used it. It sounded more like a
machine than the door robot had.
'We're going for a ride, Jerry. Just you and me, to visit your business associates.
And don't fuck with me. I've already figured out it's over the other side of the
Bay. And I've got a good memory for places. You steer me wrong, and I'll RD
you on the spot. Got it?'
From his face I judged that he did.
But just to make sure, on the way out of the club I stopped beside each corpse
and burnt its head off down to the shoulders. The burning left an acrid stench
that followed us out of the gloom and into the early morning street like a ghost

of rage.

There's a village up on the north arm of the Millsport archipelago where, if a
fisherman survives drowning, he is required to swim out to a low reef about half
a kilometre from shore, spit into the ocean beyond and return. Sarah's from there,
and once, holed up in a cheap swamp hotel, hiding from heat both physical and
figurative, she tried to explain the rationale. It always sounded like macho
bullshit to me.
Now, marching down the sterile white corridors of the clinic once again, with the
muzzle of my own Philips gun screwed into my neck, I began to have some
understanding of the strength it must take to wade back into that water. I'd had
cold shivers since we went down in the lift: for the second time, Jerry holding
the gun on me from behind. After Innenin, I'd more or less forgotten what it was
like to be genuinely afraid, but virtualities were a notable exception. There, you
had no control, and literally anything could happen.
Again and again.
They were rattled at the clinic. The news of Trepp's barbecue ride must have
reached them by now, and the face that Jerry had spoken to on the screen at the
discreetly appointed front door had gone death white at the sight of me.
'We thought — '
'Never mind that,' snapped Jerry. 'Open the fucking door. We've got to get this
piece of shit off the street.'
The clinic was part of an old turn-of-the-millennium block that someone had
renovated in neo-industrial style, doors painted with heavy black and yellow
chevrons, facades draped in scaffolding and balconies hung with fake cabling
and hoists. The door before us divided along the upward points of the chevrons
and slid noiselessly apart. With a last glance at the early morning street, Jerry
thrust me inside.
The entrance hall was also neoind, more scaffolding along the walls and patches
of exposed brickwork. A pair of security guards were waiting at the end. One of
them put out a hand as we approached, and Jerry swung on him, snarling.

'I don't need any fucking help. You're the wipeouts that let this motherfucker go
in the first place.'
The two guards exchanged a glance and the extended grasp turned into a
placatory gesture. They conveyed us to an elevator door that proved to be the
same commercial-capacity shaft I'd ridden down from the car park on the roof
last time. When we came out at the bottom, the same medical team were waiting,
sedating implements poised. They looked edgy, tired. Butt end of the night shift.
When the same nurse moved to hypo me, Jerry brought out the snarl again. He
had it down to perfection.
'Never fucking mind that.' He screwed the Philips gun harder into my neck. 'He
isn't going anywhere. I want to see Miller.'
'He's in surgery.'
'Surgery?' Jerry barked a laugh. 'You mean he's watching the machine make pick
and mix. All right, Chung, then.'
The team hesitated.
'What? Don't tell me you got all your consultants working for a living this
morning.'
'No, it's . . . ' The man nearest me gestured. 'It's not procedure, taking him in
awake.'
'Don't fucking tell me about procedure.' Jerry did a good impression of a man
about to explode with fury. 'Was it procedure to let this piece of shit get out and
wreck my place after I sent him over here? Was that fucking procedure? Was it?'
There was silence. I looked at the blaster and Nemex, shoved into Jerry's
waistband, and measured the angles. Jerry took a renewed grip on my collar and
ground the gun under my jaw once again. He glared at the medics and spoke
with a kind of gritted calm.
'He ain't moving. Got it? There isn't time for this bullshit. We are going to see
Chung. Now, move.'
They bought it. Anyone would have. You pile on the pressure, and most people

fall back on response. They give in to the higher authority, or the man with the
gun. These people were tired and scared. We double-timed it down the corridors.
Past the operating theatre I had woken up in, or one like it. I caught a glimpse of
figures gathered around the surgery platform, the autosurgeon moving spiderlike
above them. We were a dozen paces further along when someone stepped into
the corridor behind us.
'Just a moment.' The voice was cultured, almost leisurely, but it brought the
medics and Jerry up short. We turned to face a tall, blue-smocked figure wearing
bloodstained spray-on surgical gloves and a mask which he now unpinned with
one fastidious thumb and forefinger. The visage beneath was blandly handsome,
blue eyes in a tanned, square-jawed face, this year's Competent Male, courtesy
of some upmarket cosmetic salon.
'Miller,' said Jerry.
'What exactly is going on here? Courault,' the tall man turned to the female
medic, 'you know better than to bring subjects through here unsedated.'
'Yes, sir. Mr Sedaka insisted that there was no risk involved. He said he was in a
hurry. To see director Chung.'
'I don't care how much of a hurry he's in.' Miller swung on Jerry, eyes narrowing
with suspicion. 'Are you insane, Sedaka? What do you think this is, the visitors'
gallery? I've got clients in there. Recognisable faces. Courault, sedate this man
immediately.'
Oh, well. No one's lucky for ever.
I was already moving. Before Courault could lift the hypospray from her hip
sack, I yanked both the Nemex and the blaster from Jerry's waistband and spun,
firing. Courault and her two colleagues went down, multiply injured. Blood
splattered on antiseptic white behind them. Miller had time for one outraged yell
and then I shot him in the mouth with the Nemex. Jerry was just backing away
from me, the unloaded Philips gun still dangling from his hand. I threw up the
blaster.
'Look, I did my fucking best, I — '
The beam cut loose and his head exploded.

In the sudden quiet that followed, I retraced my steps to the doors of the surgery
and pushed through them. The little knot of figures, immaculately suited to a
man and woman, had left the table on which a young female sleeve was laid out,
and were gaping at me behind forgotten surgical masks. Only the autosurgeon
continued working unperturbed, making smooth incisions and cauterising
wounds with abrupt little sizzlings. Indistinct lumps of raw red poked out of an
array of small metal dishes collected at the subject's head. It looked unnervingly
like the start of some arcane banquet.
The woman on the table was Louise.
There were five men and women in the theatre, and I killed them all while they
stared at me. Then I shot the autosurgeon to pieces with the blaster, and raked
the beam over the rest of the equipment in the room. Alarms sirened into life
from every wall. In the storm of their combined shrieking, I went round and
inflicted Real Death on everyone there.
Outside, there were more alarms and two of the medical crew were still alive.
Courault had succeeded in crawling a dozen metres down the corridor in a broad
trail of her own blood, and one of her male colleagues, too weak to escape, was
trying to prop himself up against the wall. The floor was slippery under him and
he kept sliding back down. I ignored him and went after the woman. She stopped
when she heard my footsteps, twisted her head to look round and then began to
crawl again, frantically. I stamped a foot down between her shoulders to make
her stop and then kicked her onto her back.
We looked at each other for a long moment while I remembered her impassive
face as she had put me under the night before. I lifted the blaster for her to see.
'Real Death,' I said, and pulled the trigger.
I walked back to the remaining medic who had seen and was now scrabbling
desperately backwards away from me. I crouched down in front of him. The
screaming of the alarms rose and fell over our heads like lost souls.
'Jesus Christ,' he moaned as I pointed the blaster at his face. 'Jesus Christ, I only
work here.'
'Good enough,' I told him.

The blaster was almost inaudible against the alarms.
Working rapidly, I took care of the third medic in similar fashion, dealt with
Miller a little more at length, stripped Jerry's headless corpse of its jacket and
tacked the garment under my arm. Then I scooped up the Philips gun, tacked it
into my waistband and left. On my way out along the screaming corridors of the
clinic, I killed every person that I met, and melted their stacks to slag.
Personal.
The police were landing on the roof as I let myself out of the front door and
walked unhurriedly down the street. Under my arm, Miller's severed head was
beginning to seep blood through the lining of Jerry's jacket.

PART 3 : ALLIANCE
(APPLICATION UPGRADE)

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

It was quiet and sunny in the gardens at Suntouch House, and the air smelled of
mown grass. From the tennis courts came the faint popping of a game in
progress and once I heard Miriam Bancroft's voice raised in excitement. Flash of
tanned legs beneath a flaring white skirt and a puff of shell-pink dust where the
driven ball buried itself in the back of her opponent's court. There was a polite
ripple of applause from the seated figures watching. I made my way down
towards the courts, flanked by heavily armed security men with blank faces.
The players were taking a game break when I arrived, feet planted wide in front
of their seats, heads down. As my feet crunched on the gravel surround, Miriam
Bancroft looked up through tangled blonde hair and met my eye. She said
nothing, but her hands worked at the handle of her racket and a smile split her
lips. Her opponent, who also glanced up, was a slim young man with something
about him that suggested he might genuinely be as young as his body. He looked
vaguely familiar.
Bancroft was seated at the middle of a row of deck chairs, Oumou Prescott on
his right and a man and woman I'd never met on his left. He didn't get up when I
reached him; in fact he barely looked at me. One hand gestured to the seat next
to Prescott.
'Sit down, Kovacs. It's the last game.'

I twitched a smile, resisting the temptation to kick his teeth down his throat, and
folded myself into the deck chair. Oumou Prescott leaned across to me and
murmured behind her hand.
'Mr Bancroft has had some unwanted attention from the police today. You are
being less subtle than we had hoped.'
'Just warming up,' I muttered back.
By some prior agreed time limit, Miriam Bancroft and her opponent shrugged
off their towels and took up position. I settled back and watched the play, eyes
mostly on the woman's taut body as it surged and swung within the white cotton,
remembering how it looked unclothed, how it had writhed against me. Once, just
before a service, she caught me looking at her and her mouth bent in fractional
amusement. She was still waiting for an answer from me, and now she thought
she had it. When the match finished, in a flurry of hard-fought but visibly
inevitable points, she came off court glowing.
She was talking to the man and woman I didn't know when I approached to offer
my congratulations. She saw me coming and turned to include me in the little
group.
'Mr Kovacs.' Her eyes widened the slightest bit. 'Did you enjoy watching?'
'Very much,' I said truthfully. 'You're quite merciless.'
She tipped her head on one side and began to towel her sweat-soaked hair with
one hand. 'Only when required,' she said. 'You won't know Nalan or Joseph, of
course. Nalan, Joseph, this is Takeshi Kovacs, the Envoy Laurens hired to look
into his murder. Mr Kovacs is from offworld. Mr Kovacs, this is Nalan Ertekin,
Chief Justice of the UN Supreme Court, and Joseph Phiri from the Commission
of Human Rights.'
'Delighted.' I made a brief formal bow to both of them. 'You're here to discuss
Resolution 653, I imagine.'
The two officials exchanged a glance, then Phiri nodded. 'You're very well
informed,' he said gravely. 'I've heard a lot about the Envoy Corps, but still I'm
impressed. How long have you been on Earth, exactly?'

'About a week.' I exaggerated, hoping to play down the usual paranoia elected
officials exhibit around Envoys.
'A week, yes. Impressive indeed.' Phiri was a heavy-set black man, apparently in
his fifties, with hair that was greying a little and careful brown eyes. Like Dennis
Nyman, he affected external eye-wear, but where Nyman's steely lenses had
been designed to enhance the planes of his face, this man wore the glasses to
deflect attention. They were heavy-framed and gave him the appearance of a
forgetful cleric, but behind the lenses, the eyes missed nothing.
'And are you making progress with your investigation?' This was Ertekin, a
handsome Arab woman a couple of decades younger than Phiri, and therefore
likely to be on at least her second sleeve. I smiled at her.
'Progress is difficult to define, your honour. As Quell would have it, They come
to me with progress reports, but all I see is change, and bodies burnt.'
'Ah, you are from Harlan's World, then,' Ertekin said politely. 'And do you
consider yourself a Quellist, Mr Kovacs?'
I let the smile become a grin. 'Sporadically. I'd say she had a point.'
'Mr Kovacs has been quite busy, in fact,' said Miriam Bancroft hurriedly. 'I
imagine he and Laurens have a lot to discuss. Perhaps it might be better if we
left them to these matters.'
'Yes, of course.' Ertekin inclined her head. 'Perhaps we'll talk again later.'
The three of them drifted over to commiserate with Miriam's opponent, who was
ruefully stowing his racket and towels in a bag; but for all Miriam's diplomatic
steerage, Nalan Ertekin did not seem unduly concerned to make her escape. I felt
a momentary glimmer of admiration for her. Telling a UN executive, in effect an
officer of the Protectorate, that you're a Quellist is a bit like confessing to ritual
slaughter at a vegetarian dinner; it's not really the done thing.
I turned to find Oumou Prescott at my shoulder.
'Shall we?' she said grimly, and pointed up towards the house. Bancroft was
already striding ahead. We went after him at what I thought was an excessive
pace.

'One question,' I managed, between breathing. 'Who's the kid? The one Mrs
Bancroft crucified.'
Prescott flicked me an impatient glance.
'Big secret, huh?'
'No, Mr Kovacs, it is not a secret, large or otherwise. I merely think you might
do better occupying your mind with other matters than the Bancrofts' house
guests. If you must know, the other player was Marco Kawahara.'
'Was it, indeed.' Accidentally, I'd slipped into Phiri's speech patterns. Chalk up a
double strike for personality. 'So that's where I've seen his face before. Takes
after his mother, doesn't he?'
'I really wouldn't know,' said Prescott dismissively. 'I have never met Ms
Kawahara.'
'Lucky you.'
Bancroft was waiting for us in an exotic conservatory pinned to the seaward
wing of the house. The glass walls were a riot of alien colours and forms, among
which I picked out a young mirrorwood tree and numerous stands of
martyrweed. Bancroft was standing next to one of the latter, spraying it carefully
with a white metallic dust. I don't know much about martyrweed beyond its
obvious uses as a security device, so I had no idea what the powder was.
Bancroft turned as we came in. 'Please keep your voices reasonably low.' His
own voice was curiously flat in the sound absorbent environment. 'Martyrweed
is highly sensitive at this stage of development. Mr Kovacs, I assume you are
familiar with it.'
'Yeah.' I glanced at the vaguely hand-shaped cups of the leaves, with the central
crimson stains that had given the plant its name. 'You sure these are mature?'
'Fully. On Adoracion, you'll have seen them larger, but I had Nakamura tailor
these for indoor use. This is as secure as a Nilvibe cabin and,' he gestured to a
trio of steel frame chairs beside the martyrweed, 'a great deal more comfortable.'
'You wanted to see me,' I said impatiently. 'What about?'

For just a moment that black iron stare bent on me with the full force of
Bancroft's three and a half centuries, and it was like locking gazes with a demon.
For that second, the Meth soul was looking out and I saw reflected in those eyes
all the myriad ordinary single lives that they had watched die, like the pale
flickerings of moths at a flame. It was an experience I'd only had once before,
and that was when I'd taken issue with Reileen Kawahara. I could feel the heat
on my wings.
Then it was gone, and there was only Bancroft, moving to seat himself and
setting the powder spray aside on an adjacent table. He looked up and waited to
see if I would sit down as well. When I did not, he steepled his fingers and
frowned. Oumou Prescott hovered between us.
'Mr Kovacs, I am aware that by the terms of our contract I agreed to meet all
reasonable expenses in this investigation, but when I said that, I did not expect to
be paying for a trail of wilful organic damage from one side of Bay City to
another. I have spent most of this morning buying off both the West Coast triads
and the Bay City police, neither of whom were very well disposed towards me
even before you started this carnage. I wonder if you realise how much it is
costing me just to keep you alive and out of storage.'
I looked around at the conservatory and shrugged.
'I imagine you can afford it.'
Prescott flinched. Bancroft allowed himself the splinter of a smile.
'Perhaps, Mr Kovacs, I no longer wish to afford it.'
'Then pull the fucking plug.' The martyrweed trembled visibly at the sudden
change in tone. I didn't care. Abruptly, I was no longer in the mood for playing
the Bancrofts' elegant games. I was tired. Discounting the brief period of
unconsciousness at the clinic, I had been awake for over thirty hours and my
nerves were raw from the continual use of the neurachem system. I had been in a
firefight. I had escaped from a moving aircar. I had been subjected to
interrogation routines that would have traumatised most human beings for a
lifetime. I had committed multiple combat murders. And I had been in the act of
crawling into bed when the Hendrix let Bancroft's curt summons through the call
block I'd requested, quote, 'in the interests of maintaining good client relations
and so assuring continued guest status'. Someday, someone was going to have to

overhaul the hotel's antique service industry idiolect; I had weighed the idea of
doing it myself with the Nemex when I got off the phone, but my irritation at the
hotel's enslaved responses to guest-holding was overridden by the anger I felt
towards Bancroft himself. It was that anger that had stopped me ignoring the call
and going to bed anyway, and propelled me out to Suntouch House dressed in
the same rumpled clothes I had been wearing since the previous day.
'I beg your pardon, Mr Kovacs?' Oumou Prescott was staring at me. 'Are you
suggesting — '
'No, I'm not, Prescott. I'm threatening.' I switched my gaze back to Bancroft. 'I
didn't ask to join this fucking No dance. You dragged me here, Bancroft. You
pulled me out of the store on Harlan’s World and you jacked me into Elias
Ryker's sleeve just to piss Ortega off. You sent me out there with a few vague
hints and watched me stumble around in the dark, cracking my shins on your
past misdemeanours. Well, if you don't want to play any more, now the current's
running a little hard, that's fine with me. I'm through risking my stack for a piece
of shit like you. You can just put me back in the box, and I'll take my chances a
hundred and seventeen years from now. Maybe I'll get lucky, and whoever wants
you toasted will have wiped you off the face of the planet by then.'
I'd had to check my weapons at the main gate, but I could feel the dangerous
looseness of the Envoy combat mode stealing over me as I spoke. If the Meth
demon came back and got out of hand, I was going to choke the life out of
Bancroft there and then just for the satisfaction.
Curiously, what I said only seemed to make him thoughtful. He heard me out,
inclined his head as if in agreement, then turned to Prescott.
'Ou, can you drop out for a while. There are some things that Mr Kovacs and I
need to discuss in private.'
Prescott looked dubious. 'Shall I post someone outside?' she queried, with a hard
glance at me. Bancroft shook his head.
'I'm sure that won't be necessary.'
Prescott left, looking dubious, while I struggled not to admire Bancroft's cool.
He'd just heard me say I was happy to go back into storage, he'd been reading
my body count all morning, and still he thought he had my specs down tight

enough to know whether I was dangerous or not.
I took a seat. Maybe he was right.
'You've got some explaining to do,' I said evenly. 'You can start with Ryker's
sleeve, and go on from there. Why'd you do it, and why conceal it from me?'
'Conceal it?' Bancroft's brows arched. 'We barely discussed it.'
'You told me you'd left the sleeve selection to your lawyers. You were at pains to
stress that. But Prescott insists you made the selection yourself. You should have
briefed her a bit better on the lies you were going to tell.'
'Well.' Bancroft made a gesture of acceptance. 'A reflexive caution, then. One
tells the truth to so few people in the end, it becomes a habit. But I had no idea it
would matter to you so much. After your career in the Corps, and your time in
storage, I mean. Do you usually exhibit this much interest in the past history of
the sleeves you wear?'
'No, I don't. But ever since I arrived, Ortega's been all over me like
anticontaminant plastic. I thought it was because she had something to hide.
Turns out, she's just trying to protect her boyfriend's sleeve while he's in the
store. Incidentally, did you bother to find out why Ryker was on stack?'
This time Bancroft's open-handed motion was dismissive. 'A corruption charge.
Unjustified organic damage, and attempted falsification of personality detail. I
understand it wasn't his first offence.'
'Yeah, that's right. In fact he was well known for it. Well known and very
unpopular, especially around places like Licktown, which is where I've been the
last couple of days, following the trail of your dripping dick. But we'll come
back to that. I want to know why you did it. Why am I wearing Ryker's sleeve?'
Bancroft's eyes flared momentarily at the insult, but he really was too good a
player to rise to it. Instead, he shot his right cuff in a displacement gesture I
recognised from Diplomatic Basic, and smiled faintly.
'Really, I had no idea it would prove inconvenient. I was looking to provide you
with suitable armour, and the sleeve carries — '

'Why Ryker?'
There was a beat of silence. Meths were not people you interrupted lightly, and
Bancroft was having a hard time dealing with the lack of respect. I thought about
the tree beyond the tennis courts. No doubt Ortega, had she been there, would
have cheered.
'A move, Mr Kovacs. Merely a move.'
'A move? Against Ortega?'
'Just so.' Bancroft settled back into his seat. 'Lieutenant Ortega made her
prejudices quite clear the moment she stepped into this house. She was unhelpful
in the extreme. She lacked respect. It was something that I remembered, an
account to be adjusted. When the shortlist Oumou provided me with included
Elias Ryker's sleeve, and listed Ortega as paying the tank mortgage, I saw the
move as almost karmic. It dictated itself.'
'A little childish for someone your age, don't you think?'
Bancroft inclined his head. 'Perhaps. But then, do you recall a General Maclntyre
of Envoy Command, resident of Harlan's World, who was found gutted and
decapitated in his private jet a year after the Innenin massacre?'
'Vaguely.' I sat, cold, remembering. But if Bancroft could play the control game,
so could I.
'Vaguely?' Bancroft raised an eyebrow. 'I'd have thought a veteran of Innenin
could scarcely fail to recall the death of the commander who presided over the
whole debacle, the man many claim was actually guilty by negligence of all
those Real Deaths.'
'Maclntyre was exonerated of all blame by the Protectorate Court of Inquiry,' I
said quietly. 'Do you have a point to make?'
Bancroft shrugged. 'Only that it seems his death was a revenge killing, despite
the verdict handed down by the court, a pointless act, in fact, since it could not
bring back those who died. Childishness is a common enough sin amongst
humans. Perhaps we should not be so quick to judge.'

'Perhaps not.' I stood up and went to stand at the door of the conservatory,
looking out. 'Well, then don't feel that I'm sitting in judgement, but why exactly
didn't you tell me you spent so much time in whorehouses?'
'Ah, the Elliott girl. Yes, Oumou has told me about this. Do you seriously think
her father had something to do with my death?'
I turned back. 'Not now, no. I seriously believe he had nothing to do with your
death, in fact. But I've wasted a lot of time finding that out.'
Bancroft met my eye calmly. 'I'm sorry if my briefing was inadequate, Mr
Kovacs. It is true, I spend some of my leisure time in purchased sexual release,
both real and virtual. Or, as you so elegantly put it, whorehouses. I'd not
considered it especially important. Equally, I spend part of my time in smallscale gambling. And occasionally null-gravity knife fighting. All of these things
could make me enemies, as indeed could most of my business interests. I didn't
feel that your first day in a new sleeve on a new world was the time for a lineby-line explanation of my life. Where would I expect to begin? Instead, I told
you the background of the crime and suggested that you talk to Oumou. I didn't
expect you to take off after the first clue like a heatseeker. Nor did I expect you
to lay waste everything that got in your way. I was told the Envoy Corps had a
reputation for subtlety.'
Put like that, he had a point. Virginia Vidaura would have been furious, she
probably would have been right behind Bancroft, waiting to deck me for gross
lack of finesse. But then, neither she nor Bancroft had been looking into Victor
Elliott's face the night he told me about his family. I swallowed a sharp retort and
marshalled what I knew, trying to decide how much to let go of.
'Laurens?'
Miriam Bancroft was standing just outside the conservatory, a towel draped
around her neck and her racket under one arm.
'Miriam.' There was a genuine deference in Bancroft's tone, but little else that I
could determine.
'I'm taking Nalan and Joseph out to Hudson's Raft for a scuba lunch. Joseph's
never done it before, and we've talked him into it.' She glanced from Bancroft to
myself and back. 'Will you be coming with us?'

'Maybe later,' said Bancroft. 'Where will you be?'
Miriam shrugged. 'I hadn't really thought about it. Somewhere on the starboard
decks. Benton's, maybe?'
'Fine. I'll catch you up. Spear me a kingfish if you see one.'
'Aye aye.' She touched the blade of one hand to the side of her head in a
ludicrous salute that made both of us smile unexpectedly. Miriam's gaze
quivered and settled on me. 'Do you like seafood, Mr Kovacs?'
'Probably. I've had very little time to exercise my tastes on Earth, Mrs Bancroft.
So far I've only eaten what my hotel has to offer.'
'Well. Once you've developed a taste for it,' she said significantly, 'maybe we'll
see you as well?'
'Thank you, but I doubt it.'
'Well,' she repeated brightly. 'Try not to be too much longer, Laurens. I'll need
some help keeping Marco off Nalan's back. He's fuming, by the way.'
Bancroft grunted. 'The way he played today, I'm not surprised. I thought for a
while he was doing it deliberately.'
'Not the last game,' I said, to no one in particular.
The Bancrofts focused on me, he unreadably, she with her head tipped to one
side and a sudden wide smile that made her look unexpectedly child-like. For a
moment I met her gaze, and one hand rose to touch her hair with what seemed
like fractional uncertainty.
'Curtis will be bringing the limousine round,' she said. 'I'll have to go. It was a
pleasure to see you again, Mr Kovacs.'
We both watched her stride away across the lawn, her tennis skirt tilting back
and forth. Even allowing for Bancroft's apparent indifference to his wife as a
sexual being, Miriam's wordplay was steering fractionally too close to the wind
for my liking. I had to plug the silence with something.

'Tell me something, Bancroft,' I said with my eyes still on the receding figure.
'No disrespect intended, but why does someone who's married to her, who's
chosen to stay married, spend his time in quote purchased sexual release?'
I turned casually back and found him watching me without expression. He said
nothing for several seconds, and when he spoke his voice was carefully bland.
'Have you ever come in a woman's face, Kovacs?'
Culture shock is something they teach you to lock down very early on in the
Corps, but just occasionally a blast gets through the armour and the reality
around you feels like a jigsaw that won't quite fit together. I barely chopped off
my stare before it got started. This man, older than the entire human history of
my planet, was asking me this question. It was as if he'd asked me had I ever
played with water pistols.
'Uh. Yes. It, uh, it happens if — '
'A woman you paid?'
'Well, sometimes. Not especially. I — ' I remembered his wife's abandoned
laughter as I exploded into and around her mouth, come trickling down over her
knuckles like foam from a popped champagne bottle. 'I don't really remember.
It's not a special fetish of mine, and —
'Nor of mine,' snapped the man in front of me, with rather too much emphasis. 'I
choose it merely as an example. There are things, desires, in all of us that are
better suppressed. Or at least, that cannot be expressed in a civilised context.'
'I'd hardly counterpose civilisation with spilling semen.'
'You come from another place,' said Bancroft broodingly. 'A brash, young
colonial culture. You can have no concept of how the centuries of tradition have
moulded us here on earth. The young of spirit, the adventurous, all left on the
ships in droves. They were encouraged to leave. Those who stayed were the
stolid, the obedient, the limited. I watched it happen, and at the time I was glad,
because it made carving out an empire so much easier. Now, I wonder if it was
worth the price we paid. Culture fell in on itself, grappled after norms to live by,
settled for the old and familiar. Rigid morality, rigid law. The UN declarations
fossilised into global conformity, there was a — ' he gestured ' — a sort of

supracultural straitjacket, and with an inherent fear of what might be borne from
the colonies, the Protectorate arose while the ships were still in flight. When the
first of them made planetfall, their stored peoples woke into a prepared tyranny.'
'You talk as if you stood outside it. With this much vision, you still can't fight
your way free?'
Bancroft smiled thinly. 'Culture is like a smog. To live within it, you must
breathe some of it in and, inevitably, be contaminated. And in any case, what
does free mean in this context? Free to spill semen on my wife's face and
breasts? Free to have her masturbate in front of me, to share the use of her flesh
with other men and women. Two hundred and fifty years is a long time, Mr
Kovacs, time enough for a very long list of dirty, degrading fantasies to infest the
mind and titillate the hormones of each fresh sleeve you wear. While all the time
your finer feelings grow purer and more rarified. Do you have any concept of
what happens to emotional bonds over such a period?'
I opened my mouth, but he held up his hand for silence and I let him have it. It's
not every day you get to hear the outpourings of a centuries-old soul and
Bancroft was in full flow.
'No,' he answered his own question. 'How could you? Just as your culture is too
shallow to appreciate what it is to live on Earth, your life experience cannot
possibly encompass what it is to love the same person for two hundred and fifty
years. In the end, if you endure, if you beat the traps of boredom and
complacency, in the end what you are left with is not love. It is almost
veneration. How then to match that respect, that veneration with the sordid
desires of whatever flesh you are wearing at the time? I tell you, you cannot.'
'So instead you vent yourself on prostitutes?'
The thin smile returned. 'I am not proud of myself, Mr Kovacs. But you do not
live this long without accepting yourself in every facet, however distasteful. The
women are there. They satisfy a market need, and are recompensed accordingly.
And in this way I purge myself.'
'Does your wife know this?'
'Of course. And has done for a very considerable time. Oumou informs me that
you are already aware of the facts regarding Leila Begin. Miriam has calmed

down a lot since then. I'm sure she has adventures of her own.'
'How sure?'
Bancroft made an irritated gesture. 'Is this relevant? I don't have my wife
monitored, if that's what you mean, but I know her. She has her appetites to
contend with just as I do.'
'And this doesn't bother you?'
'Mr Kovacs, I am many things, but I am not a hypocrite. It is the flesh, nothing
more. Miriam and I understand this. And now, since this line of questioning
doesn't seem to be leading anywhere, can we please get back on track. In the
absence of any guilt on the part of Elliott, what else do you have?'
I made a decision then that came up from levels of instinct way below conscious
thought. I shook my head. 'There's nothing yet.'
'But there will be?'
'Yes. You can write Ortega off to this sleeve, but there's still Kadmin. He wasn't
after Ryker. He knew me. Something's going on.'
Bancroft: nodded in satisfaction. 'Are you going to speak to Kadmin?'
'If Ortega lets me.'
'Meaning?'
'Meaning the police will have run whatever satellite footage they've got over
Oakland this morning, which means they can probably identify me leaving the
clinic. There must have been something overhead at the time. I don't suppose
they'll be at: their most co-operative.'
Bancroft permitted himself another of his splintered smiles. 'Very astute, Mr
Kovacs. But you need have nothing to fear on that count. The Wei Clinic —
what little you left of it — is reluctant to either release internal video footage or
press charges against anyone. They have more to fear in any investigation than
do you. Of course, whether they choose to seek more private reprisals is, shall
we say, a more protracted question.'

'And Jerry's?'
A shrug. 'The same. With the proprietor dead, a managing interest has stepped
in.'
'Very tidy.'
'I'm glad you appreciate it.' Bancroft got to his feet. 'As I said, it has been a busy
morning, and negotiations are by no means at an end. I would be grateful if you
could limit your depredations somewhat in future. It has been costly.'
Getting to my feet, just for a moment I had the traceries of fire at Innenin across
the back of my vision, the screaming deaths heard at a level that was bone deep,
and suddenly Bancroft's elegant understatement rang sickly and grotesque, like
the antiseptic words of General MacIntyre's damage reports . . . for securing the
Innenin beachhead, a price well worth paying . . . Like Bancroft, MacIntyre had
been a man of power, and like all men of power, when he talked of prices worth
paying, you could be sure of one thing.
Someone else was paying.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

The Fell Street station was an unassuming block done out in a style I assumed
must be Martian Baroque. Whether it had been planned that way, as a police
station, or taken over after the fact was difficult to decide. The place was,
potentially, a fortress. The mock-eroded rubystone facings and hooded buttresses
provided a series of natural niches in which were set high, stained glass windows
edged by the unobtrusive nubs of shield generators. Below the windows, the
abrasive red surface of the stonework was sculpted into jagged obstructions that:
caught the morning light and turned it bloody. I couldn't tell whether the steps up
to the arched entrance were deliberately uneven or just well worn.
Inside, stained light from a window and a peculiar calm fell on me
simultaneously. Subsonics, I guessed, casting a glance around at the human
flotsam waiting submissively on the benches. If these were arrested suspects,
they had been rendered remarkably unconcerned by something and I doubted it
would be the Zen Populist murals that someone had commissioned for the hall. I
crossed the patch of coloured light cast by the window, picked my way through
small knots of people conversing in lowered tones more appropriate to a library
than a holding centre, and found myself at a reception counter. A uniformed cop,
presumably the desk sergeant, blinked kindly back at me — the subsonics were
obviously getting to him as well.
'Lieutenant Ortega,' I told him. 'Organic Damage.'

'Who shall I say it is?'
'Tell her it's Elias Ryker.'
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw another uniform turn at the sound of the
name, but nothing was said. The desk sergeant spoke into his phone, listened
then turned back to me.
'She's sending someone down. Are you armed?'
I nodded and reached under my jacket for the Nemex.
'Please surrender the weapon carefully,' he added with a gentle smile. 'Our
security software is a little touchy, and it's apt to stun you if you look like you're
pulling something.'
I slowed my movements to frame advance, dumped the Nemex on the desk and
set about unstrapping the Tebbit knife from my arm. When I was finished, the
sergeant beamed beatifically at me.
'Thank you. It'll all be returned to you when you leave the building.'
The words were barely out of his mouth when two of the mohicans appeared
through a door at the back of the hall and directed themselves rapidly towards
me. Their faces were painted with identical glowers which the subsonics
apparently made little impact on in the short time it took them to reach me. They
went for an arm apiece.
'I wouldn't,' I told them.
'Hey, he's not under arrest, you know,' said the desk sergeant pacifically. One of
the mohicans jerked a glance at him and snorted in exasperation. The other one
just stared at me the whole time as if he hadn't eaten red meat recently. I met the
stare with a smile. Following the meeting with Bancroft I had gone back to the
Hendrix and slept for almost twenty hours. I was rested, neurachemically alert
and feeling a cordial dislike of authority of which Quell herself would have been
proud.
It must have shown. The mohicans abandoned their attempts to paw me and the
three of us rode up four floors in silence broken only by the creak of the ancient

elevator.
Ortega's office had one of the stained glass windows, or more precisely the
bottom half of one, before it was bisected horizontally by the ceiling.
Presumably the remainder rose missile-like from the floor of the office above. I
began to see some evidence for the original building having been converted to its
present use. The other walls of the office were environment-formatted with a
tropical sunset over water and islands. The combination of stained glass and
sunset meant that the office was filled with a soft orange light in which you
could see the drifting of dust motes.
The lieutenant was seated behind a heavy wooden desk as if caged there. Chin
propped on one cupped hand, one shin and knee pressed hard against the edge of
the desk, she was brooding over the scrolldown of an antique laptop when we
came through the door. Aside from the machine, the only items on the desktop
were a battered-looking heavy-calibre Smith & Wesson and a plastic cup of
coffee, heating tab still unpulled. She dismissed the mohicans with a nod.
'Sit down, Kovacs.'
I glanced around, saw a frame chair under the window and hooked it up to the
desk. The late afternoon light in the office was disorientating.
'You work the night shift?'
Her eyes flared. 'What kind of crack is that?'
'Hey, nothing.' I held up my hands and gestured at the low light. 'I just thought
you might have cycled the walls for it. You know it's ten o'clock in the morning
outside.'
'Oh, that.' Ortega grunted and her eyes swivelled back down to the screen
display. It was hard to tell in the tropical sunset, but I thought they might be
grey/green, like the sea around the maelstrom. 'It's out of synch. The department
got it cheap from some place in El Paso Juarez. Jams up completely sometimes.'
'That's tough.'
'Yeah, sometimes I'll just turn it off but the neons are — She looked up abruptly.
'What the fuck am I — Kovacs, do you know how close you are to a storage rack

right now?'
I made a span of my right index finger and thumb, and looked at her through it.
'About the width of a testimony from the Wei Clinic, was what I heard.'
'We can put you there, Kovacs. Seven forty-three yesterday morning, walking
out the front door larger than life.'
I shrugged.
'And don't think your Meth connections are going to keep you organic forever.
There's a Wei Clinic limo driver telling interesting stories about hijack and Real
Death. Maybe he'll have something to say about you.'
'Impound his vehicle did you?' I asked casually. 'Or did Wei reclaim it before
you could run tests?'
Ortega's mouth compressed into a hard line.
I nodded. 'Thought so. And the driver will say precisely zero until Wei spring
him, I imagine.'
'Listen, Kovacs. I keep pushing, something's got to give. It's a matter of time,
motherfucker. Strictly that.'
'Admirable tenacity,' I said. 'Shame you didn't have some of that for the Bancroft
case.'
'There is no fucking Bancroft case.'
Ortega was on her feet, palms hard down on the desktop, eyes slitted in rage and
disgust. I waited, nerves sprung in case Bay City police stations were as prone to
accidental suspect injury as some others I had known. Finally, the lieutenant
drew a deep breath, and lowered herself joint by joint back into her seat. The
anger had smoothed off her face, but the disgust was still there, caught in the fine
lines at the corners of her eyes and the set of her wide mouth. She looked at her
nails.
'Do you know what we found at the Wei Clinic yesterday?'

'Black market spare parts? Virtual torture programmes? Or didn't they let you
stay that long?'
'We found seventeen bodies with their cortical stacks burnt out. Unarmed.
Seventeen dead people. Really dead.'
She looked up at me again, the disgust still there.
'You'll have to pardon my lack of reaction,' I said coldly. 'I saw a lot worse when
I was in uniform. In fact, I did a lot worse when I was righting the Protectorate's
battles for them.'
'That was war.'
'Oh, please.'
She said nothing. I leaned forward across the desk.
'And don't tell me those seventeen bodies are what you're on fire about, either.' I
gestured at my own face. 'This is your problem. You don't like the idea of
someone carving this up.'
She sat silent for a moment, thinking, then reached into a drawer of the desk and
took out a packet of cigarettes. She offered them to me automatically and I shook
my head with clenched determination.
'I quit.'
'Did you?' There was genuine surprise in her voice, as she fed herself a cigarette
and lit it. 'Good for you. I'm impressed.'
'Yeah, Ryker should be pleased too, when he gets off stack.'
She paused behind the veil of smoke, then dropped the packet back into the
drawer and palm-heeled it shut.
'What do you want?' she asked flatly.

The holding racks were five floors down in a double-storey basement where it

was easier to regulate temperatures. Compared to PsychaSec, it was a toilet.
'I don't see that this is going to change anything,' said Ortega as we followed a
yawning technician along the steel gantry to slot 3089b. 'What's Kadmin going
to tell you that he hasn't told us?'
'Look.' I stopped arid turned to face her, hands spread and held low. On the
narrow gantry we were uncomfortably close. Something chemical happened, and
the geometries of Ortega's stance seemed suddenly fluid, dangerously tactile. I
felt my mouth dry up.
'I — ' she said.
'3089b,' called the technician, hefting the big, thirty-centimetre disc out of its
slot. 'This the one you wanted, lieutenant?'
Ortega pushed hurriedly past me. 'That's it, Micky. Can you set us up with a
virtual.'
'Sure.' Micky jerked a thumb at one of the spiral staircases collared in at intervals
along the gantry. 'You want to go down to Five, slap on the trodes. Take about
five minutes.'
'The point is,' I said, as the three of us clattered down the steel steps, 'you're the
Sia. Kadmin knows you, he's been dealing with you all his professional life. It's
part of what he does. I'm an unknown. If he's never been extra-system, the
chances are he's never met an Envoy before. And they tell nasty stories about the
Corps most places I've been.'
Ortega gave me a sceptical look over her shoulder. 'You're going to frighten him
into a statement? Dimitri Kadmin? I don't think so.'
'He'll be off balance, and when people are off balance they give things away.
Don't forget, this guy's working for someone who wants me dead. Someone who
is scared of me, at least superficially. Some of that may rub off on Kadmin.'
'And this is supposed to convince me that someone murdered Bancroft after all?'
'Ortega, it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not. We've been through this
already. You want Ryker's sleeve back in the tank asap, out of harm's way. The

sooner we get to whatever bottom there is to Bancroft's death, the sooner that
happens. And I'm a lot less likely to incur substantial organic damage if I'm not
stumbling around in the dark. If I have your help, in fact. You don't want this
sleeve to get written off in another firefight, do you?'
'Another firefight?' It had taken nearly half an hour of heated discussion to
hammer the sense of the new relationship into Ortega, and the policewoman in
her still hadn't gone to sleep on me.
'Yeah, after the Hendrix,' I improvised rapidly, cursing the face-to-face chemical
interlock that had put: me off balance. 'I picked up some bad bruising there.
Could have been a lot worse.'
She shot me another, longer glance over her shoulder.
The virtual interrogation system was housed in a series of bubblefab cabins at
one side of the basement floor. Micky settled both of us onto weary-looking
automould couches that were slow to respond to our forms, applied the
electrodes and hypnophones, then kicked in the power with a concert pianist's
sweep of one arm across two of the utilitarian consoles. He studied the screens
as they blinked on.
'Traffic,' he said, and hawked congestion into the back of his throat with disgust.
'Commissioner's hooked in with some kind of conference environment and it's
soaking up half the system. Got to wait till someone else gets off.' He glanced
back at Ortega. 'Hey, that the Mary Lou Hinchley thing?'
'Yeah.' Ortega looked across to include me in the conversation, maybe as
evidence of our new co-operation. 'Last year the Coastals fished some kid out of
the ocean. Mary Lou Hinchley. Not much left of the body, but they got the stack.
Set it to spin and guess what?'
'Catholic?'
'In one. That Total Absorb stuff works, huh? Yeah, the first entry scan comes up
with Barred by Reasons of Conscience decals. Usually the end of the line in a
case like that, but El — ' She stopped. Restarted. 'The detective in charge
wouldn't let it go. Hinchley was from his neighbourhood, he knew her when she
was growing up. Not well, but — ' she shrugged ' — he wouldn't let: it go.'

'Very tenacious. Elias Ryker?'
She nodded.
'He pushed the path labs for a month. In the end they found some evidence the
body had been thrown out of an aircar. Organic Damage did some background
digging and came up with a conversion less than ten months old and a hardline
Catholic boyfriend with skills in infotech who might have faked the Vow. The
girl's family are border-liners, nominally Christian, but mostly not Catholic.
Quite rich as well, with a vault full of stacked ancestors that they spin out for
family births and marriages. The Department's been in virtual consultation with
the lot of them on and off all of this year.'
'Roll on Resolution 653, huh?'
'Yeah.'
We both went back to looking at the ceiling above the couches. The cabin was
bottom of the line bubblefab, blown from a single globe of polyfibre like chicle
in a child's mouth, doors and windows lasered out and re-attached with epoxy
hinges afterwards. The curved grey ceiling held absolutely nothing of interest.
'Tell me something, Ortega,' I said after a while. 'That tail you had on me
Tuesday afternoon, when I went shopping. How come he was so much worse
than the others? A blind man could have spotted him.'
There was a pause before she spoke. Then, grudgingly. 'All we had. It was a snap
thing, we had to get you covered quick, after you dumped the clothes.'
'The clothes.' I closed my eyes. 'Oh, no. You tagged the suit? That simple?'
'Yep.'
I threw my mind back to my first meeting with Ortega. The justice facility, the
ride out to Suntouch House. The total recall ripped through the footage on fast
forward. I saw us standing on the sunlit lawn with Miriam Bancroft. Ortega
departing . . .
'Got it!' I snapped my fingers. 'You hammered me on the shoulder when you left.
I can't believe I'm this stupid.'

'Enzyme bond bleeper,' said Ortega matter of factly. 'Not much bigger than a
fly's eye. And we figured, with autumn well set in you wouldn't be going many
places without your jacket. Course, when you offloaded it into that skip we
thought you'd tipped us.'
'No. Nothing so bright,'
'That's it,' announced Micky suddenly. 'Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your
spinal spiral, we are in the pipe.'
It was a rougher ride than I'd expected from a government department
installation, but no worse than many jury-rigged virtuals I'd done on the World.
First the hypnos, pulsing their sonocodes until the dull grey ceiling grew
abruptly fascinating with fishtail swirls of light and meaning drained out of the
universe like dirty water from a sink. And then I was
Elsewhere.
It spread out around me, racing away from my viewpoint in all directions like
nothing so much as a huge magnification of one of the spiral steps we had used
to get down from the gantry. Steel grey, stippled every few metres with a nipplelike swelling, receding to infinity. The sky above was a paler shade of the same
grey with shiftings that seemed vaguely to suggest bars and antique locks. Nice
psychology, assuming any of the felons interrogated had anything but race
memory of what an actual lock looked like.
In front of me softly shaped grey furniture was evolving from the floor like a
sculpture from a pool of mercury. A plain metal table first, then two chairs this
side, one opposite. Their edges and surfaces ran liquidly smooth for the final
seconds of their emergence, then snapped solid arid geometric as they took on an
existence separate to the floor.
Ortega appeared beside me, at first a pale pencil sketch of a woman, all
flickering lines and diffident shading. As I watched, pastel colours raced through
her and her movements grew more defined. She was turning to speak to me, one
hand reaching into the pocket of her jacket. I waited and the final gloss of colour
popped out onto her surfaces. She produced her cigarettes.
'Smoke?'

'No thanks, I — ' Realising the futility of worrying about virtual health, I
accepted the packet and shook one out. Ortega lit us both with her petrol lighter,
and the first bite of smoke in my lungs was ecstasy.
I looked up at the geometric sky. 'Is this standard?'
'Pretty much.' Ortega squinted into the distance. 'Resolution looks a bit higher
than usual. Think Micky's showing off.'
Kadmin scribbled into existence on the other side of the table. Before the virtual
program had even coloured him in properly, he became aware of us and folded
his arms across his chest. If my appearance in the cell was putting him off
balance as hoped, it didn't show.
'Again, lieutenant?' he said when the programme had rendered him complete.
'There is a UN ruling on maximum virtual time for one arrest, you know.'
'That's right, and we're still a long way off it,' said Ortega. 'Why don't you sit
down, Kadmin.'
'No thank you.'
'I said sit, motherfucker.' There was an abrupt undercurrent of steel in the cop's
voice, and magically Kadmin blinked off and reappeared seated at the table. His
face betrayed a momentary flash of rage at the displacement, but then it was
gone and he unfolded his arms in an ironic gesture.
'You're right, it's so much more comfortable like this. Won't you both join me?'
We took our seats in the more conventional way, and I stared at Kadmin as we
did it. It was the first time I'd seen anything quite like it.
He was the Patchwork Man.
Most virtual systems recreate you from self images held in the memory, with a
common-sense sub-routine to prevent your delusions from impinging too much.
I generally come out a little taller and thinner in the face than I usually am. In
this case, the system seemed to have scrambled a myriad different perceptions
from Kadmin's presumably long list of sleeves. I'd seen it done before, as a
technique, but most of us grow rapidly attached to whatever sleeve we're living

in, and that form blanks out previous incarnations. We are, after all, evolved to
relate to the physical world.
The man in front of me was different. His frame was that of a Caucasian Nordic,
topping mine by nearly thirty centimetres, but the face was at odds. It began
African, broad and deep ebony, but the colour ended like a mask under the eyes
and the lower half was divided along the line of the nose, pale copper on the left,
corpse white on the right. The nose was both fleshy and aquiline and mediated
well between the top and bottom halves of the face, but the mouth was a
mismatch of left and right sides that left the lips peculiarly twisted. Long straight
black hair was combed mane-like back from the forehead, shot through on one
side with pure white. The hands, immobile on the metal table, were equipped
with claws similar to the ones I'd seen on the giant freak fighter in Licktown, hut
the fingers were long and sensitive. He had breasts, impossibly full on a torso so
overmuscled. The eyes, set in jet skin, were a startling pale green. Kadmin had
freed himself from conventional perceptions of the physical. In an earlier age, he
would have been a shaman; here, the centuries of technology had made him
more. An electronic demon, a malignant spirit that dwelled in altered carbon and
emerged only to possess flesh and wreak havoc.
He would have made a fine Envoy.
'I take it I don't have to introduce myself,' I said quietly.
Kadmin grinned, revealing small teeth and a delicate pointed tongue. 'If you're a
friend of the lieutenant, you don't have to do anything you don't want to here.
Only the slobs get their virtuality edited.'
'Do you know this man, Kadmin?' asked Ortega.
'Hoping for a confession, lieutenant?' Kadmin threw back his head and laughed
musically. 'Oh, the crudity! This man? This woman, maybe? Or, yes, even a dog
could be trained to say as much as he has said, given the right tranquillisers of
course. They do tend to go pitifully insane when you decant them if not. But yes,
even a dog. We sit here, three silhouettes carved from electronic sleet in the
difference storm, and you talk like a cheap period drama. Limited vision,
lieutenant, limited vision. Where is the voice that said altered carbon would free
us from the cells of our flesh? The vision that said we would be angels.'
'You tell me, Kadmin. You're the one with the exalted professional standing.'

Ortega's tone was detached. She system-magicked a long scroll of printout into
one hand and glanced idly down it. 'Pimp, triad enforcer, virtual interrogator in
the corporate wars, it's all quality work. Me, I'm just some dumb cop can't see
the light.'
'I'm not going to quarrel with you there, lieutenant.'
'Says here you were a wiper for MeritCon a while back, scaring archaeologue
miners off their claims in Syrtis Major. Slaughtering their families by way of
incentive. Nice job.' Ortega tossed the printout back into oblivion. 'We've got
you cold, Kadmin. Digital footage from the hotel surveillance system, verifiable
simultaneous sleeving, both stacks on ice. That's an erasure mandatory, and even
if your lawyers dance it down to Compliance at Machine Error, the sun's going
to be a red dwarf by the time they let you off stack.'
Kadmin smiled. 'Then what are you here for?'
'Who sent you?' I asked him softly.
'The Dog speaks!
Is it a wolf I hear,
Howling his lonely communion
With the unpiloted stars,
Or merely the self importance and servitude
In the bark of a dog?

How many millennia did it take,
Twisting and torturing
The pride from the one
To make a tool,

The other?'

I inhaled smoke and nodded. Like most Harlanites, I had Quell's Poems and
Other Prevarications more or less by heart. It was taught in schools in lieu of the
later and weightier political works, most of which were still deemed too radical
to be put in the hands of children. This wasn't a great translation, but it captured
the essence. More impressive was the fact that anyone not actually from Harlan's
World could quote such an obscure volume.
I finished it for him.

'And how do we measure the distance from spirit to
spirit?
And who do we find to blame?'

'Have you come seeking blame, Mr Kovacs?'
'Among other things.'
'How disappointing.'
'You expected something else?'
'No,' said Kadmin with another smile. 'Expectation is our first mistake. I meant,
how disappointing for you.'
'Maybe.'
He shook his great piebald head. 'Certainly. You will take no names from me. If
you seek blame, I will have to bear it for you.'
'That's very generous, but you'll remember what Quell said about lackeys.'

'Kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy
targets.' Kadmin chuckled deep inside himself. 'Are you threatening me in
monitored police storage?'
'No. I'm just putting things into perspective.' I knocked ash off my cigarette and
watched it sparkle out of existence before it reached the floor. 'Someone's pulling
your strings; that's who I'm going to wipe. You're nothing. You I wouldn't waste
spit on.'
Kadmin tipped his head back as a stronger tremor ran through the shifting lines
in the sky, like Cubist lightning. It reflected in the dull sheen on the metal table
and seemed to touch his hands for a moment. When he looked down at me again,
it was with a curious light in his eyes.
'I was not asked to kill you,' he said tonelessly, 'unless your abduction proved
inconvenient. But now I will.'
Ortega was on him as the last syllable left his mouth. The table blinked out of
existence and she kicked him backwards off the chair with one booted foot. As
he rolled back to his feet, the same boot caught him in the mouth and floored
him again. I ran my tongue round the almost healed gashes inside my own
mouth, and felt a distinct lack of sympathy.
Ortega dragged Kadmin up by the hair, the cigarette in her hand replaced by a
vicious-looking blackjack courtesy of the same system magic that had eliminated
the table.
'I hear you right?' she hissed. 'You making threats, rackhead?'
Kadmin bared his teeth in a bloodstained grin.
'Police brutal — '
'That's right, motherfucker.' Ortega hit him across the cheek with the blackjack.
The skin split. 'Police brutality in a monitored police virtuality. Sandy Kim and
WorldWeb One would have a field day, wouldn't they? But you know what? I
reckon your lawyers aren't going to want to run this particular tape.'
'Leave him alone, Ortega.'

She seemed to remember herself then, and stepped back.
Her face twitched and she drew a deep breath. The table blinked back and
Kadmin was suddenly sitting upright again, mouth undamaged.
'You too,' he said quietly.
'Yeah, sure.' There was contempt in Ortega's voice, at least half of it directed at
herself I guessed. She made a second effort to bring her breathing back under
control, rearranged her clothing unnecessarily. 'Like I said, going to be a cold
day in hell by the time you get the chance. Maybe I'll wait for you.'
'Whoever sent you worth this much, Kadmin?' I wondered softly. 'You going
down silent out: of contractual loyalty, or are you just scared shitless?'
For answer, the composite man folded his arms across his chest and stared
through me.
'You through, Kovacs?' asked Ortega.
I tried to meet Kadmin's distant gaze. 'Kadmin, the man I work for has a lot of
influence. This could be your last chance to cut a deal.'
Nothing. He didn't even blink.
I shrugged. 'I'm through.'
'Good,' said Ortega grimly. 'Because sitting downwind of this piece of shit is
beginning to eat away at my usually tolerant nature.' She waggled her fingers in
front of his eyes. 'Be seeing you, fuckhead.'
At that, Kadmin's eyes turned up to meet hers, and a small, peculiarly unpleasant
smile twisted his lips.
We left.

Back on the fourth floor, the walls of Ortega's office had reverted to a dazzling
high noon over beaches of white sand. I screwed up my eyes against the glare

while Ortega trawled through a desk drawer and came up with her own and a
spare pair of sunglasses.
'So what did you learn from that?'
I fitted the lenses uncomfortably over the bridge of my nose. They were too
small. 'Not much, except that little gem about not having orders to wipe me.
Someone wanted to talk to me. I'd pretty much guessed that anyway, else he
could have just blown my stack out all over the lobby of the Hendrix. Still,
means someone wanted to cut a deal of their own, outside of Bancroft.'
'Or someone wanted to interrogate the guts out of you.'
I shook my head. 'About what? I'd only just arrived. Doesn't make any sense.'
'The Corps? Unfinished business?' Ortega made little flicking motions with her
hand as if she were dealing me the suggestions. 'Maybe a grudge match?'
'No. We went through this one when we were yelling at each other the other
night. There are people who'd like to see me wiped, but none of them live on
Earth, and none of them swing the kind of influence to go interstellar. And
there's nothing I know about the Corps that isn't in a low-wall datastack
somewhere. And anyway, it's just too much of a fucking coincidence. No, this is
about Bancroft. Someone wanted in on the program.'
'Whoever had him killed?'
I tipped my head down to look at her directly over the sun lenses. 'You believe
me, then.'
'Not entirely.'
'Oh, come on.'
But Ortega wasn't listening. 'What I want to know,' she brooded, 'is why he
rewrote his codes at the end. You know, we've sweated him nearly a dozen times
since we downloaded him Sunday night. That's the first time he's come close to
even admitting he was there.'
'Even to his lawyers?'

'We don't know what he says to them. They're big-time sharks, out of Ulan Bator
and New York. That kind of money carries a scrambler into all privy virtual
interviews. We get nothing on tape but static.'
I raised a mental eyebrow. On Harlan's World, all virtual custody was monitored
as a matter of course. Scramblers were not permitted, no matter how much
money you were worth.
'Speaking of lawyers, are Kadmin's here in Bay City?'
'Physically, you mean? Yeah, they've got a deal with a Marin County practice.
One of their partners is renting a sleeve here for the duration.' Ortega's lip curled.
'Physical meetings are considered a touch of class these days. Only the cheap
firms do business down the wires.'
'What's this suit's name?'
There was a brief pause while she hung onto the name. 'Kadmin's a spinning
item right now. I'm not sure we go this far.'
'Ortega, we go all the way. That was the deal. Otherwise I'm back to risking
Elias's fine features with some more maximal push investigation.'
She was silent for a while.
'Rutherford,' she said finally. 'You want to talk to Rutherford?'
'Right now, I want to talk to anyone. Maybe I didn't make things clear earlier. I'm
working cold here. Bancroft waited a month and a half before he brought me in.
Kadmin's all I've got.'
'Keith Rutherford's a handful of engine grease. You won't get any more out of
him than you did Kadmin downstairs. And anyway, how the fuck am I supposed
to introduce you, Kovacs? Hi, Keith, this is the ex-Envoy loose cannon your
client tried to wipe on Sunday. He'd like to ask you a few questions. He'll close
up faster than an unpaid hooker's hole.'
She had a point. I thought about it for a moment, staring out to sea.
'All right,' I said slowly. 'All I need is a couple of minutes' conversation. How

about you tell him I'm Elias Ryker, your partner from Organic Damage? I
practically am, after all.'
Ortega took off her lenses and stared at me.
'Are you trying to be funny?'
'No. I'm trying to be practical. Rutherford's sleeving in from Ulan Bator, right?'
'New York,' she said tightly.
'New York. Right. So he probably doesn't know anything about you or Ryker.'
'Probably not.'
'So what's the problem?'
'The problem is, Kovacs, that I don't like it.'
There was more silence. I dropped my gaze into my lap and let out a sigh that
was only partially manufactured. Then I took off my own sunglasses and looked
up at her. It was all there on plain display. The naked fear of sleeving and all that
it entailed; paranoid essentialism with its back to the wall.
'Ortega,' I said gently. 'I'm not him. I'm not trying to be hi — '
'You couldn't even come close,' she snapped.
'All we're talking about is a couple of hours' make-believe.'
'Is that all?'
She said it in a voice like iron, and she put her sunglasses back on with such
brusque efficiency that I didn't need to see the tears welling up in the eyes
behind the mirror lenses.
'All right,' she said finally, clearing her throat. 'I'll get you in. I don't see the
point, but I'll do it. Then what?'
'That's a little difficult to say. I'll have to improvise.'

'Like you did at the Wei Clinic?'
I shrugged noncommittally. 'Envoy techniques are largely reactive. I can't react
to something until it happens.'
'I don't want another bloodbath, Kovacs. It looks bad on the city stats.'
'If there's violence, it won't be me that starts it.'
'That's not much of a guarantee. Haven't you got any idea what you're going to
do?'
'I'm going to talk.'
'Just talk?' She looked at me disbelievingly. 'That's all?' I jammed my ill-fitting
sunglasses back on my face. 'Sometimes that's all it takes.' I said.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

I met my first lawyer when I was fifteen. He was a harried-looking juvenile
affray expert who defended me, not unhandily, in a minor organic damage suit
involving a Newpest police officer. He bargained them down with a kind of
myopic patience to Conditional Release and eleven minutes of virtual psychiatric
counselling. In the hall outside the juvenile court, he looked into my probably
infuriatingly smug face and nodded as if his worst fears about the meaning of his
life were being confirmed. Then he turned on his heel and walked away. I forget
his name.
My entry into the Newpest gang scene shortly afterwards precluded any more
such legal encounters. The gangs were web-smart, wired up and already writing
their own intrusion programmes or buying them from kids half their age in
return for low-grade virtual porn ripped off the networks. They didn't get caught
easily, and in return for this favour the Newpest heat tended to leave them alone.
Inter-gang violence was largely ritualised and excluded other players most of the
time. On the odd occasion that it spilled over and affected civilians, there would
be a rapid and brutal series of punitive raids that left a couple of lead gang
heroes in the store and the rest of us with extensive bruising. Fortunately I never
worked my way up the chain of command far enough to get put away, so the
next time I saw the inside of a courtroom was the Innenin inquiry.
The lawyers I saw there had about as much in common with the man who had
defended me at fifteen as automated machine rifle fire has with farting. They

were cold, professionally polished arid well on their way up a career ladder
which would ensure that despite the uniforms they wore, they would never have
to come within a thousand kilometres of a genuine firefight. The only problem
they had, as they cruised sharkishly back and forth across the cool marble floor
of the court, was in drawing the fine differences between war (mass murder of
people wearing a uniform not your own), justifiable loss (mass murder of your
own troops, but with substantial gains) and criminal negligence (mass murder of
your own troops, without appreciable benefit). I sat in that courtroom for three
weeks listening to them dress it like a variety of salads, and with every passing
hour the distinctions, which at one point I'd been pretty clear on, grew
increasingly vague. I suppose that proves how good they were.
After that, straightforward criminality came as something of a relief.
'Something bothering you?' Ortega glanced sideways at me as she brought the
unmarked cruiser down on a shelving pebble beach below the split-level, glassfronted offices of Prendergast Sanchez, attorneys-at-law.
'Just thinking.'
'Try cold showers and alcohol. Works for me.'
I nodded and held up the minuscule bead of metal I had been rolling between my
finger and thumb. 'Is this legal?'
Ortega reached up and killed the primaries. 'More or less. No one's going to
complain.'
'Good. Now, I'm going to need verbal cover to start with. You do the talking, I'll
just shut up and listen. Take it from there.'
'Fine. Ryker was like that, anyway. Never used two words if one would do it.
Most of the time with the scumbags, he'd just look at them.'
'Sort of Micky Nozawa-type, huh?'
'Who?'
'Never mind.' The rattle of upthrown pebbles on the hull died away as Ortega cut
the engines to idle. I stretched in my seat and threw open my side of the hatch.

Climbing out, I saw an over-burly figure coming down the meandering set of
wooden steps from the split level. Looked like grafting. A blunt-looking gun was
slung over his shoulder and he wore gloves. Probably not a lawyer.
'Go easy,' said Ortega, suddenly at my shoulder. 'We have jurisdiction here. He
isn't going to start anything.'
She flashed her badge as the muscle jumped the last step to the beach and landed
on flexed legs. You could see the disappointment on his face as he saw it.
'Bay City police. We're here to see Rutherford.'
'You can't park that here.'
'I already have,' Ortega told him evenly. 'Arc we going to keep Mr Rutherford
waiting?'
There was a prickly silence, but she'd gauged him correctly. Contenting himself
with a grunt, the muscle gestured us up the staircase and followed at prudent
shepherding distance. It took a while to get to the top, and I was pleased to see
when we arrived that Ortega was considerably more out of breath than I was. We
went across a modest sundeck made from the same wood as the stairs and
through two sets of automatic plate glass doors into a reception area styled to
look like someone's lounge. There were rugs on the floor, knitted in the same
patterns as my jacket, and Empathist prints on the walls. Five single armchairs
provided parking.
'Can I help you?'
This was a lawyer, no question about it. A smoothly groomed blonde woman in a
loose skirt and jacket tailored to fit the room, hands resting comfortably in her
pockets.
'Bay City police. Where's Rutherford?'
The woman flickered a glance sideways at our escort and having received the
nod did not bother to demand identification.
'I'm afraid Keith is occupied at the moment. He's in virtual with New York.'

'Well get him out of virtual then,' said Ortega with dangerous mildness. 'And tell
him the officer who arrested his client is here to see him. I'm sure he'll be
interested.'
'That may take some time, officer.'
'No, it won't.'
The two women locked gazes for a moment, and then the lawyer looked away.
She nodded to the muscle, who went back outside, still looking disappointed.
'I'll see what I can do,' she said glacially. 'Please wait here.'
We waited, Ortega at the floor-to-ceiling window, staring down at the beach with
her back to the room and myself prowling the artwork. Some of it was quite
good. With the separately ingrained habits of working in monitored environments, neither of us said anything for the ten minutes it took to produce
Rutherford from the inner sanctum.
'Lieutenant Ortega.' The modulated voice reminded me of Miller's at the clinic,
and when I looked up from a print over the fireplace, I saw much the same kind
of sleeve. Maybe a little older, with slightly craggier patriarchal features
designed to inspire instant respect in jurors and judges alike, but the same
athletic frame and off-the-rack good looks. 'To what do I owe this unexpected
visit? Not more harassment, I hope.'
Ortega ignored the allegation. 'Detective Sergeant Elias Ryker,' she said, nodding
at me. 'Your client just admitted to one count of abduction, and made a first
degree organic damage threat under monitor. Care to see the footage?'
'Not particularly. Care to tell me why you're here?'
Rutherford was good. He'd barely reacted; barely, but enough to catch it out of
the corner of my eye. My mind went into overdrive.
Ortega leaned on the back of an armchair. 'For a man defending a mandatory
erasure case, you're showing a real lack of imagination.'
Rutherford sighed theatrically. 'You have called me away from an important link.
I assume you do have something to say.'

'Do you know what third party retro-associative complicity is?' I asked the
question without turning from the print, and when I did lookup, I had
Rutherford's complete attention.
'I do not,' he said stiffly.
'That's a pity, because you and the other partners of Prendergast Sanchez are
right in the firing line if Kadmin rolls over. But of course, if that happens — ' I
spread my hands and shrugged ' — it'll be open season. In fact, it may already
be.'
'All right, that's enough.' Rutherford's hand rose decisively to a remote summons
emitter pinned to his lapel. Our escort was on his way. 'I don't have time to play
games with you. There is no statute by that name, and this is getting perilously
close to harassment.'
I raised my voice. 'Just wanted to know which side you want to be on when the
program crashes, Rutherford. There is a statute. UN indictable offence, last
handed down 4th May 2207. Look it up. I had to go back a long way to dig this
one up, but it'll take all of you down in the end. Kadmin knows it, that's why he's
cracking.'
Rutherford smiled. 'I don't think so, detective.'
I repeated my shrug. 'Shame. Like I said, look it up. Then decide which side you
want to play for. We're going to need inside corroboration, and we're prepared to
pay for it. If it isn't you, Ulan Bator's stuffed with lawyers who'll give blow jobs
for the chance.'
The smile wavered fractionally.
'That's right, think about it.' I nodded at Ortega. 'You can get me at Fell Street,
same as the lieutenant here. Elias Ryker, offworld liaison. I'm promising you,
this is going to go down, whatever happens, and when it does, I'll be a good
person to know.'
Ortega took the cue like she'd been doing it all her life. Like Sarah would have
done. She unleaned herself from the chairback and made for the door.
'Be seeing you, Rutherford,' she said laconically, as we stepped back out onto the

deck. The muscle was there, grinning widely and flexing his hands at his sides.
'And you, don't even think about it.'
I contented myself with the silent look that I had been told Ryker used to such
great effect and followed my partner down the stairs.

Back in the cruiser, Ortega snapped on a screen and watched identity data from
the bug scroll down.
'Where'd you put it?'
'Print over the fireplace. Corner of the frame.'
She grunted. 'They'll sweep it out of there in nothing flat, you know. And none
of it's admissible as evidence, anyway.'
'I know. You've told me that twice already. That's not the point. If Rutherford's
rattled, he'll jump first.'
'You think he's rattled?'
'A little.'
'Yeah.' She glanced curiously at me. 'So what the fuck is third party retroassociative complicity?'
'No idea. I made it up.'
Her eyebrow went up. 'No shit?'
'Convinced you, huh? Know what, you could have given me a polygraph test
while I was spinning it, and I would have convinced that too. Basic Envoy tricks.
Course, Rutherford will know that as soon as he looks it up, but it's already
served its purpose.'
'Which is what?'
'Provide the arena. Tell lies, you keep your opponent off balance. It's like
fighting on unfamiliar ground. Rutherford was rattled, but he smiled when I told

him this stuff was why Kadmin was acting up.' I looked up through the
windscreen at the house above, formulating the scrapings of intuition into
understanding. 'He was fucking relieved when I said that. I don't suppose
normally he would have given that much away, but the bluff had him running
scared, and him knowing better than me about something was that little ray of
stability he needed. And that means he knows another reason why Kadmin
changed behaviour. He knows the real reason.'
Ortega grunted approvingly. 'Pretty good, Kovacs. You should have been a cop.
You notice his reaction when I told him the good news about what Kadmin had
done? He wasn't surprised at all.'
'No. He was expecting it. Or something like it.'
'Yeah.' She paused. 'This really what you used to do for a living?'
'Sometimes. Diplomatic missions, or deep-cover stuff. It wasn't —
I fell silent as she elbowed me in the ribs. On the screen, a series of coded
sequences were unwinding like snakes of blue fire.
'Here we go. Simultaneous calls, he must be doing this in virtual to save time.
One, two, three — that one's New York, must be to update the senior partners,
and oops.'
The screen flared and went abruptly dark.
'They found it,' I said.
'They did. The New York line probably has a sweeper attached, flushes out the
call vicinity on connection.'
'Or one of the others does.'
'Yeah.' Ortega punched up the screen's memory and stared at the call codes.
'They're all three routed through discreet clearing. Take us a while to locate
them. You want to eat?'

Homesickness isn't something a veteran Envoy should confess to. If the
conditioning hasn't already ironed it out of you, the years of sleeving back and
forth across the Protectorate should have done. Envoys are citizens of that
elusive state, Here-and-Now, a state that jealously admits of no dual
nationalities. The past is relevant only as data.
Homesickness was what I felt as we stepped past the kitchen area of the Flying
Fish and the aroma of sauces I had last tasted in Millsport hit me like a friendly
tentacle.
Teriyaki, frying tempura and the undercurrent of miso. I stood wrapped in it for a
moment, remembering that time. A ramen bar Sarah and I had skulked in while
the heat from the Gemini Biosys gig died down, eyes hooked to newsnet
broadcasts and a corner videophone with a smashed screen that was supposed to
ring, any time now. Steam on the windows and the company of taciturn
Millsport skippers.
And back beyond that, I remembered the moth-battered paper lanterns outside
Watanabe's on a Newpest Friday night. My teenage skin slick with sweat from
the jungle wind blowing out of the south and my eyes glittering with tetrameth in
one of the big windchime mirrors. Talk, cheaper than the big bowls of ramen,
about big scores and yakuza connections, tickets north and beyond, new sleeves
and new worlds. Old Watanabe had sat out on the deck with us, listening to it all
but never commenting, just smoking his pipes and glancing from time to time in
the mirror at his own Caucasian features — always with mild surprise, it seemed
to me.
He never told us how he'd got that sleeve, just as he never denied or confirmed
the rumours about his escapades with the marine corps, the Quell Memorial
Brigade, the Envoys, whatever. An older gang member once told us he'd seen
Watanabe face down a roomful of Seven Per Cent Angels with nothing but his
pipe in his hands, and some kid from the swamp towns once came up with a
fuzzy slice of newsreel footage he claimed was from the Settlement wars. It was
only two-d, hurriedly shot just before an assault team went over the top, but the
sergeant being interviewed was subtitled Watanabe, Y and there was something
about the way he tilted his head when questioned that had us all crowing
recognition at the screen. But then Watanabe was a common enough name, and
come to that, the guy who said he'd seen the Angels facedown was also fond of
telling us how he'd slept with a Harlan family heiress when she came slumming,

and none of us believed that.
Once, on a rare evening when I was both straight and alone at Watanabe's, I
swallowed enough of my adolescent pride to ask the old man for his advice. I'd
been reading UN armed forces promotional literature for weeks, and I needed
someone to push me one way or the other.
Watanabe just grinned at me around the stem of his pipe. 'I should advise you?'
he asked. 'Share with you the wisdom that brought me to this?'
We both looked around the little bar and the fields beyond the deck.
'Well, uh, yes.'
'Well, uh, no,' he said firmly, and resumed his pipe.
'Kovacs?'
I blinked and found Ortega in front of me, looking curiously into my eyes.
'Something I need to know about?'
I smiled faintly and glanced around at the kitchen's shining steel counters. 'Not
really.'
'It's good food,' she said, misinterpreting the look.
'Well, let's get some, then.'
She led me out of the steam and onto one of the restaurant's gantries. The Flying
Fish was, according to Ortega, a decommissioned aerial minesweeper that some
oceanographic institute had bought up. The institute was now either defunct or
had moved on and the bayward-facing facility had been gutted, but someone had
stripped the Flying Fish, rerigged her as a restaurant and cabled her five hundred
metres above the decaying facility buildings. Periodically the whole vessel was
reeled gently back down to earth to disgorge its sated customers and take on
fresh. There was a queue around two sides of the docking hangar when we
arrived but Ortega jumped it with her badge, and when the airship came floating
down through the open roof of the hangar, we were the first aboard.

I settled cross-legged onto cushions at a table that was secured to the blimp's hull
on a metal arm and thus did not touch the gantry at all. The gantry itself was
cordoned with the faint haze of a power screen that kept the temperature decent
and the gusting wind to a pleasant breeze. Around me the hexagonal grating
floor allowed me an almost uninterrupted view past the edge of the cushions to
the sea a kilometre below. I shifted uneasily. Heights had never been my strong
point.
'Used to use it for tracking whales and stuff,' said Ortega, gesturing sideways at
the hull. 'Back before places like this could afford the satellite time. Course, with
Understanding Day, the whales were suddenly big money for anyone who could
talk to them. You know they've told us almost as much about the Martians as
four centuries of archaeologues on Mars itself. Christ, they remember them
coming here. Race memory, that is.'
She paused. 'I was born on Understanding Day,' she added inconsequentially.
'Really?'
'Yep. January 9th. They named me Kristin after some whale scientist in
Australia, worked on the original translation team.'
'Nice.'
Who she was really talking to caught up with her. She shrugged, abruptly
dismissive. 'When you're a kid you don't see it that way. I wanted to be called
Maria.'
'You come here often?'
'Not often. But I figured anyone out of Harlan's World would like it.'
'Good guess.'
A waiter arrived and carved the menu into the air between us with a holotorch. I
glanced briefly down the list and selected one of the ramen bowls at random.
Something vegetarian.
'Good choice,' said Ortega. She nodded at the waiter. 'I'll have the same. And
juice. You want anything to drink?'

'Water.'
Our selections flared briefly in pink and the menu disappeared. The waiter
pocketed the holotorch at his breast with a snappy gesture and withdrew. Ortega
looked around her, seeking neutral conversation.
'So, uh — you got places like this in Millsport?'
'On the ground, yes. We're not big on aerial stuff.'
'No?' She raised her customary eyebrow. 'Millsport's an archipelago, isn't it? I
would have thought airships were — '
An obvious solution to the real estate shortage? Right as far as that goes, but I
think you're forgetting something.' I flicked my eyes skywards. 'We Are Not
Alone.'
It clicked. 'The orbitals? They're hostile?'
'Mmm. Let's say capricious. They tend to shoot down anything airborne that
masses more than a helicopter. And since no one's ever been able to get close
enough to decommission one of them, or even get aboard, come to that, we have
no way of knowing what their exact programming parameters are. So we just
play it safe, and don't go up in the air much.'
'Must make IP traffic tough.'
I nodded. 'Well, yeah. Course, there isn't much traffic anyway. No other
habitable planets in the system, and we're still too busy exploiting the World to
bother about terraforming. Few exploration probes, and maintenance shuttles to
the Platforms. Bit of exotic element mining, that's about it. And there are a
couple of launch windows down around the equator towards evening and one
crack of dawn slot up on the pole. It looks like a couple of orbitals must have
crashed and burned, way back when, left holes in the net.' I paused. 'Or maybe
someone shot them down.'
'Someone? You mean someone, not the Martians?'
I spread my hands. 'Why not? Everything they've ever found on Mars was razed
or buried. Or so well disguised we spent decades looking right at it before we

even realised it was there. It's the same on most of the Settled worlds. All the
evidence points to some kind of conflict out there.'
'But the archaeologues say it was a civil war, a colonial war.'
'Yeah, right.' I folded my arms and sat back. 'The archaeologues say what the
Protectorate tells them to say, and right now it's fashionable to deplore the
tragedy of the Martian domain tearing itself apart and sinking via barbarism into
extinction. Big warning for the inheritors. Don't rebel against your lawful rulers,
for the good of all civilisation.'
Ortega looked nervously around her. Conversation at some of the nearer tables
had skittered and jarred to a halt. I gave the spectators a wide smile.
'Do you mind if we talk about something else?' Ortega asked uncomfortably.
'Sure. Tell me about Ryker.'
The discomfort vanished into an icy stillness. Ortega put her hands flat on the
table in front of her and looked at them.
'No, I don't think so,' she said eventually.
'Fair enough.' I watched cloud formations shimmer in the haze of the power
screen for a while, and avoided looking down at the sea below me. 'But I think
you want to, really.'
'How very male of you.'
The food arrived and we ate in silence broken only by the traditional slurping.
Despite the Hendrix's perfectly balanced autochef breakfast, I discovered I was
ravenous. The food had triggered a hunger in me deeper than the needs of my
stomach. I was draining the dregs of my bowl before Ortega had got halfway
through hers.
'Food OK?' she asked ironically as I sat back.
I nodded, trying to wipe away the skeins of memory associated with the ramen,
but unwilling to bring the Envoy conditioning online and spoil the sated feeling
in my belly. Looking around at the clean metal lines of the dining gantry and the

sky beyond, I was as close to totally contented as I had been since Miriam
Bancroft left me drained in the Hendrix.
Ortega's phone shrilled. She unpocketed it and answered, still chewing her last
mouthful.
'Yeah? Uhuh. Uhuh, good. No, we'll go.' Her eyes nickered briefly to mine. 'That
so? No, leave that one too. It'll keep. Yeah, thanks Zak. Owe you one.'
She stowed the phone again and resumed eating.
'Good news?'
'Depends on your point of view. They traced the two local calls. One to a
fightdrome over in Richmond, place I know. We'll go down and take a look.'
'And the other call?'
Ortega looked up at me from her bowl, chewed and swallowed. 'The other
number was a residential discreet. Bancroft residence. Suntouch House. Now
what, exactly, do you make of that?'

CHAPTER NINETEEN

Ortega's fightdrome was an ancient bulk carrier, moored up in the north end of
the Bay, alongside acres of abandoned warehouses. The vessel must have been
over half a kilometre long with six clearly discernible cargo cells between stem
and stern. The one at the rear appeared to be open. From the air, the body of the
carrier was a uniform orange that I assumed was rust.
'Don't let it fool you,' Ortega grunted as we circled. 'They've polymered the hull
a quarter-metre thick all over. Take a shaped charge to sink it now.'
'Expensive.'
She shrugged. 'They've got the backing.'
We landed on the quay. Ortega killed the motors and leaned across me to peer up
at the ship's superstructure, which at a glance appeared to be deserted. I pushed
myself back into the seat a little, discomfited in equal parts by the pressure of the
lithe torso in my lap and my slightly overfull stomach. She felt the movement,
seemed suddenly to realise what she was doing and pulled herself abruptly
upright again.
'No one home,' she said awkwardly.
'So it seems. Shall we go and have a look?'

We got out into the customary blanket-snap of wind off the Bay and made for a
tubular aluminium gangway that led onto the vessel near the stern. It was
uncomfortably open ground, and I crossed it with an eye constantly sweeping the
railed and craned lines of the ship's deck and bridge tower. Nothing stirred. I
squeezed my left arm lightly against my side to check the Fibregrip holster
hadn't slipped down, as the cheaper varieties often did after a couple of days'
wear. With the Nemex I was tolerably sure I could air out anyone shooting at us
from the rail.
In the event it wasn't necessary. We reached the end of the gangway without
incident. A slim chain was fixed across the open entrance with a hand-lettered
sign hung on it.
PANAMA ROSE
FIGHT TONITE — 22.00
GATE PRICE DOUBLE

I lifted the rectangle of thin metal and looked at the crude lettering dubiously.
'Are you sure Rutherford called here?'
'Like I said before, don't let it fool you.' Ortega was unhooking the chain.
'Fighter chic. Crude's the in thing. Last season it was neon signs, but even that's
not cool enough now. Place is fucking globally hyped. Only about three or four
like it on the planet. There's no coverage allowed in the arenas. No holos, not
even televisuals. You coming, or what?'
'Weird.' I followed her down the tubular corridor, thinking of the freak fights I'd
gone to when I was younger. On Harlan's World, all fights were broadcast. They
got the highest viewing figures of any transmitted entertainment online. 'Don't
people like watching this sort of stuff?'
'Yeah, of course they do.' Even with the distortion of the echoing corridor, I
could hear Ortega's lip curling in the tone of her voice. 'Never get enough of it.
That's how this scam works. See, first they set up the Creed — '

'Creed?'
'Yeah, Creed of Purity or some such shit. Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to
interrupt? Creed goes, you want to see the fight, you go see it in the flesh. That's
better than watching it on the web. More classy. So, limited audience seating,
sky-high demand. That makes the tickets very sexy, which makes them very
expensive, which makes them even more sexy and whoever thought of it just
rides that spiral up through the roof.'
'Smart.'
'Yeah, smart.'
We came to the end of the gangway, and stepped out again onto a wind-whipped
deck. On either side of us the roofing of two of the cargo cells swelled smoothly
to waist height like two enormous steel blisters on the ship's skin. Beyond the
rear swelling, the bridge towered blankly into the sky, seeming entirely
unconnected with the hull we were standing on. The only motion came from the
chains of a loading crane ahead of us that the wind had set swinging fractionally.
'The last time I was out here,' said Ortega, raising her voice to compete with the
wind, 'was because some dipshit newsprick from WorldWeb One got caught
trying to walk recording implants into a title fight. They threw him into the Bay.
After they'd removed the implants with a pair of pliers.'
'Nice.'
'Like I said, it's a classy place.'
'Such flattery, lieutenant. I hardly know how to respond.'
The voice coughed from rusty-looking tannoy horns set on two-metre-high stalks
along the rail. My hand flew to the Nemex butt, and my vision cycled out to
peripheral scan with a rapidity that hurt. Ortega gave me an almost imperceptible
shake of the head and looked up at the bridge. The two of us swept the
superstructure for movement in opposite directions, coordinating unconsciously.
Under the immediacy of the tension, I felt a warm shiver of pleasure at that
unlooked-for symmetry.
'No, no. Over here,' said the metallic voice, this time relegated to the horns at the

stern. As I watched, the chains on one of the rear loading cranes grated into
motion and began to run, presumably hauling something up from the open cell in
front of the bridge. I left my hand on the Nemex. Overhead, the sun was
breaking through the cloud cover.
The chain ended in a massive iron hook, in the crook of which stood the speaker,
one hand still holding a prehistoric tannoy microphone, the other gripped lightly
around the rising chain. He was dressed in an inappropriate-looking grey suit
that flapped in the wind, leaning out from the chain at a fastidious angle, hair
glinting in a wandering shaft of sunlight. I narrowed my eyes to confirm.
Synthetic. Cheap synthetic.
The crane swung out over the curved cover of the cargo cell and the synth
alighted elegantly on the top, looking down on us.
'Elias Ryker,' he said, and his voice was not much smoother than the tannoy had
been. Someone had done a real cut-rate job on the vocal cords. He shook his
head. 'We thought we'd seen the last of you. How short the legislature's memory.'
'Carnage?' Ortega lifted a hand to shade against the sudden sunlight. 'That you?'
The synthetic bowed faintly and stowed the tannoy mike inside his jacket. He
began to pick his way down the sloping cell cover.
'Emcee Carnage, at your service, officers. And pray what have we done to offend
today?'
I said nothing. From the sound of it, I was supposed to know this Carnage, and I
didn't have enough to work with at the moment. Remembering what Ortega had
told me, I fixed the approaching synth with a blank stare, and hoped I was being
sufficiently Ryker-like.
The synthetic reached the edge of the cell cover and jumped down. Up close, I
saw that it wasn't only the vocal cords that were crude. This body was so far
from the one Trepp had been using when I torched her, it was barely deserving
of the same name. I wondered briefly if it was some kind of antique. The black
hair was coarse and enamelled-looking, the face slack silicoflesh, the pale blue
eyes clearly logo'd across the white. The body looked solid, but a little too solid,
and the arms were slightly wrong, reminiscent of snakes rather than limbs. The
hands at the ends of the cuffs were smooth and lineless. The synth offered one

featureless palm, as if for inspection.
'Well?' he asked gently.
'Routine check, Carnage,' said Ortega, helping me out. 'Been some bomb threats
on tonight's fight. We're here to have a look.'
Carnage laughed, jarringly. 'As if you cared.'
'Well, like I said,' Ortega answered evenly, 'it's routine.'
'Oh well, you'd better come along then.' The synthetic sighed and nodded at me.
'What's the matter with him? Did they lose his speech functions in the stack?'
We followed him towards the back of the ship and found ourselves skirting the
pit formed by the rolled-back cover of the rearmost cargo cell. I glanced down
inside and saw a circular white fighting ring, walled on four sides by slopes of
steel and plastic seating. Banks of lighting equipment were strung above but
there were none of the spiky spherical units I associated with telemetry. In the
centre of the ring, someone was knelt, painting a design ori the mat by hand. He
looked up as we passed.
'Thematic,' said Carnage, seeing where I was looking. 'Means something in
Arabic. This season's fights are all themed around Protectorate police actions.
Tonight it's Sharya. Right Hand of God Martyrs versus Protec Marines. Hand to
hand, no blades over ten centimetres.'
'Bloodbath, in other words,' said Ortega.
The synth shrugged. 'What the public wants, the public pays for. I understand it
is possible to inflict an outright mortal wound with a ten-centimetre blade. Just
very difficult. A real test of skill, they say. This way.'
We went down a narrow companionway into the body of the ship, our own
footsteps clanging around us in the tight confines.
'Arenas first, I presume,' Carnage shouted above the echoes.
'No, let's see the tanks first,' suggested Ortega.

'Really?' It was hard to tell with the low-grade synthetic voice, but Carnage
seemed to be amused. 'Are you quite sure it's a bomb you're looking for,
lieutenant? It seems to me the arena would be the obvious place to — '
'Got something to hide, Carnage?'
The synthetic turned back to look at me for a moment, quizzically. 'No, not at all,
detective Ryker. The tanks it is, then. Welcome to the conversation, by the way.
Was it cold on stack? Of course, you probably never expected to be there
yourself.'
'That's enough.' Ortega interposed herself. 'Just take us to the tanks and save the
small talk for tonight.'
'But of course. We aim to co-operate with law enforcement. As a legally
incorporated — '
'Yeah, yeah.' Ortega waved the verbiage away with weary patience. 'Just take us
to the fucking tanks.'
I reverted to my dangerous stare.
We rode to the tank area in a dinky little electromag train that ran along one side
of the hull, through two more converted cargo cells equipped with the same
fighting rings and banks of seats but this time covered over with plastic sheeting.
At the far end, we disembarked and stepped through the customary sonic
cleansing lock. A great deal dirtier than PsychaSec's facilities, ostensibly made
of black iron, the heavy door swung outward to reveal a spotlessly white interior.
'At this point we dispense with image,' said Carnage carelessly. 'Bare bones lowtech is all very well for the audience, but behind the scenes, well,' he gestured
around at the gleaming facilities, 'you can't make an omelette without a little oil
in the pan.'
The forward cargo section was huge and chilly, the lighting gloomy, the
technology aggressively massive. Where Bancroft's low-lit womb mausoleum at
PsychaSec had spoken in soft, cultured tones of the trappings of wealth, where
the re-sleeving room at the Bay City storage facility had groaned minimal
funding for minimal deservers, the Panama Rose's body bank was a brutal growl
of power. The storage tubes were racked on heavy chains like torpedoes on

either side of us, jacked into a central monitor system at one end of the hold via
thick black cables that twisted across the floor like pythons. The monitor unit
itself squatted heavily ahead of us like an altar to some unpleasant spider god.
We approached it on a metal jetty raised a quarter-metre above the frozen
writhings of the data cables. Behind it to left and right, set into the far wall, were
the square glass sides of two spacious decanting tanks. The right-hand tank
already held a sleeve, floating backlit and tethered cruciform by monitor lines.
It was like walking into the Andric cathedral in Newpest.
Carnage walked to the central monitor, turned and spread his arms rather like the
sleeve above and behind him.
'Where would you like to start? I assume you've brought sophisticated bomb
detection equipment with you.'
Ortega ignored him. She took a couple of steps closer to the decanting tank and
looked up into the wash of cool green light it cast down into the gloom. 'This one
of tonight's whores?' she asked.
Carnage sniffed. 'In not so many words, it is. I do wish you'd understand the
difference between what they peddle in those greasy little shops down the coast,
and this.'
'So do I,' Ortega told him, eyes still upward on the body. 'Where'd you get this
one from, then?'
'How should I know?' Carnage made a show of studying the plastic nails on his
right hand. 'Oh, we have the bill of sale somewhere, if you must look. By the
look of him, I'd say this one's out of Nippon Organics, or one of the Pacific Rim
combines. Does it really matter?'
I went to the wall and stared up at the floating sleeve. Slim, hard-looking and
brown, with the delicately lifted Japanese eyes on the shelf of unscaleably high
cheekbones, a thick, straight drift of impenetrably black hair like seaweed in the
tank fluid. Gracefully flexible with the long hands of an artist, but muscled for
speed combat. It was the body of a tech ninja, the body I'd dreamed about having
at fifteen, on dreary rain-filled days in Newpest. It wasn't far off the sleeve they'd
given me to fight the Sharya war in. It was a variation on the sleeve I'd bought
with my first big pay-off in Millsport, the sleeve I'd met Sarah in.

It was like looking at myself under glass. The self I'd built somewhere in the
coils of memory that trail all the way back to childhood. Suddenly I stood, exiled
into Caucasian flesh, on the wrong side of the mirror.
Carnage came up to me and slapped the glass. 'You approve, detective Ryker?'
When I said nothing, he went on. 'I'm sure you do, someone with your appetite
for, well, brawling. The specs are quite remarkable. Reinforced chassis, the
bones are all culture-grown marrow alloy jointed with polybond ligamenting,
carbon-reinforced tendons, Khumalo neurachem — '
'Got neurachem,' I said, for something to say.
'I know all about your neurachem, detective Ryker.' Even through the poorquality voice, I thought I could hear a soft, sticky delight. 'The fightdrome
scanned your specs when you were on stack. There was some talk of buying you
up, you know. Physically I mean. It was thought your sleeve could be used in a
humiliation bout. Faked, of course, we would never dream of the actual thing
here. That would be, well, criminal? Carnage paused dramatically. 'But then it
was decided that humiliation fights were not the, uh, the spirit of the
establishment. A lowering of tone, you understand. Not a real contest.
Shame really, with all the friends you've made, it would have been a big crowdpuller.'
I wasn't really listening to him, but it dawned on me that Ryker was being
insulted and I pivoted away from the glass to fix Carnage with what seemed like
an appropriate glare.
'But I digress,' the synthetic went on smoothly. 'What I meant to say is that your
neurachem is to this system as my voice is to that of Anchana Salomao. This,' he
gestured once more at the tank, 'is Khumalo neurachem, patented by Cape
Neuronics only last year. A development of almost spiritual proportions. There
are no synaptic chemical amplifiers, no servo chips or implanted wiring. The
system is grown in, and it responds directly to thought. Consider that, detective.
No one offworld has it yet, the UN are thought to be considering a ten-year
colonial embargo, though myself I doubt the efficacy of such — '
'Carnage.' Ortega drifted in behind him, impatiently. 'Why haven't you decanted
the other fighter yet?'

'But we are doing, lieutenant.' Carnage waved one hand at the rack of body tubes
on the left. From behind them came the sound of prowling heavy machinery. I
peered into the gloom and made out a big automated forklift unit rolling down
the rows of containers. As we watched, it locked to a stop and bright, directed
lighting sprang up on its frame. The forks reached and clamped on a tube,
extracting it from the chained cradle while smaller servos disconnected the
cabling from it. Separation complete, the machine withdrew slightly, swivelled
about and trundled back along the rows towards the empty decanting tank.
'The system is entirely automated,' said Carnage superfluously.
Below the tank, I now noticed a line of three circular openings, like the forward
discharge ports of an IP dreadnought. The forklift rose up a little on hydraulic
pistons and loaded the tube it was carrying smoothly into the centre port. The
tube fitted snugly, the visible end rotating through about ninety degrees before a
steel baffle slammed down over it. Its task completed, the forklift sank back
down on its hydraulics and its engines died.
I watched the tank.
It seemed like a while, but in fact probably took less than a minute. A hatch
broke open in the floor of the tank and a silvery shoal of bubbles erupted
upwards. Drifting after them came the body. It bobbed fetally for a moment,
turning this way and that in the eddies caused by the air, then its arms and legs
began to unfold, aided by the gently tugging monitor wires secured at wrist and
ankle. It was bigger boned than the Khumalo sleeve, blocky and more heavily
muscled but similar in colour. A strong-boned, hawk-nosed visage tipped lazily
towards us as the thin wires pulled it upright.
'Sharyan Right Hand of God martyr,' said Carnage beamingly. 'Not really, of
course, but the race type's accurate and it's got an authentic Will of God
enhanced response system.' He nodded at the other tank. 'The marines on Sharya
were multi-racial, but there were enough Jap-types there to make it believable.'
'Not much of a contest, is it?' I said. 'State-of-the-art neurachem against centuryold Sharyan biomech.'
Carnage grinned with his slack silicoflesh face. 'Well, that will depend on the
fighters. I'm told the Khumalo system takes a bit of getting used to, and to be
honest it isn't always the best sleeve that wins. It's more about psychology.

Endurance, pain tolerance . . . '
'Savagery,' added Ortega. 'Lack of empathy.'
'Things like that,' agreed the synthetic. 'That's what makes it exciting, of course.
If you'd care to come tonight, lieutenant, detective, I'm sure I can find you a
couple of remaindered seats near the back.'
'You'll be commentating,' I surmised, already hearing the specs-rich vocabulary
that Carnage used come tumbling out over the tannoy, the killing ring drenched
in focused white light, the roaring, surging crowd in the darkened seating, the
smell of sweat and bloodlust.
'Of course I will.' Carnage's logo'd eyes narrowed. 'You haven't been away so
long, you know.'
'Are we going to look for these bombs?' said Ortega loudly.
It took us over an hour to go over the hold, looking for imaginary bombs, while
Carnage looked on with poorly veiled amusement. Up above, the two sleeves
destined for slaughter in the arena looked clown on us from their green-lit glasssided wombs, their presences weighing no less heavily for their closed eyes and
dreaming visages.

CHAPTER TWENTY

Ortega dropped me on Mission Street as evening was falling over the city. She'd
been withdrawn and monosyllabic on the flight back from the fightdrome, and I
guessed the strain of reminding herself I was not Ryker was beginning to take a
toll. But when I made a production of brushing off my shoulders as I got out of
the cruiser, she laughed impulsively.
'Stick around the Hendrix tomorrow,' she said. 'There's someone I want you to
talk to, but it'll take a while to set up.'
'Fair enough.' I turned to go.
'Kovacs.'
I turned back. She was leaning across to look up and out of the open door at me.
I put an arm on the uplifted door wing of the cruiser and looked down. There
was a longish pause during which I could feel my blood beginning to adrenalise
gently.
'Yes?'
She hesitated a moment longer, then said, 'Carnage was hiding something back
there, right?'
'From the amount he talked, I'd say yes.'

'That's what I thought.' She prodded hurriedly at the control console and the door
began to slide back down. 'See you tomorrow.'
I watched the cruiser into the sky and sighed. I was reasonably sure that going to
Ortega openly had been a good move, but I hadn't expected it to be so messy.
However long she and Ryker had been together, the chemistry must have been
devastating. I remembered reading somewhere how the initial pheromones of
attraction between bodies appeared to undergo a form of encoding the longer
said bodies were in proximity, binding them increasingly close. None of the
biochemists interviewed appeared to really understand the process, but: there
had been some attempts to play with it in labs. Speeding up or interrupting the
effect had met with mixed results, one of which was empathin and its
derivatives.
Chemicals. I was still reeling from the cocktail of Miriam Bancroft and I didn't
need this. I told myself, in no uncertain terms, I didn 't need this.
Up ahead, over the heads of the evening's scattered pedestrians, I saw the
holographic bulk of the left-handed guitar player outside the Hendrix. I sighed
again and started walking.
Halfway up the block, a bulky automated vehicle rolled past me, hugging the
kerb. It looked pretty much like the robocrawlers that cleaned the streets of
Millsport, so I paid no attention to it as it drew level. Seconds later, I was
drenched in the machine's image cast.
. . .from the houses from the houses from the houses from the houses from the
houses from the houses . . .
The voices groaned and murmured, male, female, overlaid. It was like a choir in
the throes of orgasm. The images were inescapable, varying across a broad
spectrum of sexual preference. A whirlwind of fleeting sensory impressions.
Genuine . . .
Uncut . . .
Full sense repro . . .
Tailored . . .

As if to prove this last, the random images thinned out into a stream of heterosex
combinations. They must have scanned my response to the blur of options and
fed directly back to the broadcast unit. Very high-tech.
The flow ended with a phone number in glowing numerals and an erect penis in
the hands of a woman with long dark hair and a crimson-lipped smile. She
looked into the lens. I could feel her fingers.
Head in the Clouds, she breathed. This is what it's like. Maybe you can't afford to
come up here, but you can certainly afford this.
Her head dipped, her lips slid down over the penis. Like it was happening to me.
Then the long black hair curtained in from either side and inked the image out. I
was back on the street, swaying, coated in a thin sheen of sweat. The autocaster
grumbled away down the street behind me, some of the more streetwise
pedestrians skipping sharply sideways out of its cast radius.
I found I could recall the phone number with gleaming clarity.
The sweat cooled rapidly to a shiver. I flexed my shoulders and started walking,
trying not to notice the knowing looks of the people around me. I was almost
into a full stride again when a gap opened in the strollers ahead and I saw the
long, low limousine parked outside the Hendrix's front doors.
Jangling nerves sent my hand leaping towards the holstered Nemex before I
recognised the vehicle as Bancroft's. Forcing out a deep breath, I circled the
limousine and ascertained that the driver's compartment was empty. I was still
wondering what to do when the rear compartment hatch cracked open and Curtis
unfolded himself from the seating inside.
'We need to talk, Kovacs,' he said in a man-to-man sort of voice that put me on
the edge of a slightly hysterical giggle. 'Decision time.'
I looked him up and down, reckoned from the tiny eddies in his stance and
demeanour that he was chemically augmented at the moment, and decided to
humour him.
'Sure. In the limo?'
' 'S cramped in there. How about you ask me up to your room?'

My eyes narrowed. There was an unmistakable hostility in the chauffeur's voice,
and a just as unmistakable hard-on pressing at the front of his immaculate
chinos. Granted, I had a similar, if detumescing, lump of my own, but I
remembered distinctly that Bancroft's limo had shielding against the street 'casts.
This was something else.
I nodded at the hotel entrance.
'OK, let's go.'
The doors parted to let us in and the Hendrix came to life.
'Good evening, sir. You have no visitors this evening — '
Curtis snorted. 'Disappointed, hah, Kovacs?'
' — nor any calls since you left.' The hotel continued smoothly. 'Do you wish this
person admitted as a guest.'
'Yeah, sure. You got a bar we can go to?'
'I said your room,' growled Curtis, behind me, then yelped as he barked his shin
on one of the lobby's low metal-edged tables.
'The Midnight Lamp bar is located on this floor,' said the hotel doubtfully, 'but
has not been used for a considerable time.'
'I said — '
'Shut up, Curtis. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to rush a first date? The
Midnight Lamp is fine. Fire it up for us.'
Across the lobby, adjacent to the check-in console, a wide section of the back
wall slid grudgingly aside and lights flickered on in the space beyond. With
Curtis making sneering sounds behind me, I went to the opening and peered
down a short flight of steps into the Midnight Lamp bar.
'This'll do fine. Come on.'
Someone overliteral in imagination had done the interior decoration of the

Midnight Lamp bar. The walls, themselves psychedelic whirls of midnight blues
and purples, were festooned with a variety of clock faces showing either the
declared hour or a few minutes to, interwoven with every form of lamp known to
man, from clay prehistoric to enzyme decay light canisters. There was indented
bench seating along both walls, clock-face tables and in the centre of the room a
circular bar in the shape of a countdown dial. A robot composed entirely of
clocks and lamps waited immobile just beside the dial's twelve mark.
It was all the more eerie for the complete absence of any other customers, and as
we made our way towards the waiting robot, I could feel Curtis's earlier mood
quieten a little.
'What will it be, gentlemen?' said the machine unexpectedly, from no apparent
vocal outlet. Its face was an antique white analogue clock with spider-thin
baroque hands and the hours marked off in Roman numerals. A little unnerved, I
turned back to Curtis, whose face was showing signs of unwilling sobriety.
'Vodka,' he said shortly. 'Subzero.'
'And a whisky. Whatever it is I've been drinking out of the cabinet in my room.
At room temperature, please. Both on my tab.'
The clock face inclined slightly and one multi-jointed arm swung up to select
glasses from an overhead rack. The other arm, which ended in a lamp with a
forest of small spouts, trickled the requested spirits into the glasses.
Curtis picked up his glass and threw a generous portion of the vodka down his
throat. He drew breath hard through his teeth and made a satisfied growling
noise. I sipped at my own glass a little more circumspectly, wondering how long
it had been since liquid last flowed through the bar's tubes and spigots. My fears
proved unfounded, so I deepened the sip and let the whisky melt its way down
into my stomach.
Curtis banged down his glass.
'Now you ready to talk?'
'All right, Curtis,' I said slowly, looking into my drink. 'I imagine you have a
message for me.'

'Sure have.' His voice was cranked to snapping point. 'The lady says, you going
to take her very generous offer, or not. Just that. I'm supposed to give you time to
make up your mind, so I'll finish my drink.'
I fixed my gaze on a Martian sand lamp hanging from the opposite wall. Curtis's
mood was beginning to make some sense.
'Muscling in on your territory, am I?'
'Don't push your luck, Kovacs.' There was a desperate edge to the words. 'You
say the wrong thing here, and I'll — '
'You'll what?' I set my glass down and turned to face him. He was less than half
my subjective age, young and muscled and chemically wound up in the illusion
that he was dangerous. He reminded me so much of myself at the same age it
was maddening. I wanted to shake him. 'You'll what?
Curtis gulped. 'I was in the provincial marines.'
'What as, a pin-up?' I went to push him in the chest with one stiffened hand, then
dropped it, ashamed. I lowered my voice. 'Listen, Curtis. Don't do this to us
both.'
'You think you're pretty fucking tough, don't: you?'
'This isn't about tough, C — urtis.' I'd almost called him kid. It seemed as if part
of me wanted the fight after all. 'This is about two different species. What did
they teach you in the provincial marines? Hand-to-hand combat? Twenty-seven
ways to kill a man with your hands? Underneath it all you're still a man. I'm an
Envoy, Curtis. It's not the same.'
He came for me anyway, leading with a straight jab that was supposed to distract
me while the following roundhouse kick scythed in from the side at head height.
It was a skull cracker if it landed, but it was hopelessly over-dramatic. Maybe it
was the chemicals he'd dressed up in that night. No one in their right mind
throws lacks above waist height in a real fight. I ducked the jab and the kick in
the same movement and grabbed his fool;. A sharp twist and Curtis tipped,
staggered and landed spreadeagled on the bar top. I smashed his face against the
unyielding surface and held him there with my hand knotted in his hair.

'See what I mean?'
He made muffled noises and thrashed impotently about while the clock-faced
bartender stood immobile. Blood from his broken nose was streaked across the
bar's surface. I studied the patterns it had made while I brought my breathing
back down. The lock I had on my conditioning was making me pant. Shifting my
grip to his right arm, I jerked it up high into the small of his back. The thrashing
stopped.
'Good. Now you keep still or I'll break it. I'm not in the mood for this.' As I
spoke, I was feeling rapidly through his pockets. In the inner breast pouch of his
jacket I found a small plastic tube. 'Aha. So what little delights have we got
tubing round your system tonight? Hormone enhancers, by the look of that hardon.' I held the tube up to the dim light and saw thousands of tiny crystal slivers
inside it. 'Military format. Where did you get this stuff, Curtis? Discharge freebie
from the marines, was it?' I recommenced my search and came up with the
delivery system: a tiny skeletal gun with a sliding chamber and a magnetic coil.
Tip the crystals into the breech and close it, the magnetic field aligns them and
the accelerator spits them out at penetrative speed. Not so different from Sarah's
shard pistol. For battlefield medics, they were a hardy, and consequently very
popular, alternative to hypo-sprays.
I hauled Curtis to his feet and shoved him away from me. He managed to stay on
his feet, clutching at his nose with one hand and glaring at me.
'You want to tip your head back to stop that,' I told him. 'Go ahead, I'm not going
to hurt you again.'
'Botherfucker!'
I held up the crystals and the little gun. 'Where did you get these?'
'Suck by prick, Kovacs.' Curtis tipped his head back fractionally, despite himself,
trying to keep me in view at the same time. His eyes rolled in their sockets like a
panicked horse's. Tb dot tellig you a fuckig thig.'
'Fair enough.' I put the chemicals back on the bar and regarded him gravely for a
couple of seconds. 'Then let me tell you something instead. When they make an
Envoy, do you want to know what they do? They burn out every evolved
violence limitation instinct in the human psyche. Submission signal recognition,

pecking order dynamics, pack loyalties. It all goes, tuned out a neuron at a time;
and they replace it with a conscious will to harm.'
He stared back at me in silence.
'Do you understand me? It would have been easier to kill you just then. It would
have been easier. I had to stop myself. That's what an Envoy is, Curtis. A
reassembled human. An artifice.'
The silence stretched. There was no way to know if he was taking it in or not.
Thinking back to Newpest a century and a half ago, and the young Takeshi
Kovacs, I doubted he was. At his age, the whole thing would have sounded like a
dream of power come true.
I shrugged. 'In case you hadn't guessed already, the answer to the lady's question
is no. I'm not interested. There, that should make you happy, and it only cost you
a broken nose to find out. If you hadn't dosed yourself to the eyes it might not
even have cost that much. Tell her thank you very much, the offer is appreciated,
but there's too much going on here to walk away from. Tell her I'm starting to
enjoy it.'
There was a slight cough from the entrance to the bar. I looked up and saw a
suited, crimson-haired figure on the stairs.
'Am I interrupting something?' The mohican enquired. The voice was slow and
relaxed. Not one of the heavies from Fell Street.
I picked up my drink from the bar. 'Not at all, officer. Come on down and join
the party. What'll you have?'
'Overproof rum,' said the cop, drifting over to us. 'If they've got it. Small glass.'
I raised a finger at the clock face. The bartender produced a square-cut glass
from somewhere and filled it with a deep red liquid. The mohican ambled past
Curtis, sparing him a curious glance on the way, and apprehended the drink with
a long arm.
'Appreciated.' He sipped at the drink and inclined his head. 'Not bad. I'd like a
word with you, Kovacs. In private.'

We both glanced at Curtis. The chauffeur glared back at me with hate-filled eyes,
but the new arrival had defused the confrontation. The cop jerked his head in the
direction of the exit. Curtis went, still clutching his wounded face. The cop
watched him out of sight before he turned back to me.
'You do that?' he asked casually.
I nodded. 'Provoked. Things got a bit out of hand. He thought he was protecting
someone.'
'Well, I'm glad he ain't protecting me.'
'Like I said, it got a bit out of hand. I overreacted.'
'Hell, you don't need to explain yourself to me.' The cop leaned on the bar and
looked around him with frank interest. I recalled his face now. Bay City storage.
The one with the quick-tarnishing badge. 'He feels aggrieved enough, he can
press charges and we'll play back some more of this place's memory.'
'Got your warrant, then?' I put the question with a lightness I didn't feel.
'Almost. Always takes a while with the legal department. Fucking AIs. Look, I
wanted to apologise for Mercer and Davidson, the way they were at the station.
They act like a brace of dickheads sometimes, but they're fundamentally OK.'
I waved my glass laterally. 'Forget it.'
'Good. I'm Rodrigo Bautista, detective sergeant. Ortega's partner most of the
time.' He drained his glass and grinned at me. 'Loosely attached, I should point
out.'
'Noted.' I signalled the bartender for refills. 'Tell me something. You guys all go
to the same hairdresser, or is it some kind of team bonding thing?'
'Same hairdresser.' Bautista shrugged sorrowfully. 'Old guy up on Fulton. Excon. Apparently mohicans were cool back when they threw him in the store. It's
the only goddamn style he knows, but he's a nice old guy and he's cheap. One of
us started going there a few years back, he gave us discounts. You know how it
is.'

'But not Ortega?'
'Ortega cuts her own hair.' Bautista made a what-can-you-do gesture. 'Got a little
holocast scanner, says it: improves her spatial coordination or some such shit.'
'Different.'
'Yeah, she is.' Bautista paused reflectively, gaze soaking up the middle distance.
He sipped absently at his freshened drink. 'It's her I'm here about.'
'Oh-oh. Is this going to be a friendly warning?'
Bautista pulled a face. 'Well, it's going to be friendly, whatever you call it. I ain't
looking for a broken nose.'
I laughed despite myself. Bautista joined me with a gentle smile.
'Thing is, it's tearing her up you walking around with that face on. She and Ryker
were real close. She's been paying the sleeve mortgage a year now, and on a lieutenant's pay that ain't an easy thing to do. Never figured on an overbid like that
fucker Bancroft pulled. After all, Ryker ain't exactly young and he never was a
beauty.'
'Got neurachem,' I pointed out.
'Oh, sure. Got neurachem.' Bautista waved an arm with largesse. 'You tried it
yet?'
'Couple of times.'
'Like dancing flamenco in a fishing net, right?'
'It's a little rough,' I admitted.
This time we both laughed. When it cranked down, the cop focused on his glass
again. His face grew serious.
'I ain't trying to lean on you. All I'm saying is, go easy. This ain't exactly what
she needs right now.'
'Me neither,' I said feelingly. 'This isn't even my nicking planet.'

Bautista looked sympathetic, or maybe just slightly drunk. 'Harlan’s World's a lot
different to this, I guess.'
'You guess right. Look, I don't mean to be unsubtle, but hasn't anyone pointed
out to Ortega that Ryker's as gone for good as it gets without real death? She's
not looking to wait two hundred years for him, is she?'
The cop looked at me through narrowed eyes. 'You heard about Ryker, huh?'
'I know he's down for the double barrel. I know what he went down for.'
Bautista got something in his eyes then that looked like shards of old pain. It
can't be much fun talking about your corrupt colleagues. For a moment I
regretted what I'd said.
Local colour. Soak it up.
'You want to sit down?' said the cop unhappily, casting around for bar stools that
had evidently been removed at some stage. 'Over in the booths, maybe? This'll
take a while to tell.'
We settled at one of the clock face tables and Bautista fumbled in his pocket for
cigarettes. I twitched, but when he offered me one I shook my head. Like Ortega,
he looked surprised.
'I quit.'
'In that sleeve?' Bautista's eyebrows lifted respectfully behind a veil of fragrant
blue smoke. 'Congratulations.'
'Thanks. You were going to tell me about Ryker.'
'Ryker,' the cop jetted smoke out of his nostrils and sat back, 'was working with
the Sleeve Theft boys until a couple of years ago. They're quite a sophisticated
bunch compared to us. It ain't so easy to steal a whole sleeve intact and that
breeds a smarter class of criminal. There's some crossover of jurisdiction with
Organic Damage, mostly when they start breaking down the bodies. Places like
the Wei Clinic.'
'Oh?' I said neutrally.

Bautista nodded. 'Yeah, someone saved us an awful lot of time and effort over
there yesterday. Turned the place into a spare parts sale. But I guess you
wouldn't know anything about that.'
'Must have happened as I was walking out the door.'
'Yeah, well anyway. Back in the winter of '09, Ryker was chasing down some
random insurance fraud, you know the stuff, where re-sleeve policy clones 'turn
out to be empty tanks and no one knows where the bodies went. It split wide
open and turns out the bodies are being used for some dirty little war down
south. High level corruption. It bounced all the way up to UN Praesidium level
and back. A few token heads roll, and Ryker gets to be a hero.'
'Nice.'
'In the short term, yeah. The way it works round here, heroes get a very high
profile and they went the whole program for Ryker. Interviews on WorldWeb
One, highly publicised fling with Sandy Kim even. Bylines in the faxes. Before
it all could tail off, Ryker grabbed his chance. Put in for a transfer to OrgDam.
He'd worked with Ortega a couple of times before, like I said we overlap here
and there, so he knew the program. No way could the department turn him
down, especially with some bullshit speech he made about wanting to go where
he could make a difference.'
'And did he? Make a difference, I mean?'
Bautista puffed out his cheeks. 'He was a good cop. Maybe. A month in you
could have asked Ortega that question, but then the two of them hooked up and
her judgement went all to pieces.'
'You don't approve?'
'Hey, what's to approve? You feel that way about someone, you go with it. It just
makes it tough to get any objectivity on this thing. When Ryker fucked up,
Ortega was bound to side with him.'
'Did she?' I took our empty glasses to the bar and got them refilled, still talking.
'I thought she brought him in.'
'Where'd you hear that?'

'Talk. Not a massively reputable source. It's not true, then?'
'Nah. Some of the street slime like to talk it up that way. I think the idea of us
ratting each other out makes them cream their pants. What happened was,
Internal Affairs took Ryker down in her apartment.'
'Ohhh.'
'Yeah, ain't that a laser up the ass.' Bautista looked up at me as I handed him his
new drink. 'She never let it show, you know. Just went right to work against the
IAD charges.'
'From what I heard, they had him cold.'
'Yeah, your source got that bit right.' The mohican looked into his glass
pensively, as if unsure he should go on. 'Ortega's theory was that Ryker was set
up by some high ranking asshole who took a fall back in '09. And it's true he
upset a lot of people.'
'But you don't buy it?'
'I'd like to. Like I said, he was a good cop. But like I also said, Sleeve Theft was
dealing to a smarter class of criminal, and that meant you had to be careful.
Smart criminals have smart lawyers, and you can't bounce them around
whenever you feel like it. Organic Damage handles everyone, from the scum on
up. Generally we get a bit more leeway. That was what you, sorry, what Ryker
wanted when he transferred. The leeway.' Bautista tipped back his glass and set
it down with a throat-clearing noise. He looked at me steadily. 'I think Ryker got
carried away.'
'Blam, blam, blam?'
'Something like that. I've seen him interrogate before, he's right on the line most
of the time. One slip.' There was an old terror in Bautista's eyes now. The fear he
lived with every day. 'With some of these turds, it's real easy to lose your cool.
So easy. I think that's what happened.'
'My source says he RD'd two and left another two with their stacks still intact.
That sounds pretty fucking careless.'

Bautista jerked his head affirmatively. 'What Ortega says. But it won't wash. See,
it all went down in a black clinic up in Seattle. The two intacts made it out of the
building breathing, grabbed a cruiser and flew. Ryker put a hundred twenty-four
holes in that cruiser when it lifted. Not to mention the surrounding traffic. The
intacts ditched in the Pacific. One of them died at the controls, the other one in
the impact. Sank in a couple of hundred metres of water. Ryker was out of his
jurisdiction, and the Seattle cops ain't all that keen on out-of-town badges
shooting up the traffic, so the retrieval teams never let him close to the bodies.
'Everyone was real surprised when the stacks came up Catholic, and someone at
the Seattle PD wasn't buying. Dig a little bit deeper and it turns out the reasonsof-conscience decals are fake. Dipped in by someone real careless.'
'Or in a real hurry.'
Bautista snapped his fingers and pointed a finger across the table at: me. He was
definitely a little drunk now. 'There you go. The way IAD read it, Ryker'd
screwed up letting the witnesses escape, and his only hope was to slap a "do not
disturb" sign on their stacks. Course, when they did bring back the intacts, they
both swore blind that Ryker had turned up without a warrant, bluffed and then
smashed his way into the clinic, and when they wouldn't answer his questions,
started playing Who's Next with a plasma gun.'
'Was it true?'
'About the warrant? Yeah. Ryker had no business being up there in the first
place. About the rest? Who knows?'
'What did Ryker say?'
'He said he didn't do it.'
'Just that?'
'Nah, it was a long story. He'd gone up on a tip, bluffed himself inside just to see
how far he could push it and suddenly they were shooting at him. Claims he
might have taken someone out but probably not with a head shot. Claims the
clinic must have brought in two sacrificial employees and torched them before
he arrived. Claims he knows nothing about any Dipping that went on.' Bautista
shrugged blearily. 'They found the Dipper, and he said Ryker paid him to do it.

Polygraph-tested. But he also says Ryker called him up, didn't do it face to face.
Virtual link.'
'Which can be faked. Easily.'
'Yeah.' Bautista looked pleased. 'But then, this guy says he's done work for Ryker
before, this time face to face, and he polygraphed out on that too. Ryker knows
him, that's indisputable. And then, of course, IAD wanted to know why Ryker
didn't take any backup with him. They got witnesses in the street who said Ryker
was like a maniac, shooting blind, trying to bring the cruiser down. Seattle PD
didn't take too kindly to that, like I said.'
'A hundred and twenty-four holes,' I muttered.
'Yep. That's a lot of holes. Ryker wanted to bring those two intacts down pretty
badly.'
'It could have been a set-up.'
'Yeah, it could have been.' Bautista sobered up a little and his voice got angry.
'Could have been a lot of things. But the fact is that you, shit, sorry, the fact is
that Ryker went too far out, and when the branch broke there was no one there to
catch him.'
'So Ortega buys the set-up story, stands by Ryker and fights IAD all the way
down, and when they lose . . . ' I nodded to myself. 'When they lose, she picks up
the sleeve mortgage to keep Ryker's body out of the city auction room. And goes
looking for fresh evidence?'
'Got it in one. She's already lodged an appeal, but there's a minimum two-year
elapse from start of sentence before she can get the disc spinning.' Bautista let go
of a gut-deep sigh. 'Like I said, it's tearing her up.'
We sat quietly for a while.
'You know,' said Bautista finally. 'I think I'm going to go. Sitting here talking
about Ryker to Ryker's face is getting a little weird. I don't know how Ortega
copes.'
'Just part of living in the modern age,' I told him, knocking back my drink.

'Yeah, I guess. You'd think I'd have a handle on it by now. I spend half my life
talking to victims wearing other people's faces. Not to mention the scumbags.'
'So which do you make Ryker for? Victim or scumbag?'
Bautista frowned. 'That ain't a nice question. Ryker was a good cop who made a
mistake. That don't make him a scumbag. Don't make him a victim either. Just
makes him someone who screwed up. Me, I only live about a block away from
that myself.'
'Sure. Sorry.' I rubbed at the side of my face. Envoy conversations weren't
supposed to slip like that. 'I'm a little tired. That block you live on sounds
familiar. I think I'm going to go to bed. You want another drink before you go,
help yourself. It's on my tab.'
'No thanks.' Bautista drained what was left in his glass. 'Old cop's rule. Never
drink alone.'
'Sounds like I should have been an old cop.' I stood up, swaying a little. Ryker
may have been a death-wish smoker, but he didn't have much tolerance for
alcohol. 'You can see yourself out: OK, I guess.'
'Sure.' Bautista got up to go and made about a half dozen paces before he turned
back. He; frowned with concentration. 'Oh, yeah. Goes without saying, I was
never here, right.'
I gestured him away. 'You were never here,' I assured him.
He grinned bemusedly and his face looked suddenly very young. 'Right. Good.
See you round, probably.'
'See you.'
I watched him out of sight, then, regretfully, let the ice-cold processes of Envoy
control trickle down through my befuddled senses. When I was unpleasantly
sober again, I picked up Curtis's drug crystals from the bar, and went to talk to
the Hendrix.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

'You know anything about synamorphesterone?'
'Heard of it.' Ortega dug absently at the sand with the toe of one boot. It was still
damp from the tide's retreat, and our footprints welled soggily behind us. In
either direction the curve of the beach was deserted. We were alone apart from
the gulls that wheeled in geometric formations high overhead.
'Well, since we're waiting, you want to fill me in?'
'Harem drug.' When I looked blank, Ortega puffed out her cheeks impatiently.
She was acting like someone who hadn't slept well.
'I'm not from here.'
'You were on Sharya, you told me.'
'Yeah. In a military capacity. There wasn't all that much time for cultural
awareness. We were too busy killing people.'
This last wasn't quite true. Following the sack of Zihicce, the Envoys had been
steeped in the mechanics of engineering a regime compliant to the Protectorate.
Troublemakers were rooted out, cells of resistance infiltrated and then crushed,
collaborators plugged into the political edifice. In the process we'd learnt quite a
lot about local culture.

I'd asked for an early transfer out.
Ortega shaded her eyes and scanned the beach in both directions. Nothing
stirred. She sighed. 'It's a male response enhancer. Boosts aggression, sexual
prowess, confidence. On the street in the Middle East and Europe they call it
Stallion, in the south it's Toro. We don't get much of it here, street mood's more
ambient. Which I'm glad about. From what I hear it can be very nasty. You run
across some last night?'
'Sort of.' This was pretty much what I'd learnt from the Hendrix database last
night, but more concise and with less chemistry. And Curtis's behaviour ran the
checklist of symptoms and side effects like a model. 'Suppose I wanted to get
hold of some of this stuff, where could I pick it up. Easily, I mean.'
Ortega gave me a sharp look, and picked her way back up the beach onto dryer
sand. 'Like I said, we don't get much of it here,' she said in time with her
laboured, sinking footsteps. 'You'd have to ask around. Someone with better than
local connections. Or get it synthesised locally. But I don't know. With designer
hormones that's likely to be more expensive than just buying it in from down
south.'
She paused at the crest of the dune and looked around again.
'Where the hell is she?'
'Maybe she's not coming,' I suggested morosely. I hadn't slept all that well
myself. Most of the night after Rodrigo Bautista's departure had been spent
brooding over the uncooperatively jagged pieces of the Bancroft jigsaw and
fighting off the urge to smoke. My head seemed barely to have hit the pillow
when the Hendrix buzzed me awake with Ortega's call. It was still obscenely
early in the morning.
'She'll come,' said Ortega. 'The link's booked through to her personal pick-up.
Call's probably delayed at incoming security. We've only been in here about ten
seconds, real time.'
I shivered in the cold wind from offshore and said nothing. Overhead, the gulls
repeated their geometry. The virtuality was cheap, not designed for long stay.
'Got any cigarettes?'

I was seated in the cold sand, smoking with a kind of mechanical intensity, when
something moved on the extreme right of the bay. I straightened up and
narrowed my eyes, then laid a hand on Ortega's arm. The motion resolved itself
into a plume of sand or water, ripped into the air by a fast-moving surface
vehicle that was tearing round the curve of the beach towards us.
'Told you she'd come.'
'Or someone would,' I muttered, getting to my feet and reaching for the Nemex
which was, of course, not there. Not many virtual forums allowed firearms in
their constructs. Instead, I brushed sand from my clothes and moved down the
beach, still trying to rid myself of the brooding feeling that I was wasting my
time here.
The vehicle was close enough now to be visible, a dark dot at the front of the
pluming wake. I could hear its engine, a shrill whine over the melancholy
carping of the gulls. I turned to Ortega, who was watching the approaching craft
impassively at my side.
'Bit excessive for a phone call, isn't it?' I said nastily.
Ortega shrugged and spun her cigarette away into the sand. 'Money doesn't
automatically mean taste,' she said.
The speeding dot became a stubby, finned one-man ground jet, painted iridescent
pink. It was ploughing along through the shallow surf at the water's edge,
flinging water and wet sand indiscriminately behind it, but a few hundred metres
away the pilot must have seen us because the little craft veered out across the
deeper water and cut a spray tail twice its own height towards us.
'Pink?'
Ortega shrugged again.
The ground jet beached about ten metres away and shuddered to a halt, rippedup gobbets of wet sand splattering down around it. When the storm of its arrival
had died, a hatch was flung back and a black-clad, helmeted figure clambered
out. That the figure was a woman was abundantly clear from the form-fitting
flight suit, a suit that ended in boots inlaid with curling silver tracery from heel
to toe.

I sighed and followed Ortega up to the craft.
The woman in the flight suit jumped down into the shallow water and splashed
up to meet us, tugging at the seals on her helmet. As we met, the helmet came
off and long coppery hair spilled out over the suit's shoulders. The woman put
her head back and shook out the hair, revealing a wide-boned face with large,
expressive eyes the colour of flecked onyx, a delicately arched nose and a
generously sculpted mouth.
The old, ghostly hint of Miriam Bancroft's beauty this woman had once owned
had been scrubbed out utterly.
'Kovacs, this is Leila Begin,' said Ortega formally. 'Ms Begin, this is Takeshi
Kovacs, Laurens Bancroft's retained investigator.'
The large eyes appraised me frankly.
'You're from offworld?' she asked me.
'That's correct. Harlan's World.'
'Yes, the lieutenant mentioned it.' There was a well-designed huskiness to Leila
Begin's voice, and an accent that suggested she was unused to speaking
Amanglic. 'I can only hope that means you have an open mind.'
'Open to what?'
'The truth.' Begin gave me a surprised look. 'Lieutenant Ortega tells me you are
interested in the truth. Shall we walk?'
Without waiting for a response, she set off parallel with the surf. I exchanged a
glance with Ortega, who gestured with her thumb but showed no signs of
moving herself. I hesitated for a couple of moments, then went after Begin.
'What's all this about the truth?' I asked, catching her up.
'You have been retained to discover who killed Laurens Bancroft,' she said
intensely, without looking round. 'You wish to know the truth of what transpired
the night he died. Is this not so?'

'You don't think it was suicide, then?'
'Do you?'
'I asked first.'
I saw a faint smile cross her lips. 'No. I don't.'
'Let me guess. You're pinning it on Miriam Bancroft.'
Leila Begin stopped and turned on one of her ornate heels. 'Are you mocking
me, Mr Kovacs?'
There was something in her eyes that drained the irritable amusement out of me
on the spot. I shook my head.
'No, I'm not mocking you. But I'm right, aren't I?'
'Have you met Miriam Bancroft?'
'Briefly, yes.'
'You found her charming, no doubt.'
I shrugged evasively. 'A bit abrasive at times, but generally, yes. Charming
would do it.'
Begin looked me in the eyes. 'She is a psychopath,' she said seriously.
She resumed walking. After a moment I followed her.
'Psychopath's not a narrow term any more,' I said carefully. 'I've heard it applied
to whole cultures on occasion. It's even been applied to me once or twice.
Reality is so flexible these days, it's hard to tell who's disconnected from it and
who isn't. You might even say it's a pointless distinction.'
'Mr Kovacs.' There was an impatient note in the woman's voice now. 'Miriam
Bancroft assaulted me when I was pregnant and murdered my unborn child. She
was aware that I was pregnant. She acted with intention. Have you ever been
seven months pregnant?'

I shook my head. 'No.'
'That is too bad. It's an experience we should all be required to go through at
least once.'
'Kind of hard to legislate.'
Begin looked at me sidelong. 'In that sleeve, you look like a man acquainted with
loss, but that's the surface. Are you what you appear, Mr Kovacs? Are you
acquainted with loss? Irretrievable loss, we're discussing. Are you acquainted
with that?'
'I think so,' I said, more stiffly than I'd intended.
'Then you will understand my feelings about Miriam Bancroft. On Earth, cortical
stacks are fitted after birth.'
'Where I come from too.'
'I lost that child. No amount of technology will bring it back.'
I couldn't tell if the rising tide of emotion in Leila Begin's voice was real or
contrived, but I was losing focus. I cut back to start.
'That doesn't give Miriam Bancroft a motive for killing her husband.'
'Of course it does.' Begin favoured me with the sidelong glance again, and there
was another bitter smile on her face. 'I was not an isolated incident in Laurens
Bancroft's life. How do you think he met me?'
'In Oakland, I heard.'
The smile blossomed into a hard laugh. 'Very euphemistic. Yes, he certainly met
me in Oakland. He met me at what they used to call the Meat Rack. Not a very
classy place. Laurens needed to degrade, Mr Kovacs. That's what made him
hard. He'd been doing it for decades before me, and I don't see why he would
have stopped afterwards.'
'So Miriam decides, suddenly, enough's enough and ventilates him?'

'She's capable of it.'
'I'm sure she is.' Begin's theory was as full of holes as a captured Sharyan
deserter, but I wasn't about to elaborate the details of what I knew to this woman.
'You harbour no feelings about Bancroft himself, I suppose? Good or bad.'
The smile again. 'I was a whore, Mr Kovacs. A good one. A good whore feels
what the client wants them to feel. There's no room for anything else.'
'You telling me you can shut your feelings down just like that?'
'You telling me you can't?' she retorted.
'All right, what did Laurens Bancroft want you to feel?'
She stopped and faced me slowly. I felt uncomfortably as if I had just slapped
her. Her face had gone mask-like with remembrance.
'Animal abandonment,' she said finally. 'And then abject gratitude. And I stopped
feeling them both as soon as he stopped paying me.'
'And what do you feel now?'
'Now?' Leila Begin looked out to sea, as if testing the temperature of the breeze
against what was inside her. 'Now I feel nothing, Mr Kovacs.'
'You agreed to talk to me. You must have had a reason.'
Begin made a dismissive gesture. 'The lieutenant asked me to.'
'Very public-spirited of you.'
The woman's gaze came back to me. 'You know what happened after my
miscarriage?'
'I heard you were paid off.'
'Yes. Unpleasant-sounding, isn't it? But that's what happened. I took Bancroft's
money and I shut up. It was a lot of money. But I didn't forget where I came
from. I still get back to Oakland two or three times a year, I know the girls who
work the Rack now. Lieutenant Ortega has a good name there. Many of the girls

owe her. You might say I am paying off some favours.'
'And revenge on Miriam Bancroft doesn't come into it?'
'What revenge?' Leila Begin laughed her hard little laugh again. 'I am giving you
information because the lieutenant has asked me to. You won't be able to do
anything to Miriam Bancroft. She is a Meth. She is untouchable.'
'No one's untouchable. Not even Meths.'
Begin looked at me sadly.
'You are not from here,' she said. 'And it shows.'

Begin's call had been routed through a Caribbean linkage broker, and the virtual
time rented out of a Chinatown forum provider. Cheap, Ortega told me on the
way in, and probably as secure as anywhere. Bancroft wants privacy, he spends
half a million on discretion systems. Me, I just go talk where no one's listening.
It was also cramped. Slotted in between a pagoda-shaped bank and a steamywindowed restaurant frontage, space was at a premium. The reception area was
reached by filing up a narrow steel staircase and along a gantry pinned to one
wing of the pagoda's middle tier. A lavish seven or eight square metres of fused
sand flooring under a cheap glass viewdome provided prospective clients with a
waiting area, natural light and two pairs of seats that looked as if they had been
torn out of a decommissioned jetliner. Adjacent to the seats, an ancient Asian
woman sat behind a battery of secretarial equipment, most of which appeared to
be switched off, and guarded a flight of access steps into the bowels of the
building. Down below, it was all hairpin corridors racked with cable conduits
and piping. Each length of corridor was lined with the doors of the service
cubicles. The trode couches were set into the cubicles at a sharp upright angle to
economise on floor space and surrounded on all sides by blinking, dusty-faced
instrument panels. You strapped yourself in, traded up and then tapped the code
number given to you at reception into the arm of the couch. Then the machine
came and got your mind.
Returning from the wide open horizon of the beach virtuality was a shock.
Opening my eyes on the banks of instrumentation just above my head, I suffered

a momentary flashback to Harlan's World. Thirteen years old and waking up in a
virtual arcade after my first porn format. A low-ratio forum where two minutes
of real time got me an experiential hour and a half in the company of two
pneumatically-breasted playmates whose bodies bore more resemblance to
cartoons than real women. The scenario had been a candy-scented room of pink
cushions and fake fur rugs with windows that gave poor resolution onto a nighttime cityscape. When I started running with the gangs and making more money,
the ratio and resolution went up, and the scenarios got more imaginative, but the
thing that never changed was the stale smell and the tackiness of the trodes on
your skin when you surfaced afterwards between the cramped walls of the
coffin.
'Kovacs?'
I blinked and reached for the straps. Shouldering my way out of the cubicle, I
found Ortega already waiting in the pipe-lined corridor.
'So what do you think?'
'I think she's full of shit.' I raised my hands to forestall Ortega's outburst. 'No,
listen, I buy Miriam Bancroft as scary. I've got no argument with that. But there
are about half a hundred reasons why she doesn't fit the bill. Ortega, you
polygraphed her for fuck's sake.'
'Yeah, I know.' Ortega followed me down the corridor. 'But that's what I've been
thinking about. You know, she volunteered to take that test. I mean, it's witnessmandatory anyway, but she was demanding it practically as soon as I got to the
scene. No weeping partner shit, not even a tear, she just slammed into the
incident cruiser and asked for the wires.'
'So?'
'So I'm thinking about that stuff you pulled with Rutherford. You said if they
polygraphed you while you were doing that, you wouldn't register, now — '
'Ortega, that's Envoy conditioning. Pure mind discipline. It's not physical. You
can't buy stuff like that off the rack at SleeveMart.'
'Miriam Bancroft wears state-of-the-art Nakamura. They use her face and body
to sell the stuff — '

'Do Nakamura do something that'll beat a police polygraph?'
'Not officially.'
'Well there you — '
'Don't be so fucking obtuse. You never heard of custom biochem?'
I paused at the foot of the stairs up to reception and shook my head. 'I don't buy
it. Torch her husband with a weapon only she and he have access to. No one's
that stupid.'
We went upstairs, Ortega at my heels.
'Think about it, Kovacs. I'm not saying it was premeditated — '
'And what about the remote storage? It was a pointless crime — '
' — not saying it was even rational, but you've got to — '
' — got to be someone who didn't know —
'Fuck! Kovacs!'
Ortega's voice, up a full octave.
We were into the reception zone by now. Still two clients waiting on the left, a
man and a woman deep in discussion of a large paper-wrapped package. On the
right a peripheral flicker of crimson where there should have been none. I was
looking at blood.
The ancient Asian receptionist was dead, throat cut with something that glinted
metallic deep within the wound around her neck. Her head rested in a shiny pool
of her own blood on the desk in front of her.
My hand leapt for the Nemex. Beside me, I heard the snap as Ortega chambered
the first slug in her Smith & Wesson. I swung towards the two waiting clients
and their paper-wrapped package.
Time turned dreamlike. The neurachem made everything impossibly slow,
separate images drifting to the floor of my vision like autumn leaves.

The package had fallen apart. The woman was holding a compact Sunjet, the
man a machine pistol. I cleared the Nemex and started firing from the hip.
The door to the gantry burst open and another figure stood in the opening,
brandishing a pistol in each fist.
Beside me, Ortega's Smith & Wesson boomed and blew the new arrival back
through the door like a reversed film sequence of his entrance.
My first shot ruptured the headrest of the woman's seat, showering her with
white padding. The Sunjet sizzled, the beam went wide. The second slug
exploded her head and turned the drifting white flecks red.
Ortega yelled in fury. She was still firing, upward my peripheral sense told me.
Somewhere above us, her shots splintered glass.
The machine gunner had struggled to his feet. I registered the bland features of a
synth and put a pair of slugs into him. He staggered back against the wall, still
raising the gun. I dived for the floor.
The dome above our heads smashed inward. Ortega yelled something and I
rolled sideways. A body tumbled bonelessly head over feet onto the ground next
to me.
The machine pistol cut loose, aimless. Ortega yelled again and flattened herself
on the floor. I rolled upright on the lap of the dead woman and shot the synthetic
again, three times in rapid succession. The gunfire choked off.
Silence.
I swung the Nemex left and right, covering the corners of the room and the front
door. The jagged edges of the smashed dome above. Nothing.
'Ortega?'
'Yeah, fine.' She was sprawled on the other side of the room, propping herself up
on one elbow. There was a tightness in her voice that belied her words. I swayed
to my feet and made my way across to her, footsteps crunching on broken glass.
'Where's it hurt?' I demanded, crouching to help her sit up.

'Shoulder. Fucking bitch got me with the Sunjet.'
I stowed the Nemex and looked at the wound. The beam had carved a long
diagonal furrow across the back of Ortega's jacket and clipped through the left
shoulder pad at the top. The meat beneath the pad was cooked, seared down to
the bone in a narrow line at the centre.
'Lucky,' I said with forced lightness. 'You hadn't ducked, it would have been your
head.'
'I wasn't ducking, I was fucking falling over.'
'Good enough. You want to stand up?'
'What do you think?' Ortega levered herself to her knees on her uninjured arm
and then stood. She grimaced at the movement of her jacket against the wound.
'Fuck, that stings.'
'I think that's what the guy in the doorway said.'
Leaning on me, she turned to stare, eyes centimetres away. I deadpanned it, and
the laughter broke across her face like a sunrise. She shook her head.
'Jesus, Kovacs, you are one sick motherfucker. They teach you to tell postfirefight jokes in the Corps or is it just you?'
I guided her towards the exit. 'Just me. Come on, let's get you some fresh air.'
Behind us, there was a sudden flailing sound. I jerked around and saw the
synthetic sleeve staggering upright. Its head was smashed and disfigured where
my last shot had torn the side of the skull off, and the gun hand was spasmed
open at the end of a stiff, blood-streaked right arm, but the other arm was
flexing, hand curling into a fist. The synth stumbled against the chair, righted
itself and came towards us, dragging its right leg.
I drew the Nemex and pointed it.
'Fight's over,' I advised.
The slack face grinned at me. Another halting step. I frowned.

'For Christ's sake, Kovacs,' Ortega was fumbling for her own weapon. 'Get it
over with.'
I snapped off a shot and the shell punched the synth backwards onto the glassstrewn floor. It twisted a couple of times, then lay still but breathing sluggishly.
As I watched it, fascinated, a gurgling laugh arose from its mouth.
'That's fucking enough,' it coughed, and laughed again. 'Eh, Kovacs? That's
fucking enough.'
The words held me in shock for the space of a heartbeat, then I wheeled and
made for the door, dragging Ortega with me.
'Wha — '
'Out. Get the fuck out.' I thrust her through the door ahead of me and grabbed the
railing outside. The dead pistoleer lay twisted on the walkway ahead. I shoved
Ortega again and she vaulted the body awkwardly. Slamming the door after me, I
followed her at a run.
We were almost to the end of the gantry when the dome behind us detonated in a
geyser of glass and steel. I distinctly heard the door come off its hinges behind
us, and then the blast picked us both up like discarded coats and threw us down
the stairs into the street.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

The police are more impressive by night.
First of all you've got the flashing lights casting dramatic colour into everyone's
faces, grim expressions steeped alternately in criminal red and smoky blue. Then
there's the sound of the sirens on the night, like an elevator ratcheting down the
levels of the city, the crackling voices of the comsets, somehow brisk and
mysterious at the same time, the coming and going of dimly lit bulky figures and
snatches of cryptic conversation, the deployed technology of law enforcement
for wakened bystanders to gape at, the lack of anything else going on to provide
a vacuum backdrop. There can be absolutely nothing to see beyond this and
people will still watch for hours.
Nine o'clock on a workday morning it's a different matter. A couple of cruisers
turned up in response to Ortega's call in but their lights and sirens were barely
noticeable above the general racket of the city. The uniformed crews strung
incident barriers at either end of the street and shepherded customers out of the
neighbouring businesses, while Ortega persuaded the bank's private security not
to arrest me as a possible accessory to the bombing. There was a bounty on
terrorists, apparently. A crowd of sorts developed beyond the almost invisible
hazing of the barriers, but it seemed mostly composed of irate pedestrians trying
to get past.
I sat the whole thing out on the kerb opposite, checking over the superficial

injuries I'd acquired on my short flight down from the gantry to the street.
Mostly, it was bruising and abrasions. The shape of the forum provider's reception area had channelled most of the blast directly upwards through the roof and
that was the route the bulk of the shrapnel had taken as well. We'd been very
lucky.
Ortega left the clutch of uniformed officers gathered outside the bank and strode
across to the street towards me. She had removed her jacket and there was a long
white smear of tissue weld congealing over her shoulder wound. She held her
discarded shoulder holster dangling in one hand and her breasts moved beneath
the thin cotton of a white T-shirt that bore the legend You Have The Right To
Remain Silent — Why Don't You Try It For A While? She seated herself next to
me on the kerb.
'Forensic wagon's on the way,' she said inconsequentially. 'You reckon we'll get
anything useful out of the wreckage?'
I looked at the smouldering ruin of the dome and shook my head.
'There'll be bodies, maybe even stacks intact, but those guys were just local
street muscle. All they'll tell you is that the synth hired them, probably for half a
dozen ampoules of tetrameth each.'
'Yeah, they were kind of sloppy, weren't they?'
I felt a smile ghost across my lips. 'Kind of. But then I don't think they were even
supposed to get us.'
'Just keep us busy till your pal blew up, huh?'
'Something like that.'
'The way I figure it, the detonator was wired into his vital signs, right? You snuff
him and boom, he takes you with him. Me too. And the cheap hired help.'
'And wipes out his own stack and sleeve.' I nodded. 'Tidy, isn't it?'
'So what went wrong?'
I rubbed absently at the scar under my eye. 'He overestimated me. I was

supposed to kill him outright, but I missed. Probably would have killed himself
at: that stage, but I messed up his arm trying to stop the machine pistol.' In my
mind's eye the gun drops from splayed fingers and skitters across the floor. 'Blew
it way out of his reach as well. He must have been lying there, willing himself to
die when he heard us leaving. Wonder what make of synth he was using.'
'Whoever it was, they can have an endorsement from me any day of the week,'
said Ortega cheerfully. 'Maybe there'll be something left for forensics after all.'
'You know who it was, don't you?'
'He called you Kov — '
'It was Kadmin.'
There was a short silence. I watched the smoke curling up from the ruined dome.
Ortega breathed in, out.
'Kadmin's in the store.'
'Not any more he isn't.' I glanced sideways at her. 'You got a cigarette?'
She passed me the packet wordlessly. I shook one out, fitted it into the corner of
my mouth, touched the ignition patch to the end and drew deeply. The
movements happened as one, reflex conditioned over years like a macro of need.
I didn't have to consciously do anything. The smoke curling into my lungs was
like a breath of the perfume you remember an old lover wearing.
'He knew me.' I exhaled. 'And he knew his Quellist history too. "That's fucking
enough" is what a Quellist guerrilla called Iffy Deme said when she died under
interrogation during the Unsettlement on Harlan's World. She was wired with
internal explosives and she brought the house down. Sound familiar? Now who
do we know who can swap Quell quotes like a Millsport native?'
'He's in the fucking store, Kovacs. You can't get someone out of the store without
—'
'Without an AI. With an AI, you can do it. I've seen it done. Core command on
Adoracion did it with our prisoners of war, like that.' I snapped my fingers. 'Like
hooking elephant rays off a spawning reef.'

'As easy as that?' Ortega said ironically.
I sucked down some more smoke and ignored her. 'You remember when we were
in virtual with Kadmin, we got that lightning effect across the sky?'
'Didn't see it. No, wait, yeah. I thought it was a glitch.'
'It wasn't. It touched him. Reflected in the table. That's when he promised to kill
me.' I turned towards her and grinned queasily. The memory of Kadmin's virtual
entity was clear and monstrous. 'You want to hear a genuine first generation
Harlan's World myth? An offworld fairy story?'
'Kovacs, even with an AI, they'd need — '
'Want to hear the story?'
Ortega shrugged, winced and nodded. 'Sure. Can I have my cigarettes back?'
I tossed her the pack and waited while she kindled the cigarette. She plumed
smoke out across the street. 'Go on, then.'
'Right. Where I come from originally, Newpest, used to be a textile town. There's
a plant on Harlan's World called belaweed, grows in the sea and on most
shorelines too. Dry it out, treat it with chemicals and you can make something
like cotton from it. During the Settlement Newpest was the belacotton capital of
the World. Conditions in the mills were pretty bad even back then, and when the
Quellists turned everything upside down it got worse. The belacotton industry
went into decline and there was massive unemployment, unrelieved poverty and
fuck all the Unsettlers could do about it. They were revolutionaries, not
economists.'
'Same old song, huh?'
'Well, familiar tune anyway. Some pretty horrible stories came out of the textile
slums around that time. Stuff like the Threshing Sprites, the Cannibal of Kitano
Street.'
Ortega drew on her cigarette and widened her eyes. 'Charming.'
'Yeah, well, bad times. So you get the story of Mad Ludmila the seamstress. This

is one they used to tell to kids to make them do their chores and come home
before dark. Mad Ludmila had a failing belacotton mill and three children who
never helped her out. They used to stay out late, playing the arcades across town
and sleep all day. So one day, the story goes, Ludmila flips out.'
'She wasn't already mad, then?'
'No, just a bit stressed.'
'You called her Mad Ludmila.'
'That's what the story's called.'
'But if she wasn't mad at the beginning — '
'Do you want to hear this story or not?'
Ortega's mouth quirked at the corner. She waved me on with her cigarette.
'The story goes, one evening as her children were getting ready to go out, she
spiked their coffee with something and when they were semi-conscious, but still
aware, mind you, she drove them out to Mitcham's Point and threw them into the
threshing tanks one by one. They say you could hear the screams right across the
swamp.'
'Mh-mmmm.'
'Of course, the police were suspicious — '
'Really?'
' — but they couldn't prove anything. Couple of the kids had been into some
nasty chemicals, they were jerking around with the local yakuza, no one was
really surprised when they disappeared.'
'Is there a point to this story?'
'Yeah. See, Ludmila got rid of her fucking useless children, but it didn't really
help. She still needed someone to man the curing vats, to haul the belaweed up
and down the mill stairs, and she was still broke. So what did she do?'

'Something gory, I imagine.'
I nodded. 'What she did, she picked the bits of her mangled kids out of the
thresher and stitched them into a huge three-metre-tall carcass. And then, on a
night sacred to the dark powers, she invoked a Tengu to — '
'A what?'
'A Tengu. It's a sort of mischief-maker, a demon I guess you'd call it. She
invoked the Tengu to animate the carcass, and then she stitched it in.'
'What, when it wasn't looking?'
'Ortega, it's a fairy story. She stitched the soul of the Tengu inside, but she
promised to release it if it served her will nine years. Nine's a sacred number in
the Harlanite pantheons, so she was as bound to the agreement as the Tengu.
Unfortunately — '
'Ah.'
' — Tengu are not known for their patience, and I don't suppose old Ludmila was
the easiest person to work for either. One night, not a third of the way through
the contract, the Tengu turned on her and tore her apart. Some say it was
Kishimo-jin's doing, that she whispered terrible incitements into the Tengu's ear
at — '
'Kishimo Gin?'
'Kishimo-jin, the divine protectress of children. It was her revenge on Ludmila
for the death of the children. That's one version, there's another that — ' I picked
up Ortega's mutinous expression out of the corner of my eye and hurried on.
'Well, anyway, the Tengu tore her apart, but in so doing it locked itself into the
spell and was condemned to remain imprisoned in the carcass. And now, with
the original invoker of the spell dead, and worse still, betrayed, the carcass began
to rot. A piece here, a piece there, but irreversibly. And so the Tengu was driven
to prowling the streets and mills of the textile quarter, looking for fresh meat to
replace the rotting portions of its body. It always killed children, because the
parts it needed to replace were child-sized, but however many times it sewed
new flesh to the carcass — '

'I''d learnt to sew, then?'
'Tengu are multi-talented. However many times it replaced itself, after a few
days the new portions began to putrefy, and it was driven out once more to hunt.
In the quarter they call it the Patchwork Man.'
I fell silent. Ortega mouthed a silent O, then slowly exhaled smoke through it.
She watched the smoke dissipate, then turned to face me.
'Your mother tell you that story?'
'Father. When I was five.'
She looked at the end of her cigarette. 'Nice.'
'No. He wasn't. But that's another story.' I stood up and looked down the street to
where the crowd was massed at one of the incident barriers. 'Kadmin's out there,
and he's out of control. Whoever he was working for, he's working for himself
now.'
'How?' Ortega spread her hands in exasperation. 'OK, an AI could tunnel into the
Bay City PD stack. I'll buy that. But we're talking about microsecond intrusion
here. Any longer and it'd ring bells from here to Sacramento.'
'Microsecond's all it needed.'
'But Kadmin isn't on stack. They'd need to know when he was being spun, and
they'd need a fix. They'd need . . . '
She stopped as she saw it coming.
'Me.' I finished for her. 'They'd need me.'
'But you — '
'I'm going to need some time to sort this out, Ortega.' I spun my cigarette into the
gutter and grimaced as I tasted the inside of my own mouth. 'Today, maybe
tomorrow too. Check the stack. Kadmin's gone. If I were you, I'd keep your head
down for a while.'

Ortega pulled a sour face. 'You telling me to go undercover in my own city?'
'Not telling you to do anything.' I pulled out the Nemex and ejected the halfspent magazine with actions almost as automatic as the smoking had been. The
clip went into my jacket pocket. 'I'm giving you the state of play. We'll need
somewhere to meet. Not the Hendrix. And not anywhere you can be traced to
either. Don't tell me, just write it down.' I nodded at the crowd beyond the
barriers. 'Anybody down there with decent implants could have this conversation
focused and amped.'
'Jesus.' She blew out her cheeks. 'That's technoparanoia, Kovacs.'
'Don't tell me that. I used to do this for a living.'
She thought about it for a moment, then produced a pen and scribbled on the side
of the cigarette packet. I fished a fresh magazine from my pocket and jacked it
into the Nemex, eyes still scanning the crowd.
'There you go.' Ortega tossed me the packet. 'That's a discreet destination code.
Feed it to any taxi in the Bay area and it'll take you there. I'll be there tonight,
tomorrow night. After that, it's back to business as usual.'
I caught the packet left-handed, glanced briefly at the numbers and put it away in
my jacket. Then I snapped the slide on the Nemex to chamber the first slug and
stuffed the pistol back into its holster.
'Tell me that when you've checked the stack,' I said, and started walking.

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

I walked south.
Over my head, autocabs wove in and out of the traffic with programmed hyperefficiency and swooped occasionally to ground level in attempts to stimulate
custom. The weather above the traffic flow was on the change, grey cloud cover
racing in from the west and occasional spots of rain hitting my cheek when I
looked up. I left the cabs alone. Go primitive, Virginia Vidaura would have said.
With an AI gunning for you, your only hope is to drop out of the electronic
plane. Of course, on a battlefield that's a lot more easily done. Plenty of mud and
chaos to hide in. A modern city — unbombed — is a logistical nightmare for this
kind of evasion. Every building, every vehicle, every street is jacked into the
web, and every transaction you make tags you for the datahounds.
I found a battered-looking currency dispenser and replenished my thinning sheaf
of plastified notes from it. Then I backed up two blocks and went east until I
found a public callbox. I searched through my pockets, came up with a card,
settled the call trades on my head and dialled.
There was no image. No sound of connection. This was an internal chip. The
voice spoke brusquely out of a blank screen.
'Who is this?'
'You gave me your card,' I said, 'in case of anything major. Well, now it seems

there's something pretty fucking major we need to talk about, doctor.'
There was an audible click as she swallowed, just once, and then her voice was
there again, level and cool. 'We should meet. I assume you don't want to come to
the facility.'
'You assume right. You know the red bridge?'
'The Golden Gate, it's called,' she said dryly. 'Yes, I'm familiar with it.'
'Be there at eleven. Northbound carriageway. Come alone.'
I cut the connection. Dialled again.
'Bancroft residence, with whom do you wish to speak?' A severely-suited woman
with a hairstyle reminiscent of Angin Chandra's pilot cuts arrived on the screen a
fraction after she started speaking.
'Lauirens Bancroft, please.'
'Mr Bancroft is in conference at present.'
That made it even easier. 'Fine. When he's available, can you tell him Takeshi
Kovacs called.'
'Would you like to speak to Mrs Bancroft? She has left instructions that —
'No,' I said rapidly. 'That won't be necessary. Please tell Mr Bancroft that I shall
be out of contact for a few days, but that I will call him from Seattle. That's all.'
I cut the connection, and checked my watch. There was about an hour and forty
minutes left of the time I'd given myself to be on the bridge. I went looking for a
bar.
I'm stacked, backed up and I'm fifth dan
And I'm not afraid of the Patchwork Man

The small coin of urchin rhyme gleamed up at me from the silted bed of my

childhood.
But I was afraid.

The rain still hadn't set in when we got onto the approach road to the bridge, but
the clouds were massing sullenly above and the windscreen was splattered with
heavy droplets too few to trigger the truck's wipers. I watched the rust-coloured
structure looming up ahead through the distortion of the exploded raindrops and
knew I was going to get soaked.
There was no traffic on the bridge. The suspension towers rose like the bones of
some incalculably huge dinosaur above deserted asphalt lanes and side gantries
lined with unidentifiable detritus.
'Slow down,' I told my companion as we passed under the first tower, and the
heavy vehicle braked with uncalled for force. I glanced sideways. 'Take it easy. I
told you, this is a no-risk gig. I'm just meeting someone.'
Graft Nicholson gave me a bleary look from the driver's seat, and a breath of
stale alcohol came with it.
'Yeah, sure. You hand out this much plastique on drivers every week, right? Just
pick them out of Licktown bars for charity?'
I shrugged. 'Believe what you want. Just keep your speed down. You can drive
as fast as you like after you let me out.'
Nicholson shook his tangled head. 'This is fucked, man — '
'There. Standing on the walkway. Drop me there.' There was a solitary figure
leaning on the rail up ahead, apparently contemplating the view of the bay.
Nicholson frowned with concentration and hunched the vastly out-sized
shoulders for which, presumably, he was named. The battered truck drifted
sedately but not quite smoothly across two lanes and came to a bumpy halt
beside the right-hand barrier.
I jumped down, glanced around for bystanders, saw none and pulled myself back
up on the open door.

'All right now, listen. It's going to be at least two days till I get to Seattle, maybe
three, so you just hole up in the first hotel the city limits datastack has to offer,
and you wait for me there. Pay cash, but book in under my name. I'll contact you
between ten and eleven in the morning, so be in the hotel at those times. The rest
of the time, you can do what you like. I figure I gave you enough cash not to get
bored.'
Graft Nicholson bared his teeth in a knowing leer that made me feel slightly
sorry for anyone working in the Seattle leisure industry that week. 'Don't worry
'bout me, man. Old Graft knows how to grab a good time by the titties.'
'I'm glad. Just don't get too comfortable. We may need to move it in a hurry.'
'Yeah, yeah. What about the rest of the plastique, man?'
'I told you. You'll get paid when we're done.'
'And what about if you don't show up in three days?'
'In that case,' I said pleasantly, 'I'll be dead. That happens, it'd be better to drop
out of sight for a few weeks. They're not going to waste time looking for you.
They find me, they'll be happy.'
'Man, I don't think I'm — '
'You'll be fine. See you in three days.' I dropped back to the ground, slammed the
truck door and banged on it twice. The engine rumbled into drive and Nicholson
pulled the truck back out into the middle of the carriageway.
Watching him go, I wondered briefly if he'd actually go to Seattle at all. I'd given
him a sizable chunk of credit, after all, and even with the promise of a second
down payment if he followed instructions, the temptation would still be to
double back somewhere up the coast and head straight back to the bar I'd picked
him out of. Or he might get jumpy, sitting in the hotel waiting for a knock on the
door, and skip before the three days were up. I couldn't really blame him for
these potential betrayals, since I had no intention of turning up myself. Whatever
he did was fine by me.
In systems evasion, you must scramble the enemy's assumptions, said Virginia in
my ear. Run as much interference as you can without breaking pace.

'A friend of yours, Mr Kovacs?' The doctor had come to the barrier and was
watching the car recede.
'Met him in a bar,' I said truthfully, climbing over to her side, and making for the
rail. It was the same view I'd seen when Curtis brought me back from Suntouch
House the day of my arrival. In the gloomy, pre-rain light the aerial traffic
glimmered above the buildings across the Bay like a swarm of fireflies.
Narrowing my eyes, I could make out detail on the island of Alcatraz, the greywalled and orange-windowed bunker of PsychaSec SA. Beyond lay Oakland. At
my back, the open sea and to north and south a solid kilometre of empty bridge.
Reasonably sure that nothing short of tactical artillery could surprise me here, I
turned back to look at the doctor.
She seemed to flinch as my gaze fell on her.
'What's the matter?' I asked softly. 'Medical ethics pinching a little?'
'It was not my idea — '
'I know that. You just signed the releases, turned a blind eye, that kind of thing.
So who was it?'
'I don't know,' she said not quite steadily. 'Someone came to see Sullivan. An
artificial sleeve. Asian, I think.'
I nodded. Trepp.
'What were Sullivan's instructions?'
'Virtual net locater, fitted between the cortical stack and neural interface.' The
clinical details seemed to give her strength. Her voice firmed up. 'We did the
surgery two days before you were freighted. Microscalpelled into the vertebrae
along the line of the original stack incision, and plugged it with graft tissue. No
show under any kind of sweep outside virtual. You'd have to run a full neuroelectrical to find it. How did you guess?'
'I didn't have to guess. Someone used it to locate and lever a contract killer out of
the Bay City police holding stack. That's Aiding and Abetting. You and Sullivan
are both going down for a couple of decades minimum.'

She looked pointedly up and down the empty bridge. 'In that case, why aren't the
police here, Mr Kovacs?'
I thought about the rap sheet and military records that must have come to earth
with me, and what it must feel like standing here alone with someone who had
done all those things. What it must have taken to come out here alone. Slowly, a
reluctant smile crept out of one corner of my mouth.
'All right, I'm impressed,' I said. 'Now tell me how to neutralise the damn thing.'
She looked at me seriously, and the rain began to fall. Heavy drops, dampening
the shoulders of her coat. I felt it in my hair. We both glanced up and I cursed. A
moment later she stepped closer to me and touched a heavy brooch on one wing
of her coat. The air above us shimmered and the rain stopped falling on me.
Looking up again, I saw it exploding off the dome of the repulsion field over our
heads. Around our feet, the paving darkened in splotches and then uniformly, but
a magic circle around our feet stayed dry.
'To actually remove the locater will require microsurgery similar to its
placement. It can be done, but not without a full micro-op theatre. Anything less,
and you run the risk of damaging the neural interface, or even the spinal nerve
canals.'
I shifted a little, uncomfortable at our proximity. 'Yeah, I figured.'
'Well, then you've probably also figured,' she said, burlesquing my accent, 'that
you can enter either a scrambling signal or a mirror code into the stack receiver
to neutralise the broadcast signature.'
'If you've got the original signature.'
'If, as you say, you have the original signature.' She reached into her pocket and
produced a small, plastic-sheathed disc, weighed it in her palm for a moment and
then held it out to me. 'Well, now you have.'
I took the disc and looked at it speculatively.
'It's genuine. Any neuro-electrical clinic will confirm that for you. If you have
doubts, I can recommend — '

'Why are you doing this for me?'
She met my eye, without flinching this time. 'I'm not doing it for you, Mr
Kovacs. I am doing this for myself
I waited. She looked away for a moment, across the Bay. 'I am not a stranger to
corruption, Mr Kovacs. No one can work for long in a justice facility and fail to
recognise a gangster. The synthetic was one of a type. Warden Sullivan has had
dealings with these people as long as I have had tenure at Bay City. Police
jurisdiction ends outside our doors, and Administration salaries are not high.'
She looked back at me. 'I have never taken payment from these people, nor, until
now, had I acted on their behalf. But equally, I have never stood against them. It
has been very easy to bury myself in my work and pretend not to see what goes
on.'
' "The human eye is a wonderful device," ' I quoted from Poems and Other
Prevarications absently. ' "With a little effort, it can fail to see even the most
glaring injustice." '
'Very aptly put.'
'It's not mine. So how come you did the surgery?'
She nodded. 'As I said, until now I had managed to avoid actual contact with
these people. Sullivan had me assigned to Offworld Sleeving because there
wasn't much of it, and the favours he did were all local. It made it easier for both
of us. He's a good manager in that respect.'
'Shame I came along then.'
'Yes, it presented a problem. He knew it'd look odd if I was taken off the
procedure for one of his more compliant medics, and he didn't want any waves.
Apparently this was something big.' She placed the same derisive stress on the
words as she had on my figured earlier. 'These people were jacked in at high
level, and everything had to be smooth. But he wasn't stupid, he had a rationale
all ready for me.'
'Which was?'

She gave me another candid look. 'That you were a dangerous psychopath. A
killing machine turned rabid. And that, whatever the reasons, it wouldn't be a
good idea to have you swimming the dataflows untagged. No telling where you
could needlecast to once you're out of the real world. And I bought it. He
showed me the files they have on you. Oh, he wasn't stupid. No. I was.'
I thought of Leila Begin and our talk of psychopaths on the virtual beach. Of my
own flippant responses.
'Sullivan wouldn't be the first person to call me a psychopath. And you wouldn't
be the first person to buy it either. The Envoys, well, it's . . . ' I shrugged and
looked away. 'It's a label. Simplification for public consumption.'
'They say a lot of you turned. That twenty per cent of the serious crime in the
Protectorate is caused by renegade Envoys. Is it true?'
'The percentage?' I stared away through the rain. 'I wouldn't know. There are a
lot of us out there, yes. There's not much else to do once you've been discharged
from the Corps. They won't let you into anything that might lead to a position of
power or influence. On most worlds you're barred from holding public office.
Nobody trusts Envoys, and that means no promotion. No prospects. No loans, no
credit.'
I turned back to her. 'And the stuff we've been trained to do is so close to crime,
there's almost no difference. Except: that crime is easier. Most criminals are
stupid, you probably know that. Even the organised syndicates are like kid gangs
compared to the Corps. It's easy to get respect. And when you've spent the last
decade of your life jacking in and out of sleeves, cooling out on stack and living
virtual, the threats that law enforcement has to offer are pretty bland.'
We stood together in silence for a while.
'I'm sorry,' she said finally.
'Don't be. Anyone reading those files on me would have — '
'That isn't what I meant.'
'Oh.' I looked down at the disc in my hands. 'Well, if you were looking to atone
for something, I'd say you just have. And take it from me, no one stays totally

clean. The only place you get to do that is on stack.'
'Yes. I know.'
'Yeah, well. There is just one more thing I'd like to know.'
'Yes?'
'Is Sullivan at Bay City Central right now?'
'He was when I went out.'
'And what time is he likely to leave this evening?'
'It's usually around seven.' She compressed her lips. 'What are you going to do?'
'I'm going to ask him some questions,' I said truthfully.
'And if he won't answer them?'
'Like you said, he's not stupid.' I put the disc into my jacket pocket. 'Thank you
for your help, doctor. I'd suggest you try not to be around the facility at seven
tonight. And thank you.'
'As I said Mr Kovacs, I am doing this for myself.'
'That's not what I meant, doctor.'
'Oh.'
I placed one hand lightly on her arm, then stepped away from her and so back
out into the rain.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

The wood of the bench had been worn by decades of occupants into a series of
comfortable, buttock-shaped depressions, and the arms were similarly sculpted. I
moulded myself lengthwise into the curves, cocked my boots on the bench end
nearest the doors I was watching, and settled down to read the graffiti etched into
the wood. I was soaked from the long walk back across town, but the hall was
pleasantly heated and the rain rattled impotently on the long transparent panels
of the tilted roof high above my head. After a while, one of the dog-sized
cleaning robots came to wipe away my muddy footprints from the fused glass
paving. I watched it idly until the job was done and the record of my arrival on
the bench was totally erased.
It would have been nice to think my electronic traces could be wiped in the same
way, but that kind of escape belonged to the legendary heroes of another age.
The cleaning robot trundled off and I went back to the graffiti. Most of it was
Amanglic or Spanish, old jokes that I'd seen before in a hundred similar places;
Cabron Modificado! and Absent without Sleeve!, the old crack The Altered
Native Was Here!, but high on the bench's backrest and chiselled upside down,
like a tiny pool of inverted calm in all the rage and desperate pride, I found a
curious haiku in Kanji:
Pull on the new flesh like borrowed gloves

And burn your fingers once again.

The author must have been leaning over the back of the bench when he cut it
into the wood, but still each character was executed with elegant care. I gazed at
the calligraphy for what was probably a long time, while memories of Harlan's
World sang in my head like high-tension cables.
A sudden burst of crying over to my right jolted me out of the reverie. A young
black woman and her two children, also black, were staring at the stooped,
middle-aged white man standing before them in tattered UN surplus fatigues.
Family reunion. The young woman's face was a mask of shock, it hadn't hit her
properly yet, and the smaller child, probably no more than four, just didn't get it
at all. She was looking right through the white man, mouth forming the repeated
question Where's Daddy? Where's Daddy? The man's features were glistening in
the rainy light from the roof — he looked like he'd been crying since they
dragged him out of the tank.
I rolled my head to an empty quadrant of the hall. My own father had walked
right past his waiting family and out of our lives when he was re-sleeved. We
never even knew which one he was, although I sometimes wonder if my mother
didn't catch some splinter of recognition in an averted gaze, some echo of stance
or gait as he passed. I don't know if he was too ashamed to confront us, or more
likely too set up with the luck of drawing a sleeve sounder than his own alcoholwrecked body had been, and already plotting a new course for other cities and
younger women. I was ten at the time. The first I knew about it was when the
attendants ushered us out of the facility just short of locking up for the night.
We'd been there since noon.
The chief attendant was an old man, conciliatory and very good with kids. He
put his hand on my shoulder and spoke kindly to me before leading us out. To
my mother, he made a short bow and murmured something formal that allowed
her to keep the dam of her self-control intact.
He probably saw a few like us every week.
I memorised Ortega's discreet destination code, for something to do with my
mind, then shredded that panel of the cigarette packet and ate it.

My clothes were almost dried through by the time Sullivan came through the
doors leading out of the facility and started down the steps. His thin frame was
cloaked in a long grey raincoat, and he wore a brimmed hat, something I hadn't
seen so far in Bay City. Framed in the V between my propped feet and reeled
into close-up with the neurachem, his face looked pale and tired. I shifted a little
on the bench and brushed the bolstered Philips gun with the tips of my fingers.
Sullivan was coming straight towards me, but when he saw my form sprawled
on the bench he pursed his mouth with disapproval and altered course to avoid
what he presumably took for a derelict cluttering up the facility. He passed
without giving me another glance.
I gave him a few metres start and then swung silently to my feet and went after
him, slipping the Philips gun out of its holster under my coat. I caught up just as
he reached the exit. As the doors parted for him, I shoved him rudely in the small
of the back and stepped quickly outside in his wake. He was swinging back to
face me, features contorted with anger, as the doors started to close.
'What do you think you're — ' The rest of it died on his lips as he saw who I was.
'Warden Sullivan,' I said affably, and showed him the Philips gun under my
jacket. 'This is a silent weapon, and I'm not in a good mood. Please do exactly as
I tell you.'
He swallowed. 'What do you want?'
'I want to talk about Trepp, among others. And I don't want to do it in the rain.
Let's go.'
'My car is — '
'A really bad idea.' I nodded. 'So let's walk. And Warden Sullivan, if you so
much as blink at the wrong person, I'll shoot you in half. You won't see the gun,
no one will. But it'll be there just the same.'
'You're making a mistake, Kovacs.'
'I don't think so.' I tipped my head towards the diminished ranks of parked
vehicles in the lot. 'Straight through, and left into the street. Keep going till I tell
you to stop.'

Sullivan started to say something else, but I jerked the barrel of the Philips gun
at him and he shut up. Sideways at first, he made his way down the steps to the
parking lot and then, with occasional backward glances, across the uneven
ground towards the sagging double gate that had rusted open on its runners what
looked like centuries ago.
'Eyes front,' I called across the widening gap between us. 'I'm still back here, you
don't need to worry about that.'
Out on the street, I let the gap grow to about a dozen metres and pretended
complete dissociation from the figure ahead of me. It wasn't a great
neighbourhood and there weren't many people out walking in the rain. Sullivan
was an easy target for the Philips gun at double the distance.
Five blocks on, I spotted the steamed-up windows of the noodle house I was
looking for. I quickened my pace and came up on Sullivan's streetside shoulder.
'In here. Go to the booths at the back and sit down.'
I made a single sweep of the street, saw no one obvious, and followed Sullivan
inside.
The place was almost empty, the daytime diners long departed and the evening
not yet cranked up. Two ancient Chinese women sat in a corner with the
withered elegance of dried bouquets, heads nodding together. On the other side
of the restaurant four young men in pale silk suits lounged dangerously and
toyed with expensive-looking chunks of hardware. At a table near one of the
windows, a fat Caucasian was working his way through an enormous bowl of
chow mein and simultaneously flicking over the pages of a holoporn comic. A
video screen set high on one wall gave out coverage of some incomprehensible
local sport.
'Tea,' I said to the young waiter who came to meet us, and seated myself opposite
Sullivan in the booth.
'You aren't going to get away with this,' he said unconvincingly. 'Even if you kill
me, really kill me, they'll check the most recent re-sleevings and backtrack to
you sooner or later.'
'Yeah, maybe they'll even find out about the unofficial surgery this sleeve had

before I arrived.'
'That bitch. She's going to — '
'You're in no position to be making threats,' I said mildly. 'In fact you're in no
position to do anything except answer my questions and hope I believe you.
Who told you to tag me?'
Silence, apart from the game coverage from the set on the wall. Sullivan stared
sullenly at me.
'All right, I'll make it easy for you. Simple yes or no. An artificial called Trepp
came to see you. Was this the first time you'd had dealings with her?'
'I don't know what you're talking about.'
With measured anger, I backhanded him hard across the mouth. He collapsed
sideways against the wall of the booth, losing his hat. The conversation of the
young men in silk stopped abruptly, then resumed with great animation as I cut
them a sideways glance. The two old women got stiffly to their feet and filed out
through a back entrance. The Caucasian didn't even look up from his holoporn. I
leaned across the table.
'Warden Sullivan, you're not taking this in the spirit it's intended. I am very
concerned to know who you sold me to. I'm not going to go away, just because
you have some residual scruples about client confidentiality. Believe me, they
didn't pay you enough to hold out on me.'
Sullivan sat back up, wiping at the blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.
To his credit, he managed a bitter smile with the undamaged portion of his lips.
'You think I haven't been threatened before, Kovacs?'
I examined the hand I'd hit him with. 'I think you've had very little experience of
personal violence, and that's going to be a disadvantage. I'm going to give you
the chance to tell me what I want to know here and now. After that we go
somewhere with soundproofing. Now, who sent Trepp?'
'You're a thug, Kovacs. Nothing but — '

I snapped folded knuckles across the table and into his left eye. It made less
noise than the slap. Sullivan grunted in shock and reeled away from the blow,
cowering into the seat. I watched impassively until he recovered. Something
cold was rising in me, something born on the benches of the Newpest justice
facility and tempered with the years of pointless unpleasantness I had been
witness to. I hoped Sullivan wasn't as tough as he was trying to appear, for both
our sakes. I leaned close again.
'You said it, Sullivan. I'm a thug. Not a respectable criminal like you. I'm not a
Meth, not a businessman. I have no vested interests, no social connections, no
purchased respectability. It's just me, and you're in my way. So let's start again.
Who sent Trepp?'
'He doesn't know, Kovacs. You're wasting your time.'
The woman's voice was light and cheerful, pitched a little loud to carry from the
door where she stood, hands in the pockets of a long black coat. She was slim
and pale with close-cropped dark hair and a poise to the way she stood that
bespoke combat skills. Beneath the coat she wore a grey quilted tunic that
looked impact resistant and matching work trousers tucked into ankle boots. A
single silver earring in the shape of a discarded trode cable dangled from her left
ear. She appeared to be alone.
I lowered the Philips gun slowly, and without acknowledging that it had ever
been trained on her she took the cue to advance casually into the restaurant. The
young men in silk watched her every step of the way, but if she was aware of
their gazes, she gave no sign. When she was about five paces from our booth,
she gave me a look of enquiry and began to lift her hands slowly out of her
pockets. I nodded, and she completed the movement, revealing open palms and
fingers set with rings of black glass.
'Trepp?'
'Good guess. You going to let me sit down?'
I waved the Philips gun at the seat opposite, where Sullivan was cupping both
hands to his eye. 'If you can persuade your associate here to move over. Just
keep your hands above the table.'
The woman smiled and inclined her head. She glanced at Sullivan, who was

already squeezing up to the wall to make space for her, and then, keeping her
hands poised at her sides, she swung herself elegantly in beside him. The
economy of motion was so tight that her pendant earring barely shifted. Once
seated, she pressed both hands palm down on the table in front of her.
'That make you feel safer?'
'It'll do,' I said, noticing that the black glass rings, like the earring, were a body
joke. Each ring showed, X-ray like, a ghostly blue section of the bones in the
fingers beneath. Trepp's style, at least, I could get to like.
'I didn't tell him anything,' Sullivan blurted.
'You didn't know anything worth a jack,' said Trepp disinterestedly. She hadn't
even turned to look at him. 'Lucky for you I turned up, I'd say. Mr Kovacs
doesn't look like someone ready to take "don't know" for an answer. Am I right?'
'What do you want, Trepp?'
'Come to help out.' Trepp glanced up as something rattled in the restaurant. The
waiter had arrived bearing a tray with a large teapot and two handleless cups.
'You order this?'
'Yeah. Help yourself.'
'Thanks, I love this stuff.' Trepp waited while the waiter deposited everything,
then busied herself with the teapot. 'Sullivan, you want a cup too? Hey, bring
him another cup, would you. Thanks. Now, where was I?'
'You'd come to help out,' I said pointedly.
'Yeah.' Trepp sipped at the green tea and looked at me over the rim of the cup.
'That's right. I'm here to clarify things. See, you're trying to hammer the
information out of Sullivan here. And he doesn't know fuck all. His contact was
me, so here I am. Talk to me.'
I looked at her levelly. 'I killed you last week, Trepp.'
'Yeah, so they tell me.' Trepp set down the tea cup and looked critically at her
own fingerbones. 'Course, I don't remember that. In fact, I don't even know you,

Kovacs. Last thing I remember was putting myself into the tank about a month
back. Everything after that's gone. The me you torched in that cruiser, she's dead.
That wasn't me. So, no hard feelings, huh?'
'No remote storage, Trepp?'
She snorted. 'Are you kidding? I make a living doing this, same as you, but not
that much. Anyway, who needs that remote shit? The way I figure it, you fuck
up, you've got to pay some kind of tab for it. I fucked up with you, right?'
I sipped my own tea and played back the fight in the aircar, considering the
angles. 'You were a little slow,' I conceded. 'A little careless.'
'Yeah, careless. I got to watch that. Wearing artificials makes you that way. Very
anti-Zen. I got a sensei in New York, it drives him up the fucking wall.'
'That's too bad,' I said patiently. 'You want to tell me who sent you now?'
'Hey, better than that. You're invited to meet the Man.' She nodded at my
expression. 'Yeah, Ray wants to talk to you. Same as last time, except this is a
voluntary ride. Seems coercion doesn't work too well with you.'
'And Kadmin? He in on this as well?'
Trepp drew breath in through her teeth. 'Kadmin's, well, Kadmin's a bit of a side
issue right now. Bit of an embarrassment really. But I think we can deal on that
as well. I really can't tell you too much more now.' She shuttled her glance
sideways at Sullivan, who was beginning to sit up and pay attention. 'It's better if
we go someplace else.'
'All right.' I nodded. 'I'll follow you out. But let's have a couple of ground rules
before we go. One, no virtuals.'
'Way ahead of you there.' Trepp finished her tea and started to get up from the
table. 'My instructions are to convey you directly to Ray. In the flesh.'
I put a hand on her arm and she stopped moving abruptly.
'Two. No surprises. You tell me exactly what's going to happen well before it
does. Anything unexpected, and you're likely to be disappointing your sensei all

over again.'
'Fine. No surprises.' Trepp produced a slightly forced smile that told me she
wasn't accustomed to being grabbed by the arm. 'We're going to walk out of the
restaurant and catch a taxi. That all right by you?'
'Just so long as it's empty.' I released her arm and she resumed motion, coming
fluidly upright, hands still well away from her sides. I reached into my pocket
and tossed a couple of plastic notes at Sullivan. 'You stay here. If I see your face
come through the door before we're gone, I'll put a hole in it. Tea's on me.'
As I followed Trepp to the door, the waiter arrived with Sullivan's tea cup and a
big white handkerchief, presumably for the warden's smashed lip. Nice kid. He
practically tripped over himself trying to stay out of my way, and the look he
gave me was mingled disgust and awe. In the wake of the icy fury that had
possessed me earlier, I sympathised more than he could have known.
The young men in silk watched us go with the dead-eyed concentration of
snakes.
Outside, it was still raining. I turned up my collar and watched as Trepp
produced a transport pager and waved it casually back and forth above her head.
'Be a minute,' she said, and gave me a curious sidelong glance. 'You know who
that place belongs to?'
'I guessed.'
She shook her head. 'Triad noodle house. Hell of a place for an interrogation. Or
do you just like living dangerously?'
I shrugged. 'Where I come from, criminals stay out of other people's fights.
They're a gutless lot, generally. Much more likely to get interference from a solid
citizen.'
'Not around here. Most solid citizens around here are a little too solid to get
involved in a brawl on some stranger's behalf. The way they figure it, that's what
the police are for. You're from Harlan's World, right?'
'That's right.'

'Maybe it's that Quellist thing, then. You reckon?'
'Maybe.'
An autocab came spiralling down through the rain in response to the pager.
Trepp stood aside at the open hatch and made an irony of demonstrating the
empty compartment within. I smiled thinly.
'After you.'
'Suit yourself.' She climbed aboard and moved over to let me in. I settled back on
the seat opposite her and watched her hands. When she saw where I was looking,
she grinned and spread her arms cruciform along the back of the seat. The hatch
hinged down, shedding rain in sliding sheets.
'Welcome to Urbline services,' said the cab smoothly. 'Please state your
destination.'
'Airport,' said Trepp, lounging back in her seat and looking for my reaction.
'Private carriers' terminal.'
The cab lifted. I looked past Trepp at the rain on the rear window. 'Not a local
trip, then,' I said tonelessly.
She brought her arms in again, hands held palm upward. 'Well, we figured you
wouldn't go virtual, so now we have to do it the hard way. Sub-orbital. Take
about three hours.'
'Sub-orbital?' I drew a deep breath and touched the bolstered Philips gun lightly.
'You know, I'm going to get really upset if someone asks me to check this
hardware before we fly.'
'Yeah, we figured that too. Relax Kovacs, you heard me say private terminal.
This is a custom flight, just for you. Carry a fucking tactical nuke on board if
you like. OK?'
'Where are we going, Trepp?'
She smiled.

'Europe,' she said.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

Wherever it was in Europe that we landed, the weather was better. We left the
blunt, windowless sub-orbital sitting on the fused glass runway, and walked to
the terminal building through glinting sunlight that was a physical pressure on
my body, even through my jacket. The sky above was an uncompromising blue
from horizon to horizon, and the air felt hard and dry. According to the pilot's
time-check, it was still only mid afternoon. I shrugged my way out of the jacket.
'Should be a limo waiting for us,' Trepp said over her shoulder.
We passed, without formality, into the terminal and across a zone of microclimate where palms and other less recognisable tropicalia made a bid for the
massive glass ceiling. A misty rain drifted down from sprinkler systems,
rendering the air pleasantly damp after the aridity outside. Along the aisles set
between the trees, children played and squalled, and old people sat dozily on
wrought iron benches in a seemingly impossible co-existence. The middle generations were gathered in knots at coffee stands, talking with more gesticulation
than I'd seen in Bay City and seemingly oblivious to the factors of time and
schedule that govern most terminal buildings.
I adjusted the jacket across my shoulder to cover my weapons as much as
possible and followed Trepp into the trees. It wasn't quick enough to beat the
gaze of two security guards standing under a palm nearby, or that of a little girl
scuffing her toes along the side of the aisle towards us. Trepp made a sign to the

security as they stiffened, and they fell back into their previous relaxed postures
with nods. Clearly, we were expected. The little girl wasn't so easily bought —
she stared up at me with wide eyes until I made a pistol out of my fingers arid
shot her with noisy sound effects. Then she showed her teeth in a huge grin and
hid behind the nearest bench. I heard her shooting me in the back all the way
along the aisle.
Outside again, Trepp steered me past a mob of taxis to where an anonymous
black cruiser was idling in a no-waiting zone. We climbed into air-conditioned
cool and pale grey automould seating.
'Ten minutes,' she promised, as we rose into the air. 'What did you think of the
micro-climate?'
'Very nice.'
'Got them all over the airport. Weekends, people come out from the centre to
spend the day here. Weird, huh?'
I grunted and watched the window as we banked over the whorled settlement
patterns of a major city. Further out, a dusty-looking plain stretched to the
horizon and the almost painful blue of the sky. To the left, I could make out the
rise of mountains.
Trepp seemed to pick up on my disinclination to talk and she busied herself with
a phone jack that she plugged in behind the ear with the ironic pendant. Another
internal chip. Her eyes closed as she began the call, and I was left with the
peculiar feeling of aloneness that you get when someone's using one of those
things.
Alone was fine with me.
The truth was that I'd been a poor travelling companion for Trepp for most of the
journey. In the cabin of the sub-ship I'd been steadfastly withdrawn despite
Trepp's obvious interest in my background. Finally she gave up trying to extract
anecdotes about Harlan’s World and the Corps and tried instead to teach me a
couple of card games she knew. Impelled by some ghost of cultural politeness, I
reciprocated, but two isn't an ideal number for cards and neither of our hearts
was in it. We landed in Europe in silence, each flipping through our own
selection from the jet's media stack. Despite Trepp's apparent lack of concern on

the subject, I was having a hard time forgetting the circumstances of our last trip
together.
Below us, the plain gave way to increasingly green uplands and then one valley
in particular where the forested crags seemed to close around something manmade. As we started to descend, Trepp unjacked herself with a flutter of eyelids
that meant she hadn't bothered to disconnect the chip synapses first — strictly
advised against by most manufacturers, but maybe she was showing off. I barely
noticed. Most of me was absorbed in the thing we were landing beside.
It was a massive stone cross, larger than any I'd seen before and weather stained
with age. As the cruiser spiralled down towards its base and then beyond, I
realised that whoever had built the monument had set it on a huge central
buttress of rock so it gave the impression of a titanic broadsword sunk into the
earth by some retired warrior god. It was entirely in keeping with the dimensions
of the mountains around it, as if no human agency could possibly have put it
there. The stepped terraces of stone and ancillary buildings below the buttress,
themselves monumental in size, shrank almost to insignificance under the
brooding presence of this single artefact.
Trepp was watching me with a glitter in her eyes.
The limo settled on one of the stone expanses and I climbed out, blinking up
through the sun at the cross.
'This belong to the Catholics?' I hazarded.
'Used to.' Trepp started towards a set of towering steel doors in the rock ahead.
'Back when it was new. It's private property now.'
'How come?'
'Ask Ray.' Now it was Trepp who seemed uninterested in conversation. It was
almost as if something in the vast structure was calling a different part of her
character into ascendancy. She drifted to the doors as if attracted there by
magnetism.
As we reached the portals, they yawned slowly open with a dull hum of powered
hinges and stopped with an aperture of two metres between them. I gestured at
Trepp, and she stepped over the threshold with a shrug. Something big moved

spiderlike down the walls in the dimness to either side of the entrance. I slipped
a hand to the butt of the Nemex, knowing as I did that it was futile. We were in
the land of the giants now.
Skeletal gun barrels the length of a man's body emerged from the gloom as the
two robot sentry systems sniffed us over. I judged the calibre as about the same
as the Hendrix's lobby defence system, and relinquished my weapons. With a
vaguely insectile chittering, the automated killing units drew back and spidered
up the walls to their roosting points. At the base of the two alcoves they lived in,
I could make out massive iron angels with swords.
'Come on.' Trepp's voice was unnaturally loud in the cathedral hush. 'You think if
we wanted to kill you, we would have brought you all the way here?'
I followed her down a flight of stone steps and into the main body of the
chamber. We were in a huge basilica that must run the length of the rock buttress
beneath the cross and whose ceiling was lost in gloom high above us. Up ahead
was another set of steps, leading onto a raised and slightly narrower section
where the lighting was stronger. As we reached it, I saw that the roof here was
vaulted over the stone statues of hooded guardians, their hands resting on thick
broadswords and their lips curled into faintly contemptuous smiles below their
hoods.
I felt my own lips twist in fractional response, and my thoughts were all of high
yield explosives.
At the end of the basilica, grey things were hanging in the air. For a moment I
thought I was looking at a series of shaped monoliths embedded in a permanent
force field, and then one of the grey things shifted slightly in a stray current of
the chilly air, and I suddenly knew what they were.
'Are you impressed, Takeshi-san?'
The voice, the elegant Japanese in which I was addressed, hit me like cyanide.
My breathing locked up momentarily with the force of my emotions and I felt a
jagged current go though the neurachem system as it responded. I allowed
myself to turn towards the voice, slowly. Somewhere under my eye, a muscle
twitched with the suppressed will to do violence.
'Ray,' I said, in Amanglic. 'I should have fucking seen this one on the launch

pad.'
Reileen Kawahara stepped from a doorway to one side of the circular chamber
where the basilica ended and made an ironic bow. She followed me into
Amanglic flawlessly.
'Perhaps you should have seen it coming, yes,' she mused. 'But if there's a single
thing that I like about you, Kovacs, it is your endless capacity to be surprised.
For all your war veteran posturing, you remain at core an innocent. And in these
times that is no mean achievement. How do you do it?'
'Trade secret. You'd have to be a human being to understand it.'
The insult fell unregarded. Kawahara looked down at the marbled floor as if she
could see it lying there.
'Yes, well, I believe we've been over this ground before.'
My mind fled back to New Beijing and the cancerous power structures that
Kawahara's interests had created there, the discordant screams of the tortured
that I had come to associate with her name.
I stepped closer to one of the grey envelopes and slapped it. The coarse surface
gave under my hand and the thing swung a little on its cables. Something shifted
sluggishly within.
'Bullet-proof, right?'
'Mmm.' Kawahara tipped her head to one side. 'Depends on the bullet, I would
say. But impact resistant, certainly.'
I manufactured a laugh from somewhere. 'Bullet-proof womb lining! Only you,
Kawahara. Only you would need to bullet-proof your clones, and then bury them
under a mountain.'
She stepped forward into the light then, and the force of my hate came up and hit
me in the pit of the stomach as I looked at her. Reileen Kawahara claimed
upbringing among the contaminated slums of Fission City, Western Australia,
but if it was true, she had long ago left behind any trace of her origins. The
figure opposite me had the poise of a dancer, a balance of body that was subtly

attractive without calling forth any immediate hormonal response, and the face
above was elfin and intelligent. It was the sleeve she had worn on New Beijing,
custom cultured and untouched by implants of any kind. Pure organism, elevated
to the level of art. Kawahara had garbed it in black, stiff tulip-petalled skirts
cupping her lower body to mid-calf and a soft silk blouse settling over her torso
like dark water. The shoes on her feet were modelled on spacedeck slippers but
with a modest heel, and her auburn hair was short and winged back from the
clean-boned face. She looked like the inhabitant of a screen ad for some slightly
sexy investment fund.
'Power is habitually buried,' she said. 'Think of the Protectorate bunkers on
Harlan's World. Or the caverns the Envoy Corps hid you in while you were made
over in their image. The essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it
not?'
'Judging by the way I've been led around the last week, I'd say yes. Now do you
want to get on with this pitch?'
'Very well.' Kawahara glanced aside at Trepp, who wandered away into the
gloom, neck craned up at the ceiling like a tourist. I looked around for a seat and
found none. 'You are aware, no doubt, that I recommended you to Laurens
Bancroft.'
'He mentioned it.'
'Yes, and had your hotel proved slightly less psychotic, matters would never
have got as far out of hand as they have. We could have had this conversation a
week ago, and saved everyone a lot of unnecessary pain. It was not my intention
for Kadmin to harm you. His instructions were to bring you here alive.'
'There's been a change of programme,' I said, walking along the curve of the end
chamber. 'Kadmin's not following his instructions. He tried to kill me this morning.'
Kawahara made a gesture of irritation. 'I know that. That's why you've been
brought here.'
'Did you spring him?'
'Yes, of course.'

'He was going to roll over on you?'
'He told Keith Rutherford that he felt he was not deployed to his best advantage
in holding. That it would be hard to honour his contract with me in such a
position.'
'Subtle.'
'Wasn't it. I never can resist sophisticated negotiation. I feel he earnt the reinvestment.'
'So you beaconed in on me, hooked him out and beamed him over to Carnage for
re-sleeving, right?' I felt in my pockets and found Ortega's cigarettes. In the grim
twilight of the basilica, the familiar packet was like a postcard from another
place. 'No wonder the Panama Rose didn't have his second fighter decanted
when we got there. He'd probably only just finished sleeving Kadmin. That
motherfucker walked out of there in a Right Hand of God martyr.'
'About the same time you were coming aboard,' agreed Kawahara. 'In fact, I
understand he was posing as a menial and you walked right past him. I'd rather
you didn't smoke in here.'
'Kawahara, I'd rather you died of an internal haemorrhage, but I don't suppose
you'll oblige me.' I touched my cigarette to the ignition patch and drew it to life,
remembering. The man knelt in the ring. I played it back slowly. On the deck of
the fightdrome ship, peering down at the design being painted onto the killing
floor. The upturned face as we passed. Yes, he'd even smiled. I grimaced at the
memory.
'You're being a lot less courteous than befits a man in your situation.' I thought
that, underneath the cool, I could detect a ragged edge in her voice. Despite her
much vaunted self-control, Reileen Kawahara wasn't much better at coping with
disrespect than Bancroft, General Maclntyre or any other creature of power I'd
had dealings with. 'Your life is in danger and I am in a position to safeguard it.'
'My life's been in danger before,' I told her. 'Usually as a result of some piece of
shit like you making large-scale decisions about how reality ought to be run.
You've already let Kadmin get too close for my comfort. In fact, he probably
used your fucking virtual locater to do it.'

'I sent him,' Kawahara gritted, 'to collect you. Again he disobeyed me.'
'Didn't he just.' I rubbed reflexively at the bruise on my shoulder. 'So why should
I believe you can do any better next time?'
'Because you know I can.' Kawahara came across the centre of the chamber,
ducking her head to avoid the leathery grey clone sacs, and intercepting my path
around the perimeter. Her face was taut with anger. 'I am one of the seven most
powerful human beings in this solar system. I have access to powers that the UN
Field Commander General would kill for.'
'This architecture's going to your head, Reileen. You wouldn't even have found
me if you hadn't been keeping tabs on Sullivan. How the fuck are you going to
find Kadmin?'
'Kovacs, Kovacs.' There was a definite trembling in her laugh, as if she was
fighting an urge to put her thumbs through my eye sockets. 'Do you have any
idea what happens on the streets of any given city on Earth, if I put out a search
on someone? Do you have any idea how easy it would be to snuff you out here
and now?'
I drew deliberately on the cigarette and plumed the smoke out at her. 'As your
faithful retainer Trepp said, not ten minutes ago, why bring me here just to snuff
me out? You want something from me. Now what is it?'
She breathed in through her nose, hard. A measure of calm seeped onto her face
and she stepped back a couple of paces, turned away from the confrontation.
'You're right, Kovacs. I want you alive. If you disappear now, Bancroft's going to
get the wrong message.'
'Or the right message.' I scuffed absently at engraved lettering on the stone
beneath my feet. 'Did you torch him?'
'No.' Kawahara looked almost amused. 'He killed himself.'
'Yeah, right.'
'Whether you believe it or not is immaterial to me, Kovacs. What I want from
you is an end to the investigation. A tidy end.'

'And how do you suggest I achieve that?'
'I don't care. Make something up. You're an Envoy, after all. Convince him. Tell
him you think the police verdict was correct. Produce a culprit, if you must.' A
thin smile. 'I do not include myself in that category.'
'If you didn't kill him, if he torched his own head off, why should you care what
happens? What's your interest in this?'
'That isn't under discussion here.'
I nodded slowly. 'And what do I get in return for this tidy ending?'
'Apart from the hundred thousand dollars?' Kawahara tilted her head quizzically.
'Well, I understand you've been made a very generous recreational offer by other
parties. And for my part, I will keep Kadmin off your back by whatever means
necessary.'
I looked down at the lettering beneath my feet, and thought it through, link by
link.
'Francisco Franco,' said Kawahara, mistaking the direction of my gaze for
focused interest. 'Petty tyrant a long time back. He built this place.'
'Trepp said it belonged to the Catholics.'
Kawahara shrugged. 'Petty tyrant with delusions of religion. Catholics get on
well with tyranny. It's in the culture.'
I glanced around, ostensibly casual, scanning for robot security systems. 'Yeah,
looks like it. So let me get this straight. You want me to sell Bancroft a parabolic
full of shit, in return for which you'll call off Kadmin, who you set on me in the
first place. That's the deal?'
'That, as you put it, is the deal.'
I took one last lungful of smoke, savoured it and exhaled.
'You can go fuck yourself, Kawahara.' I dropped my cigarette on the engraved
stonework and ground it out with my heel. 'I'll take my chances with Kadmin,

and let Bancroft know you probably had him killed. So. Change your mind about
letting me live now?'
My hands hung open at my sides, twitching to be filled with the rough woven
bulk of handgun butts. I was going to put three Nemex shells through
Kawahara's throat, at stack height, then put the gun in my mouth and blow my
own stack apart. Kawahara almost certainly had remote storage anyway, but fuck
it, you've got to make a stand somewhere. And a man can only stave off his own
death wish for so long.
It could have been worse. It could have been Innenin.
Kawahara shook her head regretfully. She was smiling. 'Always the same
Kovacs. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Romantic nihilism. Haven't
you learnt anything since New Beijing?'
'There are some arenas so corrupt that the only dean acts possible are nihilistic.'
'Oh, that's Quell, isn't it? Mine was Shakespeare, but then I don't expect colonial
culture goes back that far, does it?' She was still smiling, poised like a total body
theatre gymnast about to launch into her aria. For a moment I suffered the almost
hallucinatory conviction that she was going to break into a little dance,
choreographed to a junk rhythm beat from speakers hidden in the dome above
us.
'Takeshi, where did you get this belief that everything can be resolved with such
brute simplicity? Surely not from the Envoys? Was it the Newpest gangs? The
thrashings your father gave you as a child? Did you really think I would allow
you to force my hand? Did you really think I would have come to the table this
empty-handed? Think about it. You know me. Did you really believe it would be
this easy?'
The neurachem seethed within me. I bit it back, hung from the moment like a
parachutist braced in the jump hatch.
'All right,' I said evenly. 'Impress me.'
'Gladly.' Kawahara reached into the breast pocket of her liquid black blouse. She
produced a tiny holofile and flicked it into active with a thumbnail. As the
images evolved in the air above the unit, she passed it to me. 'A lot of the detail

is legalistic, but you will of course recognise the salient points.'
I took the little sphere of light as if it were a poisonous flower. The name hit me
at once, leaping out of the print —
— Sarah Sachilowska —
— and then the contract terminology, like a building coming down on me in
slow motion.
— released into private storage —
— provision for virtual custody —
— unlimited period —
— subject to review at UN discretion —
under vested authority of the Bay City justice facility —
The knowledge coursed sickly through me. I should have killed Sullivan when I
had the chance.
'Ten days.' Kawahara was watching my reactions closely. 'That's how long you
have to convince Bancroft the investigation is over, and to walk away. After that,
Sachilowska goes into virtual at one of my clinics. There's a whole new
generation of virtual interrogation software out there, and I will personally see to
it that she pioneers the lot.'
The holofile hit the marble floor with a brittle crack. I lurched at Kawahara, lips
peeling back from my teeth. There was a low growling coming up through my
throat that had nothing to do with any combat training I had ever undergone and
my hands crooked into talons. I knew what her blood was going to taste like.
The cold barrel of a gun touched down on my neck before I got halfway.
'I'd advise against that,' said Trepp in my ear.
Kawahara came and stood closer to me. 'Bancroft isn't the only one that can buy
troublesome criminals off colonial stacks. The Kanagawa justice facility were

overjoyed when I came to them two days later with a bid for Sachilowska. The
way they see it, if you're freighted offworld, the chances of you ever having
enough money to buy a needlecast back again are pretty slim. And of course
they get paid for the privilege of waving you goodbye. It must seem too good to
be true. ] imagine they're hoping it's the start of a trend.' She fingered the lapel of
my jacket thoughtfully. 'And in fact the way the virtuals market is at the moment,
it might be a trend worth starting.'
The muscle under my eye jumped violently.
'I'll kill you,' I whispered. 'I'll rip your fucking heart out and eat it. I'll bring this
place down around you — '
Kawahara leaned in until our faces were almost touching. Her breath smelt
faintly of mint and oregano. 'No, you won't,' she said. 'You'll do exactly as I say,
and you'll do it within ten days. Because if you don't, your friend Sachilowska
will be starting her own private tour of hell without redemption.'
She stepped back and lifted her hands. 'Kovacs, you should be thanking
whatever deities they've got on Harlan's World that I'm not some kind of sadist. I
mean, I've given you an either/or. We could just as easily be negotiating exactly
how much agony I put Sachilowska through. I mean, I could start now. That
would give you an incentive to wrap things up speedily, wouldn't it? Ten days in
most virtuals adds up to about three or four years. You were in the Wei Clinic; do
you think she could stand three years of that? I think she'd probably go insane,
don't you?'
The effort it cost me to contain my hate was like a rupture down behind my
eyeballs and into my chest. I forced the words out.
'Terms. How do I know you'll release her?'
'Because I give you my word.' Kawahara let her arms fall to her sides. 'I believe
you've had some experience of its validity in the past.'
I nodded slowly.
'Subsequent to Bancroft's acceptance that the case is closed, and your own
disappearance from view, I will freight Sachilowska back to Harlan's World to
complete her sentence.' Kawahara bent to pick up the holofile I'd dropped and

held it up. She tipped it deftly a couple of times to flick through the pages. 'I
think you can see here that there is a reversal clause written into the contract. I
will of course forfeit a large proportion of the original fee paid, but under the
circumstances I'm prepared to do that.' She smiled faintly. 'But please bear in
mind that a reversal can work in both directions. What I return, I can always buy
again. So if you were considering skulking in the undergrowth for a while and
then running back to Bancroft, please abandon the idea now. This is a hand that
you cannot win.'
The gun barrel lifted away from my neck and Trepp stepped back. The
neurachem held me upright like a paraplegic's mobility suit. I stared numbly at
Kawahara.
'Why the fuck did you do all this?' I whispered. 'Why involve me at all, if you
didn't want Bancroft to find his answers?'
'Because you are an Envoy, Kovacs.' Kawahara spoke slowly, as if talking to a
child. 'Because if anybody can convince Laurens Bancroft that he died by his
own hand, it is you. And because I knew you well enough to predict your moves.
I arranged to have you brought to me almost as soon as you arrived, but the hotel
intervened. And then when chance brought you to the Wei Clinic I endeavoured
to bring you here once again.'
'I bluffed my way out of the Wei Clinic.'
'Oh, yes. Your biopirate story. You really think you sold them that second-rate
experia rubbish? Be reasonable, Kovacs. You might have backed them up a
couple of steps while they thought about it, but the reason, the only reason you
got out of the Wei Clinic intact was because I'told them to send you that way.'
She shrugged. 'But then you insisted upon escaping. It has been a messy week,
and I blame myself as much as anyone else. I feel like a behaviourist who has
designed her rat's maze poorly.'
'All right.' I noted vaguely that I was trembling. 'I'll do it.'
'Yes. Of course you will.'
I searched for something else to say, but it felt as if I had been clinically drained
of the potential for resistance. The cold of the basilica seemed to be creeping
into my bones. I mastered the trembling with an effort and turned to go. Trepp

moved silently forward to join me. We had gone about a dozen steps when
Kawahara called out behind me.
'Oh, Kovacs . . . '
I turned as if in a dream. She was smiling.
'If you do manage to wrap it up cleanly, and very quickly, I might consider some
kind of cash incentive. A bonus, so to speak. Negotiable. Trepp will give you a
contact number.'
I turned away again, numb to a degree I hadn't felt since the smoking ruins of
Innenin. Vaguely, I felt Trepp clap me on the shoulder.
'Come on,' she said companionably. 'Let's get out of here.'
I followed her out under the soul-bruising architecture, beneath the sneering
smiles of the hooded guardians, and I knew that from among her grey-wombed
clones, Kawahara was watching me all the way with a similar smile. It seemed to
take forever to leave the hall and when the huge steel portals cracked open to
reveal the outside world, the light that spilled inward was an infusion of life that
I grabbed at like a drowning man. All at once, the basilica was a vertical, a cold
depth of ocean out of which I was reaching for the sun on the rippled surface. As
we left the shadows, my body sucked up the warmth on offer as if it were a solid
sustenance. Very gradually, the shivering began to leave me.
But as I walked away, beneath the brooding power of the cross, I could still feel
the presence of the place like a cold hand on the nape of my neck.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

That night was a blur. Later, when I tried to get it back, even Envoy recall would
only give me fragments.
Trepp wanted a night on the town. The best nightlife in Europe, she maintained,
was only minutes away, and she had all the right addresses.
I wanted my thought processes stopped dead in their tracks.

We started in a hotel room on a street I could not pronounce. Some tetrameth
analogue fired through the whites of our eyes by needlespray. I sat passively in a
chair by the window and let Trepp shoot me up, trying to not think about Sarah
and the room in Millsport. Trying not to think at all. Two-tone holographies
outside the window cast Trepp's concentrated features in shades of red and
bronze, a demon in the act of sealing the pact. I felt the insidious tilt at the
corners of perception as the tetrameth went barrelling along my synapses, and
when it was my turn to do Trepp I almost got lost in the geometries of her face.
This was very good stuff . . .

There were murals of the Christian hell, flames leaping like clawed fingers over
a procession of screaming, naked sinners. At one end of the room, where the

figures on the walls seemed to blend with the denizens of the bar in smoke and
noise, a girl danced on a rotating platform. A cupped petal of black glass scythed
around with the platform and each time it passed between audience and dancer,
the girl was gone and a skeleton danced grinning in her place.
'This place is called All Flesh Will Perish,' yelled Trepp above the noise as we
forced our way in through the crowd. She pointed to the girl and then to the
black glass rings on her fingers. 'Where I got the idea for these. Great effect, isn't
it?'
I got drinks, quickly.

The human race has dreamed of heaven and hell for millennia. Pleasure or pain
unending, undiminished and uncurtailed by the strictures of life or death. Thanks
to virtual formatting, these fantasies can now exist. All that is needed is an
industrial-capacity power generator. We have indeed made hell — and heaven —
on earth.
'Sounds a bit epic, Angin Chandra's outward-bound valediction to the people sort
of thing,' shouted Trepp. 'But I take your point.'
Evidently the words that had been running through my mind were also running
out of my mouth. If it was a quote, I didn't know where it was from. Certainly
not a Quellism; she would have slapped anyone making that kind of speech.
'Thing is,' Trepp was still yelling, 'you've got ten days.'

Reality tilts, flows sideways in gobs of flame-coloured light. Music. Motion and
laughter. The rim of a glass under' my teeth. A warm thigh pressed against my
own which I think is Trepp's, but when I turn another woman with long straight
black hair and crimson lips is grinning at me. Her look of open invitation
reminds me vaguely of something I've seen recently —

Street scene:

Tiered balconies on either side, tongues of light and sound splashed out onto
pavements from the myriad tiny bars, the street itself knotted with people. I
walked beside the woman I had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a
conversation about cats.
There was something I had forgotten. Something clouded.
Something impor —
'You can't nicking believe something like that,' Trepp burst out. Or in, into my
skull at the moment I had almost crystallised what I —
Was she doing it deliberately? I couldn't even remember what it was I'd believed
so strongly about cats a moment ago.

Dancing, somewhere.

More meth, eye-shot on a street corner, leaning against a wall. Someone walked
past, called something out to us. I blinked and tried to look.
'Fuck, hold still will you!'
'What'd she say?'
Trepp peeled back my eyelids again, frowning with concentration.
'Called us both beautiful. Fucking junkie, probably after a handout.'

In a wood-panelled toilet somewhere, I stared into a fragmented mirror at the
face I was wearing as if it had committed a crime against me. Or as if I was
waiting for someone else to emerge from behind the seamed features. My hands
were braced on the filthy metal basin below, and the epoxy strips bonding the
thing to the wall emitted minute tearing sounds under my weight.
I had no idea how long I'd been there.

I had no idea where there was. Or how many theres we had already been through
tonight.
None of this seemed to matter because . . .
The mirror didn't fit its frame — there were pointed jags dug into the plastic
edges holding the star-shaped centre precariously in place.
Too many edges, I muttered to myself. None of this fucking fits together.
The words seemed significant, like an accidental rhythm and rhyme in ordinary
speech. I didn't think I'd ever be able to repair this mirror. I was going to cut my
fingers to shreds, just trying. Fuck that.
I left Ryker's face in the mirror, and staggered back out to a table piled high with
candles where Trepp was sipping at a long ivory pipe.

'Micky Nozawa? Are you serious?'
'Fuck, yes.' Trepp nodded vigorously. 'The Fist of the Fleet, right? Seen it four
times at least. New York experia chains get a lot of imported colonial stuff. It's
getting to be quite chic. That bit where he takes the harpoonist out with the
flying kick. You feel it right down to the bone, the way he delivers that fucking
kick. Beautiful. Poetry in motion. Hey, you know he did some holoporn stuff
when he was younger.'
'Bullshit. Micky Nozawa never did porn. He didn't need to.'
'Who said anything about need. The couple of bimb-ettes he was playing around
with, I would have played around with them for free.'
'Bull. Shit.'
'I swear to God. That sleeve with the sort of Caucasian nose and eyes, the one he
wrote off in that cruiser wreck. Real early stuff.'

There was a bar, where the walls and ceiling were hung with absurd hybrid
musical instruments and the shelves behind the bar were stacked solid with
antique bottles, intricately worked statuettes and other nameless junk. The noise
level was comparatively low and I was drinking something that didn't taste as if
it was doing my system too much immediate harm. There was a faint musk in
the air and small trays of sweetmeats on the tables.
'Why the fuck do you do it?'
'What?' Trepp shook her head muzzily. 'Keep cats? I like ca — '
'Work for fucking Kawahara. She's a fucking abortion of a human being, a
fucked up Meth cunt not worth the slag of a stack, why do you — '
Trepp grabbed the arm I was gesturing with, and for a moment I thought there
was going to be violence. The neurachem surged soggily.
Instead, she took the arm and draped it affectionately over her own shoulders,
pulling my face closer to her own. She blinked owlishly at me.
'Listen.'
There was a longish pause. I listened, while Trepp frowned with concentration,
took a long slug from her glass and set it down with exaggerated care. She
wagged a finger at me.
'Judge not lest ye be judged,' she slurred.

Another street, sloping downward. Walking was suddenly easier.
Above, the stars were out in force, clearer than I had seen them all week in Bay
City. I lurched to a halt at the sight, looking for the Horned Horse.
Something. Wrong here.
Alien. Not a single pattern I recognised. A cold sweat broke along the insides of
my arms, and suddenly the clear points of fire seemed like an armada from the
Outside, massing for a planetary bombardment. The Martians returned. I thought

I could see them moving ponderously across the narrow slice of sky above us . . .
'Whoa.' Trepp caught me as I fell, laughing. 'What you looking for up there,
grasshopper?'
Not my sky.

It's getting bad.
In another toilet, painfully brightly lit, Pin trying to stuff some powder Trepp
gave me up my nose. My nasal passages are already seared dry and it keeps
falling back down, as if this body has definitively had enough. A cubicle flushes
behind me and I glance up into the big mirror.
Jimmy de Soto emerges from the cubicle, combat fatigues smudged with Innenin
mud. In the hard bathroom light his face is looking particularly bad.
'All right, pal?'
'Not especially.' I scratch at the inside of my nose, which is beginning to feel
inflamed. 'You?'
He makes a mustn't-grumble gesture and moves forward in the mirror to stand
beside me. Water fountains from the light-sensitive tap as he leans over the
basin, and he begins to rinse his hands. Mud and gore dissolve off his skin and
form a rich soup, pouring away down the tiny maelstrom of the plughole. I can
sense his bulk at -my shoulder, but his one remaining eye has me pinned to the
image in the mirror and I cannot, or don't want to, turn.
'Is this a dream?'
He shrugs and goes on scrubbing at his hands. 'It's the edge,' he says.
'The edge of what?'
'Everything.' His expression suggests that this much is obvious.
'I thought you only turned up in my dreams,' I say, casually glancing at his

hands. There is something wrong with them; however much filth Jimmy scrubs
off, there is more underneath. The basin is splattered with the stuff.
Well, that's one way of putting it, pal. Dreams, high stress hallucinations, or just
wrecking your own head like this. It's all the edge, see. The cracks down the
sides of reality. Where stupid bastards like me end up.'
'Jimmy, you're dead. I'm getting tired of telling you that.'
'Uhuh.' He shakes his head. 'But you got to get right down in those cracks to
access me.'
The soup of blood and soil in the basin is thinning out and I know suddenly that
when it is gone, Jimmy will be too.
'You 're saying — '
He shakes his head sadly. 'Too flicking complicated to go through now. You think
we've got the handle on reality, just 'cause we can record bits of it. More to it
than that, pal. More to it than that.'
'Jimmy,' I make a helpless gesture, 'what the fuck am I going to do?'
He steps back from the basin and his ruined face grins garishly at me.
'Viral Strike,' he says clearly. I go cold as I remember my own scream taken up
along the beachhead. 'Recall that mother, do you?'
And, flicking water from his hands, he vanishes like a conjuror's trick.

'Look,' said Trepp reasonably, 'Kadmin had to check into the tank to get sleeved
in an artificial. I figure that gives you the best part of a day before he even
knows if he killed you or not.'
'If he wasn't already double-sleeved again.'
'No. Think about it. He's cut loose from Kawahara. Man, he doesn't have the
resources for that kind of stuff right now. He's fucking out there on his own, and

with Kawahara gunning for him, he's a strictly limited item. Kadmin's sell-by
date is coming up, you'll see.'
'Kawahara's going to keep him on tap for just as long as she needs him to drive
me.'
'Yeah, well.' Trepp looked at her drink, embarrassed. 'Maybe.'

There was another place, called Cable or something synonymous, where the
walls were racked with colour-coded conduits out of whose designer-cracked
casings wires sprouted like stiff copper hair. At intervals along the bar were
hooks draped with thin, lethal -looking cables that ended in gleaming silver
minijacks. In the air above the bar, a huge holographic jack and socket flicked
spasmodically to the off-beat music that filled the place like water. At times, the
components seemed to change into sex organs, but that could have been
tetrameth-induced hallucination on my part.
I was sitting at the bar, something sweet smouldering in an ashtray at my elbow.
From the sludgy feeling in my lungs and throat, I'd been smoking it. The bar was
crowded but I suffered the strange conviction I was alone.
On either side of me, the other customers at the bar were jacked into the thin
cables, eyes flickering beneath lids that seemed bruised, mouths twitched into
dreamy half smiles. One of them was Trepp.
I was alone.
Things that might have been thoughts were tugging at the abraded underside of
my mind. I picked up the cigarette and drew on it, grimly. Now was no time for
thinking.

No time for —
Viral Strike!!!
— thinking.

Streets passing beneath my feet the way the rubble of Innenin passed under
Jimmy's boots as he walked along beside me in my dreams. So that's how he
does it.
The crimson-lipped woman who —
Maybe you can't —
What? What???
Jack and socket.
Trying to tell you some —
No time for —
No time —
No —
And away, like water in the maelstrom, like the soup of mud and gore pouring
offjimmy's hands and into the hole at the bottom of the sink . . .
Gone again.

But thought, like the dawn, was inevitable and it found me, with the dawn, on a
set of white stone steps that led down into murky water. Grandiose architecture
reared vaguely behind us and on the far side of the water I could make out trees
in the rapidly greying darkness. We were in a park.
Trepp leaned over my shoulder and offered me a lit cigarette. I took it
reflexively, drew once and then let smoke dribble up through my slack lips.
Trepp settled into a crouch next to me. An unfeasibly large fish flopped in the
water at my feet. I was too eroded to react.
'Mutant,' said Trepp inconsequentially.
'Same to you.'

The little shreds of conversation drifted away over the water.
'Going to need painkillers?'
'Probably.' I felt around inside my head. 'Yeah.'
She handed me a wafer of impressively-coloured capsules without comment.
'What you going to do?'
I shrugged. 'Going to go back. Going to do what I'm told.'

PART 4 : PERSUASION
(VIRAL CORRUPT)

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

I changed cabs three times on the way from the airport, paying each one in
currency, and then booked into an all-night flophouse in Oakland. Anyone
tailing me electronically was going to take a little while to catch up, and I was
reasonably sure that I hadn't been actually followed. It seemed a bit like paranoia
— after all, I was working for the bad guys now, so they had no need to tail me.
But I hadn't liked Trepp's ironic keep in touch as she saw me off from the Bay
City terminal. Also, I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to do yet, and if I
didn't know, I certainly didn't want anyone else knowing either.
The flophouse room had seven hundred and eighty-six screen channels, holoporn
and current affairs both advertised in lurid colours on the standby display, a
hinged, self-cleansing double bed that stank of disinfectant and a self-contained
shower stall that was beginning to list away from the wall it had once been
epoxied to. I peered out of the single grimy window. It was the middle of the
night in Bay City, and there was a fine, misty rain falling. My deadline with
Ortega was running out.
The window gave onto a sloping fibrecrete roof about ten metres below. The
street was as far below again. Overhead, a pagoda-like upper level screened the
lower roof and street under long eaves. Covered space. After a moment's debate,
I pressed the last of Trepp's hangover capsules out of the foil and swallowed it,
then opened the window as quietly as I could, swung out and hung by my fingers
from the lower frame. Fully extended, I still had the best part of eight metres to

fall.
Go primitive. Well, you don't get much more primitive than climbing out of hotel
windows in the middle of the night.
Hoping the roof was as solid as it looked, I let go.
I hit the sloping surface in approved fashion, rolled to one side and abruptly
found my legs hanging out into space once more. The surface was firm, but as
slippery as fresh belaweed and I was slithering rapidly towards the edge. I
ground my elbows down for purchase, found none and just managed to grab the
sharp edge of the roof in one hand as I went over.
Ten-metres to the street. With the roof edge slicing into my palm, I dangled by
one arm for a moment, trying to identify possible obstacles to my fall, like trash
bins or parked vehicles, then gave up and dropped anyway. The paving beneath
came up and smacked me hard, but there was nothing sharp to compound the
impact and when I rolled it: was not into the feared assembly of trash bins. I got
up and made for the nearest shadows.
Ten minutes and a random sampling of streets later, I came upon a rank of idling
autocabs, stepped swiftly out from my current piece of overhead cover and got
into the fifth in line. I recited Ortega's discreet code as we lifted into the air.
'Coding noted. Approximate arrival time, thirty-five minutes.'
We headed out across the Bay, and then out to sea.

Too many edges.
The fragmented contents of the previous night bubbled in my brain like a
carelessly made fish stew. Indigestible chunks appeared on the surface, wobbled
in the currents of memory and sank again. Trepp jacked into the bar at Cable,
Jimmy de Soto washing his blood-encrusted hands, Ryker's face staring back at
me from the spreadeagled star of mirror. Kawahara was in there somewhere,
claiming Bancroft's death as suicide but wanting an end to the investigation, just
like Ortega and the Bay City police. Kawahara, who knew things about my
contact with Miriam Bancroft, knew things about Laurens Bancroft, about

Kadmin.
The tail end of my hangover twitched, scorpion-like, fighting the slow-gathering
weight of Trepp's painkillers. Trepp, the apologetic Zen killer whom I'd killed
and who'd apparently come back with no hard feelings because she couldn't
remember it; because, in her terms, it hadn't happened to her.
If anybody can convince Laurens Bancroft that he died by his own hand, it is
you.
Trepp, jacked in at Cable.
Viral Strike. Recall that mother, do you?
Bancroft's eyes boring into mine on the balcony at Suntouch House. I am not the
kind of man to take my own life, and even if I were, I would not have bungled it
in this fashion. If it had been my intention to die, you mould not be talking to me
now.
And then, blindingly, I knew what I was going to do.
The cab started downward.

'Footing is unstable,' said the machine redundantly, as we touched down on a
rolling deck. 'Please take care.'
I fed currency to the slot and the hatch hinged up on Ortega's safe location. A
brief expanse of gumnetal landing pad, railings of cabled steel, and the sea
beyond, all shifting black shoulders of water beneath a night sky clogged with
cloud and hard drizzle. I climbed out warily and clung to the nearest railing
while the cab lifted away and was quickly swallowed by the drifting veils of
rain. As the navigation lights faded, I turned my attention to the vessel I was
standing on.
The landing pad was situated at the stern, and from where I clung to the railing I
could see the whole length of the ship laid out. She looked to be about twenty
metres, something like two thirds the size of a Millsport trawler, but much leaner
in the beam. The deck modules had the smooth, self-sealing configuration of

storm survival design, but despite the general businesslike appearance, no one
would ever take this for a working vessel. Delicate telescopic masts rose to what
looked like only half height at two points along the deck and there was a sharp
bowsprit stabbing ahead of the slimly tapered prow. This was a yacht. A rich
man's floating home.
Light spilled out of a hatchway on the rear deck and Ortega emerged far enough
to beckon me down from the landing pad. Hooking my fingers firmly on the rail,
I braced myself against the pitch and sway of the vessel and picked my way
down a short flight of steps at one side of the pad, then across the rear deck to
the hatch. Swirls of drizzle swept across the ship, hurrying me along against my
will. In the well of light from the open hatch I saw another, steeper set of steps
and handed my way down the narrow companionway into the offered warmth.
Over my head, the hatch hummed smoothly shut.
'Where the fuck have you been?' snapped Ortega.
I took a moment to rub some of the water out of my hair and looked around. If
this was a rich man's floating home, the rich man in question hadn't been home
in a while. Furniture was stowed at the sides of the room I had descended into,
sheeted over in semi-opaque plastic, and the shelves of the small niche bar were
empty. The hatches over the windows were all battened down. Doors at either
end of the room were open onto what: seemed to be similarly mothballed spaces.
For all that, the yacht reeked of the wealth that had spawned it. The chairs and
tables beneath the plastic were darkly polished wood, as was the panelling of the
bulkheads and doors, and there were rugs on the waxed boards beneath my feet.
The remainder of the decor was similarly sombre in tone, with what looked like
original artwork on the bulkhead walls. One from the Empathist school, the
skeletal ruins of a Martian shipyard at sunset, the other an abstract that I didn't
have the cultural background to read.
Ortega stood in the middle of it all, tousle-haired and scowling in a raw silk
kimono that I assumed had come out of an onboard wardrobe.
'It's a long story.' I moved past her to peer through the nearest door. 'I could use a
coffee, if the galley's open.'
Bedroom. A big, oval bed set amidst less than wholly tasteful mirrors, quilt
tangled and thrown aside in haste. I was moving back towards the other door

when she slapped me.
I reeled sideways. It wasn't as hard a blow as I'd given Sullivan in the noodle
house, but it was delivered from standing with a lot more swing and there was
the tilt of the deck to contend with. The cocktail of hangover and painkillers
didn't help. I didn't quite go down, but it was a near thing. Stumbling back into
balance, I raised a hand to my cheek and stared at Ortega, who was glaring back
at me with twin spots of colour burning high on each cheekbone.
'Look, I'm sorry if I woke you up, but — '
'You piece of shit,' she hissed at me. 'You lying piece of shit.'
'I'm not sure I — '
'I should have you fucking arrested, Kovacs. I should have you fucking stacked
for what you've done.'
I started to lose my temper. 'Done what? Will you get a fucking grip, Ortega, and
tell me what's going on.'
'We accessed the Hendrix's memory today,' Ortega said coldly. 'Preliminary
warrant went through at noon. Everything for the last week. I've been reviewing
it.'
The rapidly flaring, irritable rage shrank back to nothing inside me as the words
left her mouth. It was as if she'd emptied a bucket of seawater over my head.
'Oh.'
'Yes, there wasn't much.' Ortega turned away, hugging her own shoulders in the
kimono, and moved past me to the unexplored doorway. 'You're the only guest
there at the moment. So it's just been you. And your visitors.'
I followed her through into a second, carpeted room where two steps led down to
a narrow sunken galley behind a low, wood-panelled partition at one side. The
other walls held similarly covered items of furniture to the first room, except for
the far corner, where the plastic sheeting had been pulled off a metre-square
video screen and attendant receiver/playback modules. A single, straight-backed
chair was positioned in front of the screen on which was frozen the unmistakable

image of Elias Ryker's face delving between Miriam Bancroft's widespread
thighs.
'There's a remote on the chair,' said Ortega, herself remote. 'Why don't you watch
some of it while I make you a coffee? Refresh your memory. Then you can do
some explaining.'
She disappeared into the galley without giving me the chance to reply. I
advanced on the frozen video screen, feeling a small liquid slide in my guts as
the image brought back memories tinged with Merge Nine. In the sleepless,
chaotic whirl of the last day and a half, I had all but forgotten Miriam Bancroft,
but now she came back to me in the flesh, overpowering and intoxicating as she
had been that night. I'd also forgotten Rodrigo Bautista's claim that they were
almost through the legal wrangles with the Hendrix's lawyers.
My foot knocked against something and I looked down at the carpet. There was
a coffee mug on the floor next to the chair, still a third full. I wondered how
much of the hotel's memory Ortega had gone through. I glanced at the image on
screen. Was this as far as she'd got? What else had she seen? How to play this,
then? I picked up the remote and turned it over in my hands. Ortega's cooperation had been an integral part of my planning so far. If I was going to lose
her now, I was in trouble.
Scratching around inside me was something else. An emotional upwelling that I
didn't want to acknowledge, because to acknowledge it would be a clinical
absurdity. A feeling that, despite my preoccupation with later factors in the
hotel's memory, was tied intimately to the image currently on screen.
Embarrassment. Shame.
Absurd. I shook my head. Fucking stupid.
'You're not watching.'
I turned back and saw Ortega with a steaming mug in each hand. An aroma of
mingled coffee and rum wafted towards me.
'Thanks.' I took one of the mugs from her and sipped at it, playing for time. She
leaned away from me and folded her arms.

'So. Half a hundred reasons why Miriam Bancroft doesn't fit the bill.' She jerked
her head at the screen. 'How many of them is that?'
'Ortega, this is nothing to do — '
'I buy Miriam Bancroft as scary, you told me.' She shook her head judicially and
sipped from her coffee. 'I don't know, that doesn't look like fear on your face,
exactly.'
'Ortega — '
' "I want you to stop," she says. She actually says it, look wind it back if you
don't rememb — '
I pulled the remote out of her reach. 'I remember what she said.'
'Then you also remember the sweet little deal she offered you to shut down the
case, the multiple — '
'Ortega, you didn't want me on the case either, remember. Open and shut suicide,
you said. That doesn't mean you killed him, does — '
'Shut up.' Ortega circled me as if we were holding knives, not coffee mugs.
'You've been covering for her. All this fucking time, you've had your nose buried
in her crotch like a faithful fucking d — '
'If you've seen the rest of it, you know that isn't true.' I tried for an even tone that
Ryker's hormones would not let me have. 'I told Curtis I wasn't interested. I
fucking told him that two days ago.'
'Do you have any idea what a prosecutor will do with this footage? Miriam
Bancroft trying to buy off her husband's investigator with illegal sexual favours.
Oh yes, admission of multiple sleeving, even unproven, can be made to look
very bad in court.'
'She'll beat the rap. You know she will.'
'If her Meth husband wants to weigh in on her side. Which maybe he won't when
he sees this. This isn't Leila Begin again, you know. The moral boot's on the
other foot this time around.'

The allusion to morality went ripping through the outer borders of the argument,
but as it passed I grasped the uncomfortable fact that actually it was central to
what was going on here. I remembered Bancroft's critical assessment of Earth's
moral culture, and wondered if he could really watch my head between his wife's
thighs and not feel betrayed.
I was still trying to work out what I felt on the same subject.
'And while we're on the subject of prosecution, Kovacs, that severed head you
brought back from the Wei Clinic isn't going to win you any remissions either.
Illegal retention of a d.h. personality carries fifty to a hundred on Earth, more if
we can prove you torched the head off in the first place.'
'I was going to tell you about that.'
'No, you fucking weren't,' Ortega snarled. 'You weren't going to fucking tell me
any single thing you didn't need to.'
'Look, the clinic won't dare prosecute anyway. They've got too much to — '
'You arrogant motherfucker.' The coffee cup thumped dully to the carpet, and her
fists clenched. Now there was real fury in her eyes. 'You're just like him, you're
just fucking like him. You think we need the nicking clinic, with footage of you
putting a severed head in a hotel freezer. Isn't that a crime where you come from,
Kovacs? Summary decapitation — '
'Wait a minute.' I put my own coffee down on the chair at my side. 'Just like
who, who am I just like?'
'What?'
'You just said I'm just — '
'Never fucking mind what I said. Do you understand what you've done here,
Kovacs?'
'The only thing I under — ' Abruptly, sound welled from the screen behind me,
liquid groans and the sound of organic suction. I glanced at the remote clenched
in my left hand, trying to see how I'd inadvertently unfrozen the playback, and a
deep, female moan sent the blood twitching through my guts. Then Ortega was

on me, trying to snatch the remote out of my hand.
'Give me that, turn that fucking thing — '
For a moment I wrestled with her and our struggling only succeeded in making
the volume louder. Then, suddenly, riding a solitary updraft of sanity, I let go and
she collapsed against the chair, pressing buttons.
' — off.'
There was a long silence, punctuated only by our own heavy breathing. I fixed
my gaze on one of the battened-down viewports across the room, Ortega,
slumped between my leg and the chair, was presumably still looking at the
screen. I thought that, for a moment, our breathing matched pace.
When I turned and bent to help her up, she was already rising towards me. Our
hands were on each other, I think, before either of us realised what was
happening.
It was like resolution. The circling antagonisms collapsed inward like orbitals
crashing and burning, surrendering to a mutual gravity that had dragged like
chains while it endured but in release was a streak of fire through the nerves. We
were both trying to kiss each other and laugh at the same time. Ortega made
excited little panting sounds as my hands slipped inside the kimono, palms
skidding over coarse nipples as broad and stiff as rope-ends and the breasts that
fitted into my hands as if designed to nestle there. The kimono came off, sliding
at first and then jerked insistently free of each swimmer's shoulder in turn. I shed
jacket and shirt in one, while Ortega's hands tangled frantically at my belt,
opening the fly and sliding one hard, long-fingered hand into the gap. I felt the
calluses at the base of each finger, rubbing.
Somehow we got out of the room with the screen, and made it to the stern-end
cabin I'd seen earlier. I followed the taut sway of Ortega's strides across the room
between, the muscled lines of the long thighs, and it must have been Ryker as
much as me, because I felt like a man coming home. There, in the room full of
mirrors, she threw her head down on the disarrayed sheets, lifted herself up and I
saw myself slide into her up to the hilt, with a gasp because now she was
burning. She was burning inside, gripping me with the liquid entirety of hot bath
water, and the heated globes of her buttocks branded my hips with the impact of
each stroke. Ahead of me, her spine lifted and wove like a snake and her hair

cascaded down from her bent head in a chaotic elegance. In the mirrors around
me I saw Ryker reaching forward to cup her breasts, then the breadth of her ribs,
the rounding of her shoulders, and all the while she lifted and yawed like the
ocean around the ship. Ryker and Ortega, writhing against each other like the
reunited lovers of a timeless epic.
I felt the first climax go through her, but it was the sight of her looking back at
me, up through tumbled hair, lips parted, that slipped the final catches on my
own control and moulded me against the contours of her back and ass until my
spasms were all spent inside her arid we collapsed across the bed. I felt myself
slide out of her like something being born. I think she was still coming.
Neither of us said anything for a long time. The ship ploughed on its automated
way and around us the dangerous cold of the mirrors lapped inwards like an icy
tide, threatening to tinge, and then drown the intimacy. In a few moments we
would be fixing our gazes carefully outwards on the images of ourselves, instead
of on each other.
I slid an arm around Ortega's flank and tilted her gently onto one side, so that we
lay like spoons. In the mirror, I found her eyes.
'Where're we going?' I asked her gently.
A shrug, but she used it to snuggle deeper into me. 'Programmed cycle, down the
coast, out to Hawaii, hook around and then back.'
'And no one knows we're out here?'
'Only the satellites.'
'Nice thought. Who does it all belong to it?'
She twisted to look at me over her shoulder. 'It's Ryker's.'
'Ooops.' I looked elaborately away. 'Nice carpet in here.'
Against the odds, it brought a laugh out of her. She turned fully to face me in the
bed. Her hand rose to touch my face softly, as if she thought it might mark easily,
or maybe disappear.

'I told myself,' she murmured, 'it was crazy. It was just the body, you know.'
'Most things are. Conscious thought doesn't have much to do with this stuff.
Doesn't have much to do with the way we live our lives, full stop, if you believe
the psychologists. A bit of rationalisation, most of it with hindsight. Put the rest
down to hormonal drives, gene instinct and pheromones for the fine tuning. Sad,
but true.'
Her finger followed a line down the side of my face. 'I don't think it's sad. What
we've done with the rest of ourselves, that's sad.'
'Kristin Ortega.' I took hold of her finger and squeezed it gently. 'You are a real
fucking Luddite, aren't you. How in God's name did you get into this line of
work?'
She shrugged again. 'Family of cops. Father was a cop. Grandmother was a cop.
You know how it goes.'
'Not from experience.'
'No.' She stretched one long leg languidly up towards the mirrored ceiling. 'I
guess not.'
I reached across the plain of her belly and slid my hand along the length of thigh
to the knee, levering her gently over and bringing my mouth to kiss gently at the
shaved bar of pubic hair where it descended into cleft. She resisted fractionally,
maybe thinking of the screen in the other room, or maybe just our mingled juices
trickling from her body, then relented and spread herself under me. I shifted her
other thigh up over my shoulder and lowered my face into her.
This time, when she came, it was with escalating cries that she locked in her
throat each time with powerful flexings of the muscles at the base of her stomach
while her whole body eeled back and forth across the bed and her hips bucked
upward, grinding the soft flesh into my mouth. At some point she had lapsed into
softly uttered Spanish, whose tones stoked my own arousal, and when she finally
flopped to stillness, I was able to slide up and into her directly, gathering her
under the arms and sinking my tongue into her mouth in the first kiss we'd
shared since reaching the bed.
We moved slowly, trying for the rhythm of the sea outside and the laughter of

our first embrace. It seemed to last a long time, time for talking, up the scale
from languid murmurs to excited gabbling, for shifts in posture and soft bitings,
the clasping of hands, and all the time a feeling of brimming to overflow that
hurt my eyes. It was from that last, unbearable pressure as much as any that I
finally let go and came into her, feeling her chase the last of my fading hardness
to her own shaking finish.
In the Envoy Corps, you take what is offered, said Virginia Vidaura, somewhere
in the corridors of my memory. And that must sometimes be enough.
As we separated for the second time, the weight of the last twenty-four hours
came down on me like one of the heavy rugs in the other room and
consciousness slipped gradually away from the increasing warmth beneath it.
My last clear impressions were of the long body beside me rearranging itself
with breasts pressed into my back, an arm draped over me and a peculiarly
comfortable clasping of feet, mine in hers, like hands. My thought processes
were slowing down.
What is offered. Sometimes. Enough.

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

When I awoke, she was gone.
There was sunlight coming into the cabin from a number of unbattened
viewports. The pitching of the boat had almost stopped but there was still
enough roll to show me, alternately, a blue sky with horizontal scrapings of
cloud and a reasonably calm sea beneath. Somewhere, someone was making
coffee and frying smoked meat. I lay still for a while, picking up the scattered
garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from
them. What to tell Ortega? How much, and weighted how? The Envoy
conditioning offered itself sluggishly, like something dredged out of a swamp. I
let it roll over and sink, absorbed in the dappling of sunbeams on the sheets near
my head.
The clinking of glasses from the door brought me round. Ortega was standing in
the doorway wearing a NO TO RESOLUTION 653 T-shirt on which the NO had
been stylistically daubed out with a red cross and overwritten with a definitive
YES in the same colour. The columns of her naked legs disappeared under the Tshirt as if they might conceivably go on for ever inside. Balanced in her hands
was a large tray laden with breakfast for an entire squadroom. Seeing me awake,
she tossed hair out of her eyes and grinned crookedly.
So I told her everything.

'So what are you going to do?'
I shrugged and stared out across the water, narrowing my eyes against the glare.
The ocean seemed flatter, more ponderous than it does on Harlan's World. Up on
deck, the immensity of it sank in and the yacht was suddenly a child's toy. 'I'm
going to do what Kawahara wants. What Miriam Bancroft wants. What you
want. What apparently everyone fucking wants. I'm going to kill the case.'
'You think Kawahara torched Bancroft?'
'Seems likely. Or she's shielding someone who did. Doesn't matter anymore.
She's got Sarah, that's all that counts now.'
'We could hit her with abduction charges. Retention of d.h. personality carries —
'
'Fifty to a hundred, yeah.' I smiled faintly. 'I was listening last night. But she
won't be holding directly, it'll be some subsidiary.'
'We can get warrants that — '
'She's a fucking Meth, Kristin. She'll beat it all without raising her pulse.
Anyway, that's not the issue here. As soon as I move against her, she'll slam
Sarah into virtual. How long do your far-ranging warrants take to get clearance?'
'Couple of days, if it's UN-expedited.' The gloom crept across Ortega's face as
she was saying it. She leaned on the rail and stared downwards.
'Exactly. That's the best part of a year in virtual. Sarah isn't an Envoy, she doesn't
have any kind of conditioning. What Kawahara can do to her in eight or nine
virtual months would turn a normal mind into pulp. She'd be screaming insane
by the time we pulled her out. If we pulled her out, and anyway I'm not going to
even fucking consider putting her through a single second of — '
'OK.' Ortega put a hand on my shoulder. 'OK. I'm sorry.'
I shivered slightly, whether from the sea wind or the thought of Kawahara's
virtual dungeons I couldn't be sure.

'Forget it.'
'I'm a cop. It's in my nature to look for ways to bust the bad guys. That's all.'
I looked up and gave her a bleak smile. 'I'm an Envoy. It's in my nature to look
for ways to rip Kavrahara's throat out. I've looked. There are no ways.'
The smile she gave me back was uneasy, tinged with an ambivalence that I knew
was going to get us sooner or later.
'Look, Kristin. I've found a way to do this. To lie convincingly to Bancroft and
shut the case down. It's illegal, very illegal, but no one that matters gets hurt. I
don't have to tell you about it. If you don't want to know.'
She thought about it for a while, eyes probing the water alongside the yacht, as if
the answer might be swimming there, keeping pace with us. I wandered along
the rail to give her time, tilting my head back to scan the blue bowl of the sky
overhead and thinking about orbital surveillance systems. Out in the middle of a
seemingly endless ocean, cocooned in the high-tech safety of the yacht, it was
easy to believe you could hide from the Kawaharas and Bancrofts of this world,
but that kind of hiding died centuries ago.
If they want you, a youngish Quell had once written of the Harlan's World ruling
elite, sooner or later they'll scoop you up off the globe, like specks of interesting
dust off a Martian artefact. Cross the gulf between the stars, and they can come
after you. Go into centuries of storage, and they'll be there waiting for you,
clone-new, when you re-sleeve. They are what we once dreamed of as gods,
mythical agents of destiny, as inescapable as Death, that poor old peasant
labourer, bent over his scythe, no longer is. Poor Death, no match for the mighty
altered carbon technologies of data storage and retrieval arrayed against him.
Once -we lived in terror of his arrival. Now we flirt outrageously with his
sombre dignity, and beings like these won't even let him in the tradesman's
entrance.
I grimaced. Compared to Kawahara, Death was a three-bout pushover.
I stopped at the prow and picked a point on the horizon to watch until Ortega
made up her mind.
Suppose you know someone, a long time ago. You share things, drink deeply of

each other. Then you drift apart, life takes you in different directions, the bonds
are not strong enough. Or maybe you get torn apart by external circumstance.
Years later, you meet that person again, in the same sleeve, and you go through it
all over again. What's the attraction? Is this the same person? They probably
have the same name, the same approximate physical appearance, but does that
make them the same? And if not, does that make the things that have changed
unimportant or peripheral? People change, but how much? As a child I'd
believed there was an essential person, a sort of core personality around which
the surface factors could evolve and change without damaging the integrity of
who you were. Later, I started to see that this was an error of perception caused
by the metaphors we were used to framing ourselves in. What we thought of as
personality was no more than the passing shape of one of the waves in front of
me. Or, slowing it down to more human speed, the shape of a sand dune. Form
in response to stimulus. Wind, gravity, upbringing. Gene blueprinting. All
subject to erosion and change. The only way to beat that was to go on stack
forever.
Just as a primitive sextant functions on the illusion that the sun and stars rotate
around the planet -we are standing on, our senses give us the illusion of stability
in the universe, and we accept it, because without that acceptance, nothing can
be done.
Virginia Vidaura, pacing the seminar room, lost in lecture mode.
But the fact that a sextant will let you navigate accurately across an ocean does
not mean that the sun and stars do rotate around us. For all that we have done,
as a civilisation, as individuals, the universe is not stable, and nor is any single
thing within it. Stars consume themselves, the universe itself rushes apart, and
we ourselves are composed of matter in constant flux. Colonies of cells in
temporary alliance, replicating and decaying and housed within, an
incandescent cloud of electrical impulse and precariously stacked carbon code
memory. This is reality, this is self knowledge, and the perception of it will, of
course, make you dizzy. Some of you have served in Vacuum Command, and -will
no doubt think that out there you have confronted existence vertigo.
A thin smile.
I promise you that the Zen moments you may have enjoyed in hard space are not
much more than the beginning of what you must learn here. All and anything you

achieve as Envoys must be based on the understanding that there is nothing but
flux. Anything you wish to even perceive as an Envoy, let alone create or
achieve, must be carved out of that flux.
I wish you all luck.
If you couldn't even meet the same person twice in one lifetime, in one sleeve,
what did that say about all the families and friends waiting in Download Central
for someone they once knew to peer out through the eyes of a stranger. How
could that even be close to the same person?
And where did that leave a woman consumed with passion for a stranger
wearing a body she once loved. Was that closer, or further away?
Where, for that matter, did it leave the stranger who responded?
I heard her coming along the rail towards me. She stopped a couple of paces
away and cleared her throat quietly. I quelled a smile, and turned round.
'I didn't tell you how Ryker came to have all this, did I?'
'It didn't seem the time to ask.'
'No.' A grin that faded as if swept away by the breeze. 'He stole it. A few years
back, while he was still working Sleeve Theft. Belonged to some big-time clone
marketeer from Sydney. Ryker caught the case because this guy was moving
broken-down merchandise through the West Coast clinics. He got co-opted into
a local taskforce and they tried to take the guy down at his marina. Big firefight,
lots of dead people.'
'And lots of spoils.'
She nodded. 'They do things differently down there. Most of the police work
gets picked up by private contractors. The local government handle it by tying
payment to the assets of the criminals you bring down.'
'Interesting incentive,' I said reflectively. 'Ought to make for a lot of rich people
getting busted.'
'Yeah, they say it works that way. The yacht was Ryker's piece. He did a lot of

the groundwork on the case, and he was wounded in the firefight.' Her voice was
curiously undefensive as she related these details, and for once I felt that Ryker
was a long way away. 'That's where he got the scar under the eye, that stuff on
his arm. Cable gun.'
'Nasty.' Despite myself, I felt a slight twinge in the scarred arm. I'd been up
against cable fire before, and not enjoyed the encounter very much.
'Right. Most people reckoned Ryker earned every rivet of this boat. The point is,
policy here in Bay City is that officers may not keep gifts, bonuses or anything
else awarded for line-of-duty actions.'
'I can see the rationale for that.'
'Yeah, so can I. But Ryker couldn't. He paid some cut-rate Dipper to lose the
ship's records and reregister her through discreet holding. Claimed he needed a
safe house, if he ever had to stash someone.'
I grinned a little. 'Thin. But I like his style. Would that be the same Dipper who
ratted him out in Seattle?'
'Good memory you've got. Yeah, the very same. Nacho the Needle. Bautista tells
a well-balanced story, doesn't he?'
'Saw that too, huh?'
'Yeah. Ordinarily, I'd have ripped Bautista's fucking head off for that paternal
uncle shit. Like I need emotional sheltering, he's been through two fucking
divorces and he's not even forty yet.' She stared reflectively out to sea. 'I haven't
had the time to confront him yet. Too busy being fucked off with you. Look,
Kovacs, reason I'm telling you all this is, Ryker stole the boat, he broke West
Coast law. I knew.'
'And you didn't do anything,' I guessed.
'Nothing.' She looked at her hands, palms upturned. 'Oh, shit, Kovacs, who are
we kidding? I'm no angel myself. I kicked the shit out of Kadmin in police
custody. You saw me. I should have busted you for that fight outside Jerry's and I
let you walk.'

'You were too tired for the paperwork, as I recall.'
'Yeah, I remember.' She grimaced, then turned to look me in the eyes, searching
Ryker's face for a sign that she could trust me. 'You say you're going to break the
law, but no one gets hurt. That's right?'
'No one who matters,' I corrected gently.
She nodded slowly to herself, like someone weighing up a convincing argument
that may just change their mind for good.
'So what do you need?'
I levered myself off the rail. 'A list of whorehouses in the Bay City area, to start
with. Places that run virtual stuff. After that, we'd better get back to town. I don't
want to call Kawahara from out here.'
She blinked. 'Virtual whorehouses?'
'Yeah. And the mixed ones as well. In fact, make it every place on the West
Coast that runs virtual porn. The lower grade the better. I'm going to sell
Bancroft a package so filthy he won't want to look at it close enough to check for
cracks. So bad he won't even want to think about it.'

CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

Ortega's list was over two thousand names long, each annotated with a brief
surveillance report and any Organic-Damage convictions tied to the operators or
clientele. In hardcopy format it ran to about two hundred concertina'd sheets,
which started to unravel like a long paper scarf as soon as I got past page one. I
tried to scan the list in the cab back to Bay City, but gave up when it threatened
to overwhelm us both on the back seat. I wasn't in the mood anyway. Most of me
wished I was still bedded down in the stern cabin of Ryker's yacht, isolated from
the rest of humanity and its problems by hundreds of kilometres of trackless
blue.
Back at the Watchtower suite, I put Ortega in the kitchen while I called
Kawahara at the number Trepp had given me. It was Trepp that came on screen
first, features smeared with sleep. I wondered if she'd been up all night trying to
track me.
'Morning.' She yawned and presumably checked an internal timechip.
'Afternoon, I mean. Where've you been?'
'Out and about.'
Trepp rubbed inelegantly at one eye and yawned again. 'Suit yourself. Just
making conversation. How's your head?'
'Better, thanks. I want to talk to Kawahara.'

'Sure.' She reached towards the screen. 'Talk to you later.'
The screen dropped into neutral, an unwinding tricoloured helix accompanied by
sickly sweet string arrangements. I gritted my teeth.
'Takeshi-san.' As always, Kawahara started in Japanese, as if it established some
kind of common ground with me. 'This is unlooked-for so early. Do you have
good news for me?'
I stayed doggedly in Amanglic. 'Is this a secure line?'
'As close as such a thing can be said to exist, yes.'
'I have a shopping list.'
'Go ahead.'
'To begin with, I need access to a military virus. Rawling 4851 for preference, or
one of the Condomar variants.'
Kawahara's intelligent features hardened abruptly. 'The Innenin virus?'
'Yeah. It's over a century out of date now, shouldn't be too hard to get hold of.
Then I need — '
'Kovacs, I think you'd better explain what you're planning.'
I raised an eyebrow. 'I understood this was my play, and you didn't want to be
involved.'
'If I secure you a copy of the Rawling virus, I'd say I'm already involved.'
Kawahara offered me a measured smile. 'Now what are you planning to do with
it?'
'Bancroft killed himself, that's the result you want, right?'
A slow nod.
'Then there has to be a reason,' I said, warming to the deceit structure I'd come
up with, despite myself. I was doing what they'd trained me to do, and it felt
good. 'Bancroft has remote storage, it doesn't make sense that he'd light himself

up unless he had a very specific reason. A reason unrelated to the actual act of
suicide. A reason like self preservation.'
Kawahara's eyes narrowed. 'Go on.'
'Bancroft uses whorehouses on a regular basis, real and virtual. He told me that
himself a couple of days ago. And he's not too particular about the quality of
establishment he uses either. Now, let's assume that there's an accident in one of
these virtuals while he's getting his itch scratched. Accidental bleedover from
some grimed-up old programs that no one's bothered to even open for a few
decades. Go to a low enough grade of house, there's no telling what might be
lying around.'
'The Rawling virus.' Kawahara exhaled as if she had been holding her breath in
anticipation.
'Rawling variant 4851 takes about a hundred minutes to go fully active, by which
time it's too late to do anything.' I forced images of Jimmy de Soto from my
mind. 'The target's contaminated beyond redemption. Suppose Bancroft finds
this out through some kind of systems warning. He must be wired internally for
that kind of thing. He suddenly discovers the stack he's wearing and the brain it's
wired to is burnt. That's not a disaster, if you've got clone backup and remote
storage, but — '
'Transmission.' Kawahara's face lit up as she got it.
'Right. He'd have to do something to stop the virus being 'cast to the remote with
the rest of his personality. With the next needlecast coming up that night, maybe
in a few minutes' time, there was only one way to ensure the remote stack didn't
get contaminated.'
I mimed a pistol at my head.
'Ingenious.'
'That's why he made the call, the timecheck. He couldn't trust his own internal
chip, the virus might already have scrambled it.'
Solemnly, Kawahara lifted her hands into view and applauded. When she had
finished, she clasped her hands together and looked at me over them.

'Very impressive. I will obtain the Rawling virus immediately. Have you selected
a suitable virtual house for it to be downloaded into?'
'Not yet. The virus isn't the only thing I need. I want you to arrange the parole
and re-sleeving of Irene Elliott, currently held at Bay City Central on conviction
of Dipping. I also want you to look into the possibility of acquiring her original
sleeve back from its purchasers. Some corporate deal, there'll be records.'
'You're going to use this Elliott to download Rawling?'
'The evidence is she's good.'
'The evidence is she got caught,' observed Kawahara tartly. 'I've got plenty of
people can do this for you. Top line intrusion specialists. You don't need — '
'Kawahara.' I kept my temper with an effort, but heard some of it in the tightness
in my voice. 'This is my gig, remember. I don't want your people climbing all
over it. If you unstack Elliott, she'll be loyal. Get her her own body back and
she'll be ours for life. That's the way I want to do it, so that's the way it's going
down.'
I waited. Kawahara stayed expressionless for a moment, then bestowed on me
another carefully calibrated smile.
'Very well. We will do it your way. I'm sure you're aware of the risks you are
taking, and what will happen if you fail. I shall contact you at the Hendrix later
today.'
'What's the word on Kadmin?'
'Of Kadmin, there is no word.' Kawahara smiled once more, and the connection
broke.
I sat staring at the standby screen for a moment, reviewing the scam as I'd laid it
out. I had the uneasy feeling that I'd been telling the truth in the midst of all the
deceit. Or, more, that my carefully spun lies were treading in the tracks of the
truth, following the same path. A good lie should shadow the truth closely
enough to draw substance from it, but this was something else, something
altogether more unnerving. I felt like a hunter who has tracked a swamp panther
a little too close for comfort, and expects at any moment to see it rear up out of

the swamp in all its fanged and tendril-maned horror. The truth was here,
somewhere.
It was a hard feeling to shake.
I got up and went into the kitchen, where Ortega was foraging through the
almost empty fridge unit. Light: from within cast her features in a way I hadn't
seen before and below one raised arm her right breast filled the slack of her Tshirt like fruit, like water. The desire to touch her was an itching in my hands.
She glanced up. 'Don't you cook?'
'Hotel does it all for you. Comes up in the hatch. What do you want?'
'I want to cook something.' She gave up looking through the fridge and closed
the door of the unit. 'Get what you wanted?'
'Think so. Give the hotel a list of ingredients. There are pans and things in that
rack down there, I think. Anything else you need, ask the hotel. I'm going to go
through the list. Oh, and Kristin.'
She looked round from the rack I'd indicated.
'Miller's head isn't in here. I put it next door.'
Her mouth tightened a little. 'I know where you put Miller's head,' she said. 'I
wasn't looking for it.'
A couple of minutes later, seated on the window shelf with the hardcopy
unfolding away to the floor, I heard the low tones of Ortega conversing with the
Hendrix. There was some banging about, more muted conversation, and then the
sound of oil frying gently. I fought off the urge for a cigarette and bent my head
to the hardcopy.
I was looking for something that I'd seen every day of my young life in Newpest;
the places I'd spent my teenage years, the narrow accessways of tiny properties
sporting cheap holos that promised things like Better than the Real Thing, Wide
Range of Scenarios and Dreams Come True. It didn't take much to set up a
virtual brothel. You just needed frontage and space for the client coffins stacked
upright. The software varied in price, depending on how-elaborate and original it

was, but the machines to run it could usually be bought out of military surplus at
basement rates.
If Bancroft could spend time and money in Jerry's biocabins, he'd be at home in
one of these.
I was two thirds of my way through the list, more and more of my attention
sifting away to the aromas issuing from the kitchen, when my eyes fell on a
familiar entry and I grew abruptly still.
I saw a woman with long, straight black hair and crimson lips
I heard Trepp's voice
. . . head in the clouds. I want to be there before midnight.
And the bar-coded chauffeur
No problem. Coastal's running light tonight.
And the crimson-lipped woman
Head in the clouds. This is what it's like. Maybe you can't afford to come up
here.
A choir in climax
from the Houses, from the Houses, from the Houses . . .
And the businesslike printout in my hands
Head in the Clouds: accredited West Coast House, real and virtual product,
mobile aerial site outside coastal limit. . .
I scanned through the notes, head ringing as if it were crystal that had been
delicately struck with a hammer.
Navigational beams and beaconing system locked to Bay City and Seattle.

I sat still, thinking.
There were pieces missing. It was like the mirror, wedged into place on jagged
edges, enough to hold an image, but not the whole. I was peering hard at the
irregular limits of what I had, trying to see round the edges, to get the backdrop.
Trepp had been taking me to see Ray — Reileen — at Head in the Clouds. Not
Europe, Europe was a blind, the sombre weight of the basilica designed to numb
me to what should have been obvious. If Kawahara was involved in this thing,
she wouldn't be overseeing it from half a globe away. Kawahara was on Head in
the Clouds, and . . .
And what?
Envoy intuition was a form of subliminal recognition, an enhanced awareness of
pattern that the real world too often abraded with its demand for detailed focus.
Given enough traces of continuity, you could make a leap that enabled you to see
the whole as a kind of premonition of real knowledge. Working from that model,
you could fill in the bits later. But there was a certain minimum you needed to
get airborne. Like old-style linear prop aircraft, you needed a run up, and I didn't
have it. I could feel myself bumping along the ground, clawing at the air and
falling back. Not enough.
'Kovacs?'
I glanced up, and saw it. Like a head-up display coming on line, like airlock
bolts slamming back in my head.
Ortega stood before me, a stirring implement in one hand, hair gathered back in
a loose knot. Her T-shirt blazoned at me.
RESOLUTION 653. Yes or No, depending.
Oumou Prescott
Mr Bancroft has an undeclared influence in the UN Court.

Head in the Clouds.
It was a process that could not be braked, a kind of mental avalanche. Chunks of
reality splintering away and tumbling downward, except that instead of chaos
they were falling into something that had form, a kind of restructured whole
whose final shape I still couldn't make out.
Beaconing system locked to Bay City —
— and Seattle
Bautista.
See, it all went down in a black clinic up in Seattle.
The intacts ditched in the Pacific.
Ortega's theory was that Ryker was set up.
'What're you looking at?'
The words hung in the air for a moment like a hinge in time, and suddenly time
hinged back and in the doorway behind, Sarah was just waking up in the
Millsport hotel bed, with the rolling thunder of an orbital discharge rattling the
loose windows in their frames and behind that, rotorblades against the night, and
our own deaths waiting just up around the bend.
'What're you looking at?'
I blinked and I was still staring at Ortega's T-shirt, at the soft mounds she made
in it and the legend printed across the chest. There was a slight smile on her face,

but it was beginning to bleach out with concern.
'Kovacs?'
I blinked again and tried to reel in the metres of mental spillage that the T-shirt
had set off. The looming truth of Head in the Clouds.
'Are you OK?'
'Yeah.'
'Want to eat?'
'Ortega, what if — ' I found I had to clear my throat, swallow and start again. I
didn't want to say this, my body didn't want me to say it. 'What if I can get Ryker
off the stack? Permanently, I mean. Clear him of the charges, prove Seattle was a
set-up. What's that worth to you?'
For a moment, she looked at me as if I was speaking a language she didn't
understand. Then she moved to the window shelf and seated herself carefully on
the edge, facing me. She was silent for a while, but I had already seen the answer
in her eyes.
'Are you feeling guilty?' she asked me finally.
'About?'
'About us.'
I nearly laughed out loud, but there was just enough underlying pain to stop the
reflex in my throat. The urge to touch her had not stopped. Over the last day it
had ebbed and flowed in waves, but it had never wholly gone. When I looked at
the curve of her hips and thighs on the window shelf, I could feel the way she
had writhed back against me so clearly it was almost virtual. My palm recalled
the weight and shape of her breast as if holding it had been this sleeve's life's
work. As I looked at her, my fingers wanted to trace the geometry of her face.
There was no room in me for guilt, no room for anything but this feeling.
'Envoys don't feel guilt,' I said shortly. 'I'm serious. It's likely, no it's almost
certain in fact that Kawahara had Ryker set up because he was heating up the

Mary Lou Hinchley case too much. Do you remember anything about her
employment records?'
Ortega thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. 'She ran away from home
to be with the boyfriend. Mostly unregistered stuff, anything to bring the rent in.
Boyfriend was a piece of shit, got a record goes back to age fifteen. He dealt a
little Stiff, crashed a few easy datastacks, mostly lived off his women.'
'Would he have let her work the Meat Rack? Or the cabins?'
'Oh, yeah.' Ortega nodded, face stony. 'Soon as spit.'
'If someone was recruiting for a snuff house, Catholics would be the ideal
candidates, wouldn't they? They're not going to tell any tales after the event,
after all. By reasons of conscience.'
'Snuff.' If Ortega's face had been stony before, it was weathered granite now.
'Most of the snuff 'victims around here just get a bolt through the stack when it's
over. They don't tell any tales.'
'Right. But what if something went wrong. Specifically, what if Mary Lou
Hinchley was going to be used as a snuff whore, so she tried to escape and fell
out of an aerial whorehouse called Head in the Clouds. That would make her
Catholicism very convenient, wouldn't it?'
'Head in the Clouds? Are you serious?'
'And it'd make the owners of Head in the Clouds very anxious to stop Resolution
653 dead in its tracks, wouldn't it?'
'Kovacs.' Ortega was making slow-down gestures with both palms. 'Kovacs,
Head in the Clouds is one of the Houses. Class prostitution. I don't like those
places, they make me want to vomit just as bad as the cabins, but they're clean.
They cater for elevated society and they don't run scams like snuff — '
'You don't think the upper echelons go in for sadism and necrophilia, then. That's
strictly a lower-class thing, is it?'
'No, it isn't,' said Ortega evenly. 'But if anyone with money wants to play at
torturer, they can afford to do it in virtual. Some of the Houses run virtual snuff,

but they run it because it's legal, and there's nothing we can do about it. And
that's the way they like it.'
I drew a deep breath. 'Kristin, someone was taking me to see Kawahara on board
Head in the Clouds. Someone from the Wei Clinic. And if Kawahara is involved
in the West Coast Houses, then they will do anything that turns a profit, because
she will do anything, anything at all. You wanted a big bad Meth to believe in?
Forget Bancroft, he's practically a priest in comparison. Kawahara grew up in
Fission City, dealing anti-radiation drugs to the families of fuel rod workers. Do
you know what a water carrier is?'
She shook her head.
'In Fission City it's what they used to call the gang enforcers. See, if someone
refused to pay protection, or informed to the police, or just didn't jump fast
enough when the local yakuza boss said frog, the standard punishment was to
drink contaminated water. The enforcers used to carry it around in shielded
flasks, siphoned off low-grade reactor cooling systems. They'd turn up at the
offender's house one night and tell him how much he had to drink. His family
would be made to watch. If he didn't drink, they'd start cutting his family one by
one until he did. You want to know how I know that delightful piece of Earth
history trivia?'
Ortega said nothing, but her mouth was tight with disgust.
'I know because Kawahara told me. That's what she used to do when she was a
kid. She was a water carrier. And she's proud of it.'
The phone chimed.
I waved back Ortega out of range and went to answer it.
'Kovacs?' It was Rodrigo Bautista. 'Is Ortega with you?'
'No.' I lied automatically. 'Haven't seen her for a couple of days. Is there a
problem?'
'Ah, probably not. She's vanished off the face of the planet again. Well, if you do
see her, tell her she missed a squad assembly this afternoon and Captain Murawa
wasn't impressed.'

'Should I expect to see her?'
'With Ortega, who fucking knows?' Bautista spread his hands. 'Look, I've got to
go. See you around.'
'See you.' I watched as the screen blanked, and Ortega came back from her place
by the wall. 'Did you get that?'
'Yeah. I was supposed to turn the Hendrix memory discs over this morning.
Murawa will probably want to know why I took them out of Fell Street in the
first place.'
'It's your case, isn't it?'
'Yeah, but there are norms.' Ortega looked suddenly tired. 'I can't stall them for
long, Kovacs. I'm already getting a lot of funny looks for working with you.
Pretty soon someone's going to get seriously suspicions. You've got a few days
to run this scam on Bancroft, but after that . . . '
She raised her hands eloquently.
'Can't you say you were held up? That Kadmin took the discs off you?'
'They'll polygraph me — '
'Not immediately.'
'Kovacs, this is my career we're flushing clown the toilet here, not yours. I don't
do this job for fun, it's taken me — '
'Kristin, listen to me.' I went to her and took her hands in mine. 'Do you want
Ryker back, or not?'
She tried to turn away from me, but I held on.
'Kristin. Do you believe he was set up?'
She swallowed. 'Yes.'
'Then why not believe it was Kawahara? The cruiser he tried to shoot down in
Seattle was heading out over the ocean when it crashed. You extrapolate that

heading and see where it takes you. You plot the point that the Coastals fished
Mary Lou Hinchley out of the sea. Then put Head in the Clouds on the map and
see if it all adds up to anything.'
Ortega pulled away from me with a strange look in her eyes.
'You want this to be true, don't you? You want the excuse to go after Kawahara,
no matter what. It's just hate with you, isn't it? Another score to settle. You don't
care about Ryker. You don't even care about your friend, Sarah any — '
'Say that again,' I told her coldly, 'and I'll deck you. For your information,
nothing that we've just discussed matters more to me than Sarah's life. And
nothing I've said means I have any option other than to do exactly what
Kawahara wants.'
'Then what's the fucking point?'
I wanted to reach out for her. Instead, I turned the yearning into a displacement
gesture with both hands chopping gently at the air.
'I don't know. Not yet. But if I can get Sarah clear, there might be a way to bring
Kawahara down afterwards. And there might be a way to clear Ryker too. That's
all I'm saying.'
She stayed looking at me for a moment, then turned and swept up her jacket
from the arm of the chair where she had draped it when we arrived.
'I'm going out for a while,' she said quietly.
'Fine.' I stayed equally quiet. This was not a moment for pressure. 'I'll be here, or
I'll leave a message for you if I have to go out.'
'Yes, do that.'
There was nothing in her voice to indicate whether she was really coming back
or not.
After she had gone, I sat thinking for a while longer, trying to flesh out the
glimpse of structure that the Envoy intuition had given me. When the phone
chimed again, I had evidently given up, because the chime caught me staring out

of the window, wondering where in Bay City Ortega had gone.
This time, it was Kawahara.
'I have what you want,' she said offhandedly. 'A dormant version of the Rawling
virus will be delivered to SilSet Holdings tomorrow morning after eight o'clock.
Address 1187 Sacramento. They'll know you're coming.'
'And the activator codes?'
'Delivery under separate cover. Trepp will contact you.'
I nodded. UN law governing transfer and ownership of war viruses was clear to
the point of bluntness. Inert viral forms could be owned as subjects for study, or
even, as one bizarre test case had proved, private trophies. Ownership or sale of
an active military virus, or the codes whereby a dormant virus could be
activated, was a UN indictable offence, punishable with anything between a
hundred and two hundred years' storage. In the event of the virus actually being
deployed, the sentence could be upped to erasure. Naturally these penalties were
only applicable to private citizens, not military commanders or government
executives. The powerful are jealous of their toys.
'Just make sure she contacts me soon,' I said briefly. 'I don't want to use up any
more of my ten days than I have to.'
'I understand.' Kawahara made a sympathetic face, for all the world as if the
threats against Sarah were being made by some malignant force of nature over
which neither of us had control. 'I will have Irene Elliott re-sleeved by tomorrow
evening. Nominally, she is being bought out of storage by JacSol SA, one of my
communications interface companies. You'll be able to collect her from Bay City
Central around ten o'clock. I have you temporarily accredited as a security
consultant for JacSol Division West. Name, Martin Anderson.'
'Got it.' This was Kawahara's way of telling me that if anything went wrong, I
was tied to her and would go down first. 'That's going to clash with Ryker's gene
signature. He'll be a live file at Bay City Central as long as the body's decanted.'
Kawahara nodded. 'Dealt with. Your accreditation will be routed through JacSol
corporate channels before any individual genetic search. A punch-in code.
Within JacSol, your gene print will be recorded as Anderson's. Any other

problems?'
'What if I bump into Sullivan?'
'Warden Sullivan has gone on extended leave. Some kind of psychological
problem. He is spending some time in virtual. You will not be seeing him again.'
Despite myself, I felt a cold shiver as I looked at Kawahara's composed features.
I cleared my throat.
'And the sleeve repurchase?'
'No.' Kawahara smiled faintly. 'I checked the specs. Irene Elliott's sleeve has no
biotech augmentation to justify the cost of retrieving it.'
'I didn't say it had. This isn't about technical capacity, it's about motivation. She'll
be more loyal if — '
Kawahara leant forward in the screen. 'I can be pushed so far, Kovacs. And then
it stops. Elliott's getting a compatible sleeve, she should be thankful for that. You
wanted her, any loyalty problems you have with her are going to be your
problems exclusively. I don't want to hear about it.'
'She'll take longer to adjust,' I said doggedly. 'In a new sleeve, she'll be slower,
less resp — '
'Also your problem. I offered you the best intrusion experts money can buy, and
you turned them down. You've got to learn to live with the consequences of your
actions, Kovacs.' She paused and sat back with another faint smile. 'I had a check
run on Elliott. Who she is, who her family are, what the connection is. Why you
wanted her off stack. It's a nice thought, Kovacs, but I'm afraid you're going to
have to support your own Good Samaritan gestures without my help. I'm not
running a charity here.'
'No.' I said flatly. 'I suppose not.'
'No. And I think we can also suppose that this will be the last direct contact
between us until this matter is resolved.'
'Yes.'

'Well, inappropriate though it may seem, good luck, Kovacs.'
The screen blanked, leaving the words hanging in the air. I sat for what seemed
like a long time, hearing them, staring at an imagined afterimage on screen that
my hate made almost real. When I spoke, Ryker's voice sounded alien in my
ears, as if someone or something else was speaking through me.
'Inappropriate is right,' it said into the quiet room. 'Motherfucker.'
Ortega did not come back, but the aroma of what she had cooked curled through
the apartment and my stomach flexed in sympathy. I waited some more, still
trying to assemble all the jagged edges of the puzzle in my mind, but either my
heart was not in it or there was still something major missing. Finally, I forced
down the coppery taste of the hate and frustration, and went to eat.

CHAPTER THIRTY

Kawahara's groundwork was flawless.
An automated limo with JacSol insignia lightning-flashed onto its flanks turned
up outside the Hendrix at eight the next morning. I went down to meet it and
found the rear cabin stacked with Chinese designer-label boxes.
Opened back in my room, the boxes yielded a line of high quality corporate
props that Serenity Carlyle would have gone wild for: two blocky, sand-coloured
suits, cut to Ryker's size, a half dozen handmade shirts with the JacSol logo
embroidered on each wing collar, formal shoes in real leather, a midnight blue
raincoat, a JacSol dedicated mobile phone and a small black disc with a
thumbprint DNA encoding pad.
I showered and shaved, dressed and ran the disc. Kawahara blinked up on the
screen, construct-perfect.
'Good morning, Takeshi-san, and welcome to JacSol Communications. The DNA
coding on this disc is now webbed into a line of credit in the name Martin James
Anderson. As I mentioned earlier, the punch-in corporate prefix for JacSol will
negate any clash with Ryker's genetic records or the account set up for you by
Bancroft. Please note the coding below.'
I read off the string of digits in a single sweep, and went back to watching
Kawahara's face.

'The JacSol account will bear all reasonable expenses and is programmed to
expire at the end of our ten-day agreement. Should you wish to dissolve the
account earlier than this, double punch the code, apply the gene trace and double
punch again.
'Trepp will contact you via the corporate mobile some time today, so keep the
unit with you at all times. Irene Elliott will be downloaded at 21.45 West Coast
time. Processing should take about forty-five minutes. And by the time you
receive this message, SilSet Holdings will have your package. After consultation
with my own experts, I have appended a list of the likely hardware Elliott will
need, and a number of suppliers who can be trusted to acquire it discreetly.
Charge everything through the JacSol account. The list will print out in hardcopy
momentarily.
'Should you need any repetition of these details, the disc will remain playable for
the next eighteen minutes, at which point it will self wipe. You are now on your
own.'
Kawahara's features arranged themselves in a PR smile and the image faded as
the printer chittered out the hardware list. I scanned it briefly on my way down
to the limo.
Ortega had not come back.
At SilSet Holdings I was treated like a Harlan Family heir. Polished human
receptionists busied themselves with my comfort while a technician brought out
a metal cylinder roughly the dimensions of a hallucinogen grenade.
Trepp was less impressed. I met her early that: evening, as per her phoned
instructions, in a bar in Oakland, and when she saw the JacSol image she
laughed sourly.
'You look like a fucking programmer, Kovacs. Where'd you get that suit?'
'My name's Anderson,' I reminded her. 'And the suit goes with the name.'
She pulled a face.
'Well next time you go shopping, Anderson, take me with you. I'll save you a lot
of money, and you won't come out looking like a guy takes the kids to Honolulu

at weekends.'
I leaned across the tiny table. 'You know Trepp, last time you gave me a hard
time about my dress sense, I killed you.'
She shrugged. 'Goes to show. Some people just can't take the truth.'
'Did you bring the stuff?'
Trepp put her hand flat on the table, and when she removed it there was a
nondescript grey disc sealed in impact plastic between us.
'There you go. As requested. Now I know you're crazy.' There might have been
something like admiration in her voice. 'You know what they do to you on Earth
for playing with this stuff?'
I covered the disc with my own hand and pocketed it. 'Same as anywhere else, I
guess. Federal offence, down the double barrel. You forget, I don't have any
choice.'
Trepp scratched an ear. 'Double barrel, or the Big Wipe. I haven't enjoyed
carrying this around all day. You got the rest of it there?'
'Why? Worried about being seen in public with me?'
She smiled. 'A bit. I hope you know what you're doing.'
I hoped so too. The bulky, grenade-sized package I'd collected from SilSet had
been burning a hole in my expensive coat pocket all day.
I went back to the Hendrix and checked for messages. Ortega had not called. I
killed time in the hotel room, thinking through the line I was going to feed
Elliott. At nine I got back in the limo and took it down to Bay City Central.
I sat in a reception room while a young doctor completed the necessary
paperwork and I initialled the forms where he indicated. There was an eerie
familiarity to the process. Most of the clauses in the parole were on behalf of
stipulations, which effectively made me responsible for Irene Elliott's conduct
during the release period. She had even less say in the matter than I'd had when I
arrived the week before.

When Elliott finally emerged from the RESTRICTED ZONE doors beyond the
reception rooms, it was with the halting step of someone recovering from a
debilitating illness. The shock of the mirror was written into her new face. When
you don't do it for a living, it's no easy thing to face the stranger for the first time
and the face that Elliott now wore was almost as far from the big-boned blonde I
remembered from her husband's photocube as Ryker was from my own previous
sleeve. Kawahara had described the new sleeve as compatible, and it fitted that
bleak description perfectly. It was a female body, about the same age as Elliott's
original body had been, but there the resemblance ended. Where Irene Elliott had
been big and fair-skirmed, this sleeve had the sheen of a narrow vein of copper
seen through falling water. Thick black hair framed a face with eyes like hot
coals and lips the colour of plums, and the body was slim and delicate.
'Irene Elliott?'
She leaned unsteadily on the reception counter as she turned to look at me. 'Yes.
Who are you?'
'My name is Martin Anderson. I represent JacSol Division West. We arranged
for your parole.'
Her eyes narrowed a little, scanning me from head to foot and back again. 'You
don't look like a programmer. Apart from the suit, I mean.'
'I'm a security consultant, attached to JacSol for certain projects. There is some
work we would like you to do for us.'
'Yeah? Couldn't get anyone else to do it cheaper than this?' She gestured around
her. 'What happened, did I get famous while I was in the store?'
'In a sense,' I said carefully. 'Perhaps it would be better if we dealt with the
formalities here and moved on. There is a limousine waiting.'
'A limo?' The incredulity in her voice put a genuine smile on my face for the first
time that day. She signed the final release as if in a dream.

'Who are you really?' she asked when the limousine was in the air. It felt like a
lot of people had been asking me that over the past few days. I was almost

beginning to wonder myself.
I stared ahead over the navigation block of the limo. 'A friend,' I said quietly.
'That's all you need to know for now.'
'Before we start anything, I want — '
'I know.' The limousine was banking in the sky as I said it. 'We'll be in Ember in
about half an hour.'
I hadn't turned but I could feel the heat of her stare on the side of my face.
'You're not corporate,' she said definitely. 'Corporates don't do this stuff. Not like
this.'
'The corporates do whatever turns a profit. Don't let your prejudices blind you.
Sure, they'll burn down entire villages if it pays. But if having a human face is
what cuts it, they'll whip out a human face and put it on.'
'And you're the human face?'
'Not exactly.'
'What's the work you want me to do? Something illegal?'
I pulled the cylindrical virus loader out of my pocket and passed it across to her.
She took it in both hands and examined the decals with professional interest. As
far as I was concerned, this was the first test. I'd pulled Elliott out of the store
because that way she would be mine in a way no one supplied by Kawahara or
skimmed off the street would ever be. But beyond that I had nothing to go on but
instinct and Victor Elliott's word that his wife was good, and I was feeling
slightly queasy about the direction I'd let things go. Kawahara was right. Good
Samaritan gestures can be expensive.
'So let's see. You've got a first-generation Simultec virus here.' Scorn made her
enunciate each syllable slowly. 'Collector's item, practically a relic. And you've
got it in a state-of-the-art rapid deployment jacket with anti-locational casing.
Why don't you just cut the crap and tell me what's really in here? You're
planning a run, aren't you?'

I nodded.
'What's the target?'
'Virtual whorehouse. AI-managed.'
Elliott's new lips parted in a soundless whistle. 'Liberation run?'
'No. We're installing.'
'Installing this?' She hefted the cylinder. 'So what is it?'
'Rawling 4851.'
Elliott stopped hefting abruptly. 'That's not funny.'
'Wasn't intended to be. That's a dormant Rawling variant. Set for rapid
deployment, as you so rightly observed. The activation codes are in my pocket.
We are going to plant Rawling inside an AI whorehouse database, inject the
codes and then weld the lid shut: on it. There's some peripheral stuff with
monitoring systems, and some tidying up, but basically that's the run.'
She gave me a curious look. 'Are you some kind of religious nut?'
'No.' I smiled faintly. 'It's nothing like that. Can you do it?'
'Depends on the AI. Do you have the specs?'
'Not here.'
Elliott handed me back the deployment jacket. 'I can't tell you, then, can I?'
'That was what I was hoping you'd say.' I stowed the cylinder, satisfied. 'How's
the new sleeve?'
'It's OK. Any reason why I couldn't have my own body back? I'll be a lot faster
in my own — '
'I know. Unfortunately it's out of my hands. Did they tell you how long you've
been in the store?'

'Four years, someone said.'
'Four and a half,' I said, glancing at the release forms I'd signed. Tin afraid, in the
meantime, someone took a shine to your sleeve and bought it.'
'Oh.' She was silent then. The shock of waking up inside someone else's body for
the first time is nothing compared to the sense of rage and betrayal you feel
knowing that someone, somewhere, is walking around inside you. It's like the
discovery of infidelity, but at the intimacy range of rape. And like both those
violations, there's nothing you can do about it. You just get used to it.
When the silence stretched, I looked across at her still profile and cleared my
throat.
'You sure you want to do this right now? Go home, I mean.'
She barely bothered to look at me. 'Yes, I'm sure. I have a daughter and a
husband that haven't seen me in nearly five years. You think this — ' she
gestured down at herself ' — is going to stop me?'
'Fair enough.'
The lights of Ember appeared on the darkened mass of the coastline up ahead,
and the limousine began its descent. I watched Elliott out of the corner of my eye
and saw the nervousness setting in. Palms rubbing together in her lap, lower lip
caught in her teeth at one corner of her new mouth. She released her breath with
a small but perfectly audible noise.
'They don't know I'm coming?' she asked.
'No.' I said shortly. I didn't want to follow this line of conversation. 'The contract
is between you and JacSol West. It doesn't concern your family.'
'But you arranged for me to see them. Why?'
'I'm a sucker for family reunions.' I fixed my gaze on the darkened bulk of the
wrecked aircraft carrier below, and we landed in silence. The autolimo banked
round to align itself with the local traffic systems and touched down a couple of
hundred metres north of Elliott's Data Linkage. We powered smoothly along the
shore road under the successive holos of Anchana Salomao and parked immacu-

lately opposite the narrow frontage. The dead monitor doorstop had been
removed and the door was closed but there were lights burning in the glasswalled office at the back.
We climbed out and crossed the street. The closed door proved to be locked as
well. Irene Elliott: banged impatiently at it with the flat of one copper-skinned
hand and someone sat up sluggishly in the back office. After a moment, a figure
identifiable as Victor Elliott came down to the transmission floor, past the
reception counter and towards us. His grey hair was untidy and his face swollen
with sleep. He peered out at us with a lack of focus I'd seen before on datarats
when they'd been cruising the stacks for too long. Jack-happy.
'Who the hell — ' He stopped as he recognised me. 'What the fuck do you want,
grasshopper? And who's this?'
'Vic?' Irene Elliott's new throat sounded nine tenths closed. 'Vic, it's me.'
For a moment, Elliott's eyes ran a volley between my face and the delicate Asian
woman beside me, then what she had said smacked into him like a truck. He
flinched visibly with the impact.
'Irene?' he whispered.
'Yes, it's me,' she husked back. There were tears leaking down her cheeks. For
moments they stared at each other through the glass, then Victor Elliott was
fumbling with the locking mechanism of the door, shoving at the frame to get it
out of the way, and the copper-skinned woman sagged across the threshold into
his arms. They locked together in an embrace that looked set to break the new
sleeve's delicate bones. I took a mild interest in street: lamps up and down the
promenade.
Finally, Irene Elliott remembered me. She disengaged from her husband and
twisted round, smearing the tears off her face with the heel of one hand and
blinking bright-eyed at me.
'Can you — '
'Sure.' I said neutrally. 'I'll wait in the limo. See you in the morning.'
I caught one confused look from Victor Elliott as his wife bustled him inside,

nodded good-naturedly at him and turned away to the parked limo and the beach.
The door banged shut behind me. I felt in my pockets and came up with Ortega's
crumpled packet of cigarettes. Wandering past the limo to the iron railing, I
kindled one of the bent and flattened cylinders and for once felt no sense that I
was betraying something as the smoke curled into my lungs. Down on the beach,
the surf was up, a chorus line of ghosts along the sand. I leaned on the railing
and listened to the white noise of the waves as they broke, wondering why I
could feel this much at peace with so much still unresolved. Ortega had not
come back. Kadmin was still out there. Sarah was still under ransom, Kawahara
still had me by the balls, and I still didn't know why Bancroft had been killed.
And despite it all, there was space for this measure of quiet.
Take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
My gaze slipped out past the breakers. The ocean beyond was black and secret,
merging seamlessly with the night a scant distance out from the shore. Even the
massive bulk of the keeled-over Free Trade Enforcer was hard to make out. I
imagined Mary Lou Hinchley hurtling down to her shattering impact with the
unyielding water, then slipping broken beneath the swells to be cradled in wait
for the sea's predators. How long had she been out there before the currents
contrived to carry what was left of her back to her own kind? How long had the
darkness held her?
My thoughts skipped aimlessly, cushioned on the vague sense of acceptance and
well-being. I saw Bancroft's antique telescope, trained on the heavens and the
tiny motes of light that were Earth's first hesitant steps beyond the limits of the
solar system. Fragile arks carrying the recorded selves of a million pioneers and
the deep-frozen embryo banks that might someday re-sleeve them on distant
worlds, if the promise of the vaguely understood Martian astrogation charts bore
fruit. If not they would drift forever, because the universe is mostly night and
darkened ocean.
Raising an eyebrow at my own introspection, I heaved myself off the rail and
glanced up at the holographic face above my head. Anchana Salomao had the
night to herself. Her ghostly countenance gazed down at repeated intervals along
the promenade, compassionate but uninvolved. Looking at the composed
features, it was easy to see why Elizabeth Elliott had wanted so badly to attain
those heights. I would have given a lot for that same detached composure. I

shifted my attention to the windows above Elliott's. The lights were on there, and
as I watched a female form moved across one of them in naked silhouette. I
sighed, spun the stub of my cigarette into the gutter and took refuge in the limo.
Let Anchana keep the vigil. I called up channels at random on the entertainment
deck and let the mindless barrage of images and sounds numb me into a kind of
half-sleep. The night passed around the vehicle like cold mist and I suffered the
vague sensation that I was drifting away from the lights of the Elliotts' home, out
to sea on snapped moorings with nothing between me and the horizon where
there was a storm building . . .
A sharp rapping on the window beside my head shook me awake. I jerked round
from the position I'd slumped into and saw Trepp standing patiently outside. She
gestured at me to wind down the window, then leaned in with a grin.
'Kawahara was right about you. Sleeping in the car so this Dipper can get laid.
You've got delusions of priesthood, Kovacs.'
'Shut up, Trepp,' I said irritably. 'What time is it?'
'About five.' Her eyes swivelled up and left to consult the chip. 'Five-sixteen. Be
getting light soon.'
I struggled into a more upright position, tasting the residue of the single cigarette
on my tongue. 'What are you doing here?'
'Watching your back. We don't want Kadmin taking you out before you can sell
the goods to Bancroft, do we? Hey, is that the Wreckers?'
I followed her gaze forward to the entertainment deck, which was still screening
some kind of sports coverage. Minuscule figures rushed backwards and forwards
on a cross-hatched field, accompanied by a barely audible commentary. A brief
collision between two players occasioned an insectile roar of cheering. I must
have lowered the volume before I fell asleep. Switching the deck off, I saw in the
ensuing dimness that Trepp had been right. The night had washed out to a soft
blue gloom that was creeping over the buildings beside us like a bleach stain on
the darkness.
'Not a fan, then?' Trepp nodded at the screen. 'I didn't use to be, but you live in
New York long enough, you get the habit.'

'Trepp, how the fuck are you supposed to watch my back if your head is jammed
in here watching screen?'
Trepp gave me a hurt look and withdrew her head. I climbed out of the limo and
stretched in the chilly air. Overhead, Anchana Salomao was still resplendent, but
the lights above Elliott's were out.
'They stayed up until a couple of hours ago,' said Trepp helpfully. 'I thought they
might be running out on you, so I checked the back.'
I gazed up at the darkened windows. 'Why are they going to run out on me? She
hasn't even heard what the terms of the deal are.'
'Well, involvement in an erasure offence tends to make most people nervous.'
'Not this woman,' I said, and wondered how much I believed myself.
Trepp shrugged. 'Suit yourself. I still think you're crazy, though. Kawahara's got
Dippers could do this stuff standing on their heads.'
Since my own reasons for not accepting Kawahara's offer of technical support
were almost entirely instinctive, I said nothing. The icy certainty of my
revelations about Bancroft, Kawahara and Resolution 653 had faded with the
previous day's rush of set-up details for the run, and any sense of interlocking
well-being had gone when Ortega left. All I had now was the gravity pull of
mission time, the cold dawn and the sound of the waves on the shore. The taste
of Ortega in my mouth and the warmth of her long-limbed body curled into mine
was a tropical island in the chill, receding in my wake.
'You reckon there's somewhere open this early that serves coffee,' I asked.
'Town this size?' Trepp drew breath in through her teeth. 'Doubt it. But I saw a
bank of dispensers on the way in. Got to be one that does coffee.'
'Machine coffee?' I curled my lip.
'Hey, what are you, a fucking connoisseur? You're living in a hotel that's just one
big goddamned dispenser. Christ, Kovacs, this is the Machine Age. Didn't
anybody tell you that?'

'You got a point. How far is it?'
'Couple of klicks. We'll take my car, that way if Little Miss Homecoming wakes
up, she won't look out the window and panic.'
'Sold.'
I followed Trepp across the street to a low-slung black vehicle that looked as if it
might be radar invisible, and climbed into a snug interior that smelled faintly of
incense.
'This yours?'
'No, rented. Picked it up when we flew back in from Europe? Why?'
I shook my head. 'Doesn't matter.'
Trepp started up and we ghosted silently along the promenade. I looked out of
the seaward window and wrestled with an insubstantial sense of frustration. The
scant hours of sleep in the limo had left me itchy. Everything about the situation
was suddenly chafing at me again, from the lack of solution to Bancroft's death
to my relapse into smoking. I had a feeling that it was going to be a bad day, and
the sun wasn't even up yet.
'You thought about what you're going to do when this is over?'
'No,' I said morosely.
We found the dispensers on a frontage that sloped down to the shore at one end
of the town. Clearly they had been installed with beach clientele in mind, but the
dilapidated state of the shelters that housed them suggested that trade was no
better here than for Elliott's Data Linkage. Trepp parked the car pointing at the
sea and went to get the coffees. Through the window I watched her kick and
slam the machine until it finally relinquished two plastic cups. She carried them
back to the car and handed me mine.
'Want to drink it here?'
'Yeah, why not?'

We pulled the tabs on the cups and listened to them sizzle. The mechanism didn't
heat especially well, but the coffee tasted reasonable and it had a definite
chemical effect. I could feel my weariness sliding away. We drank slowly and
watched the sea through the windscreen, immersed in a silence that was almost
companionable.
'I tried for the Envoys once,' said Trepp suddenly.
I glanced sideways at her, curious. 'Yeah?'
'Yeah, long time ago. They rejected me on profile. No capacity for allegiance,
they said.'
I grunted. 'Figures. You were never in the military, were you?'
'What do you think?' She was looking at me as if I'd just suggested she might
have a history of child-molesting. I chuckled tiredly.
'Thought not. See, the thing is, they're looking for borderline psychopathic
tendencies. That's why they do most of their recruiting from the military in the
first place.'
Trepp looked put out. 'I've got borderline psychopathic tendencies.'
'Yeah, I don't doubt it, but the point is, the number of civilians with those
tendencies and a sense of team spirit is pretty limited. They're opposing values.
The chances of them both arising naturally in the same person are almost nil.
Military training takes the natural order and fucks with it. It breaks down any
resistance to psychopathic behaviour at the same time as it builds fanatical
loyalties to the group. Package deal. Soldiers are perfect Envoy material.'
'You make it sound like I had a lucky escape.'
For a few seconds I stared out to the horizon, remembering.
'Yeah.' I drained the rest of my coffee. 'Come on, let's get back.'
As we drove back along the promenade, something had changed in the quiet
between us. Something that, like the gradually waxing light of dawn around the
car, was at once intangible and impossible to ignore.

When we pulled up outside the data broker's frontage, Irene Elliott was waiting,
leaned against the side of the limo arid watching the sea. There was no sign of
her husband.
'Better stay here,' I told Trepp as I climbed out. 'Thanks for the coffee.'
'Sure.'
'I guess I'll be seeing you in my rear-view screen for a while, then.'
'I doubt you'll see me at all, Kovacs,' said Trepp cheerfully. 'I'm better at this than
you are.'
'Remains to be seen.'
'Yeah, yeah. Be seeing you.' She raised her voice as I started to walk away. 'And
don't fuck up that run. We'd all hate to see that happen.'
She backed up the car a dozen metres and kicked it into the air in a showy,
dropped-nose bunt that shattered the quiet with a shriek of turbines and barely
cleared our heads before flipping up and out over the ocean.
'Who was that?' There was a huskiness to Irene Elliott's voice that sounded like
the residue of too much crying.
'Back-up,' I said absently, watching the car trail out over the wrecked aircraft
carrier. 'Works for the same people. Don't worry, she's a friend.'
'She may be your friend,' said Elliott bitterly. 'She isn't mine. None of you people
are.'
I looked at her, then back out to sea. 'Fair enough.'
Silence, apart from the waves. Elliott shifted against the polished coachwork of
the limo.
'You know what's happened to my daughter,' she said in a dead voice. 'You knew
all the time.'
I nodded.

'And you don't give a flying fuck, do you? You're working for the man that used
her like a piece of toilet tissue.'
'Lots of men used her,' I said brutally. 'She let herself be used. And I'm sure your
husband's told you why she did that as well.'
I heard Irene Elliott's breath catch in her throat and concentrated on the horizon,
where Trepp's cruiser was fading into the predawn gloom. 'She did it for the
same reason she tried to blackmail the man I was working for, the same reason
she tried to put drivers on a particularly unpleasant man called Jerry Sedaka who
subsequently had her killed. She did it for you, Irene.'
'You fuck.' She started to cry, a small hopeless sound in the stillness.
I kept my eyes fixed on the ocean. 'I don't work for Bancroft any more,' I said
carefully. 'I've swapped sides on that piece of shit. I'm giving you the chance to
hit Bancroft where it hurts, to hit him with the guilt that fucking your daughter
never gave him. Plus, now you're out of the store maybe you'll be able to get the
money together and re-sleeve Elizabeth. Or at least get her off stack, rent her
some space in a virtual condo or something. The point is, you're off the ice, you
can do something. You've got options. That's what I'm offering you. I'm dealing
you back into the game. Don't throw that away.'
Beside me, I heard her struggling to force down the tears. I waited.
'You're pretty impressed with yourself, aren't you?' she said finally. 'You think
you're doing me this big favour, but you're no fucking Good Samaritan. I mean,
you got me out of the store, but it all comes at a price, right?'
'Of course it does,' I said quietly.
'I do what you want, this virus run. I break the law for you, or I go back on stack.
And if I squeal, or screw up, I've got more to lose than you. That's the deal, isn't
it? Nothing for free.'
I watched the waves. 'That's the deal,' I agreed.
More silence. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her look down at the body she
was wearing, as if she'd spilled something down herself. 'Do you know how I
feel?' she asked.

'No.'
'I slept with my husband, and I feel like he's been unfaithful to me.' A choked
laugh. She smeared angrily at her eyes. 'I feel like I've been unfaithful. To
something. You know, when they put me away I left a body and a family behind.
Now I don't have either.'
She looked down at herself again. She lifted her hands and turned them, fingers
spread.
'I don't know what I feel,' she said. 'I don't know what to feel.'
There was a lot I could have said. A lot that has been said, written, researched
and disputed on the subject. Trite little magazine-length summings-up of the
problems inherent in re-sleeving — How to make your partner love you again, in
any body — trite, interminable psychological tracts — Some observations of
secondary trauma in civil re-sleeving — even the sanctified manuals of the
fucking Envoy Corps itself had something trite to say on the matter. Quotes,
informed opinion, the ravings of the religious and the lunatic fringe. I could have
thrown it all at her. I could have told her that what she was going through was
quite normal for an unconditioned human. I could have told her that it would
pass with time. That there were psychodynamic disciplines for dealing with it.
That millions of other people survived it. I could even have told her that whichever God she owed nominal allegiance to was watching over her. I could have
lied, I could have reasoned. It all would have meant about the same, because the
reality was pain, and right now there was nothing anyone could do to take it
away.
I said nothing.
The dawn gained on us, light strengthening on the closed-up frontages behind us.
I glanced at the windows of Elliott's Data Linkage.
'Victor?' I asked.
'Sleeping.' She wiped an arm across her face and snorted her tears back under
control like badly cut amphetamine. 'You say this is going to hurt Bancroft?'
'Yeah. In a subtle way, but yeah, it'll hurt.'

'Installation run on an AI,' said Irene Elliott to me. 'Installing an erasure penalty
virus. Fucking over a known Meth. You know what the risks are? You know
what you're asking me to do?'
I turned to look her in the eye.
'Yes. I know.'
Her mouth clamped down on a tremor.
'Good. Then let's do it.'

CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

The run took less than three days to set up. Irene Elliott turned stone-cold pro
and made it happen that way.
In the limo back to Bay City, I laid it out for her. At first she was still crying
inside, but as the detail mounted she clicked in, nodding, grunting, stopping me
and backing me up on minor points I hadn't made clear enough. I showed her
Reileen Kawahara's suggested hardware list and she OK'd about two thirds of it.
The rest was just corporate padding and Kawahara's advisors, in her opinion,
didn't know shit.
By the end of the journey she had it down. I could see the run already unfolding
behind her eyes. The tears had dried on her face, forgotten, and her expression
was clean purpose, locked-down hate for the man who had used her daughter,
and an embodied will to revenge.
Irene Elliott was sold.

I rented an apartment in Oakland on the JacSol account. Elliott moved in and I
left her there to catch up on some sleep. I stayed at the Hendrix, tried to do some
sleeping of my own without much success and went back six hours later to find
Elliott already prowling about the apartment.

I called the names and numbers Kawahara had given me and ordered the staff
Elliott had ticked. The crates arrived in hours. Elliott cracked them open and laid
out the hardware across the floor of the apartment.
Together we went through Ortega's list of virtual forums and worked it down to a
shortlist of seven.
(Ortega had not turned up, or called me at the Hendrix.)
Mid afternoon on the second day, Elliott kicked on the primary modules and
cruised each of the shortlist options. The list fell to three, and Elliott gave me a
couple more items to go shopping for. Refinement software for the big kill.
By early evening the list was down to two, with Elliott writing up preliminary
intrusion procedures for both. Whenever she hit a glitch, we backed up and
compared relative merits.
By midnight we had our target. Elliott went to bed and slept eight solid hours. I
went back to the Hendrix and brooded.
(Nothing from Ortega.)
I bought breakfast in the street and took it back to the apartment. Neither of us
felt much like eating.
10.15 local time. Irene Elliott calibrated her equipment for the last time.

We did it.
Twenty-seven-and-a-half minutes.
A piece of piss, said Elliott.
I left her dismantling equipment and flew out to see Bancroft that afternoon.

CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

'I find this exceptionally difficult to believe,' said Bancroft sharply. 'Are you
quite sure I went to this establishment?'
Below the balcony on the lawns of Suntouch House, Miriam Bancroft appeared
to be constructing an enormous paper glider from instructions in a moving
holoprojection. The white of the wings was so bright it hurt to look directly at
them. As I leaned on the balcony rail, she shaded her eyes from the sun and
looked up at me.
'The mall has security monitors.' I said, affecting disinterest. 'Automated system,
still operational after all these years. They've got footage of you walking right up
to the door. You do know the name, don't you?'
'Jack It Up? Of course, I've heard of it, but I've never actually used the place.'
I looked round without leaving the rail. 'Really. You have something against
virtual sex, then? You're a reality purist?'
'No.' I could hear the smile in his voice. 'I have no problem with virtual formats,
and as I believe I've told you already, I have used them on occasion. But this
place Jack It Up is, how can I put it, hardly the elegant end of the market.'
'No,' I agreed. 'And how would you classify Jerry's Closed Quarters? An elegant
whorehouse?'

'Hardly.'
'But that didn't stop you going there to play cabin games with Elizabeth Elliott,
did it? Or has it gone downhill recently, because — '
'All right.' The smile in the voice had turned to a grimace. 'You've made your
point. Don't: labour it.'
I stopped watching Miriam Bancroft and came back to my seat. My iced cocktail
was still standing on the little table between us. I picked it up.
'I'm glad you take the point,' I said, stirring the drink. 'Because it's taken a lot of
pain to sort through this mess. I've been abducted, tortured and nearly killed in
the process. A woman called Louise, not much older than your precious daughter
Naomi, was killed because she got in the way. So if you don't like my
conclusions, you can go fuck yourself.'
I raised my glass to him across the table.
'Spare me the melodrama, Kovacs, and sit down for God's sake. I'm not rejecting
what you say, I'm just questioning it.'
I sat and levelled a finger at him. 'No. You're squirming. This thing's pointing up
a part of your character you despise for its appetites. You'd rather not know what
kind of software you were accessing that night over at Jack It Up, in case it's
even more grubby than you already imagine. You're being forced to confront the
part of yourself that wants to come in your wife's face, and you don't like it.'
'There will be no need to revisit that particular conversation,' said Bancroft
stiffly. He steepled his fingers. 'You are aware, I suppose, that the security
camera footage you base your assumptions on could be faked very easily by
anyone with access to newstape images of me.'
'Yes, I am.' I'd watched Irene Elliott do exactly that only forty-eight hours
previously. Easy wasn't the word. After the virus run, it had been like asking a
concert total body dancer to encore with stretching exercises. I'd barely had time
to smoke a cigarette while she did it. 'But why would anyone bother? A
distractor, to tinsel me off course, assuming of course that some wrong turn
would have me sniffing around the ruins of a derelict Richmond mall in the first
place. Come on, Bancroft, get real. The fact I was out there in the first place

proves the validity of that footage. And in any case, those images aren't the basis
for anything. They just confirm what I'd already worked out, which is that you
killed yourself to avoid viral contamination of your remote stack.'
'That is a quite remarkable leap of intuition to make after only a six-day
investigation.'
'Blame Ortega,' I said lightly, though Bancroft's enduring suspicion in the face of
unpleasant facts was beginning to worry me. I hadn't realised he would take so
much wearing down. 'She's the one who put me onto the right track. She
wouldn't wear the murder theory from the start. She kept telling me you were too
tough and smart a Meth motherfucker to let anyone kill you. Quote, unquote.
And that brought me back to the conversation we had here a week ago. You told
me I am not the kind of man to take my own life, and even if I was, I would not
have bungled it in this fashion. If it had been my intention to die, you would not
be talking to me now. Envoys have total recall, those were your exact words.'
I paused and set down my glass, searching for the fine edge of deceit that always
lies right up against the truth.
'All this time, I've been working on the assumption you didn't pull the trigger
because you weren't the type to commit suicide. I ignored all the evidence to the
contrary because of that single assumption. The electron-tight security you've
got here, the lack of any traces of intrusion, the handprint lock on the safe.'
'And Kadmin. And Ortega.'
'Yeah, that didn't help. But we straightened out the Ortega angle, and Kadmin,
well, I'm coming to Kadmin in a moment. The point is, as long as I equated
pulling that trigger with suicide, I was jammed. But then, what if those two acts
were not synonymous. What if you'd torched your own stack, not because you
wanted to die but for some other reason. Once I let myself think that, the rest
was easy. What were the possible reasons that you'd do it? It's not an easy thing
to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. To do it when you
want to live must take the will of a demon. No matter how much you might
know intellectually that you'll be re-sleeved with the bulk of your mind intact,
the person you are at that moment is going to die. You had to have been
desperate to pull that trigger. It had to have been something,' I smiled faintly,
'life-threatening. Given that assumption, it didn't take long to come up with the

virus scenario. Then all I had to do was work out how and where you'd been
infected.'
Bancroft shifted uncomfortably at the word, and I felt a stab of elation run
through me. Virus! Even Meths were afraid of the invisible corroder, because
even they, with their remote storage and their clones on ice, were not immune.
Viral Strike! Stack down! Bancroft was off balance.
'Now, it's virtually impossible to snug something as complex as a virus into a
disconnected target, so you had to have been jacked in somewhere along the line.
I thought of the PsychaSec facility, but they're sewed up too tight. And it couldn't
have been before you went to Osaka for the same reasons; even dormant, the
virus would have tripped every alarm at PsychaSec when they set up the 'cast. It
had to have been some time in the last forty-eight hours, because your remote
stack was uncontaminated. I knew from talking to your wife that the likelihood
was you'd been out on the town when you got back from Osaka, and on your
own admission that could quite possibly include some kind of virtual
whorehouse. After that, it was just a matter of doing the rounds. I tried a half
dozen places before I hit Jack It Up, and when I punched up their inquiries the
viral contam siren nearly blew my phone out. That's the thing about AIs — they
write their own security and it's second to none. Jack It Up is sealed off so tight
it'll take the police months to tunnel in and see what's left of the core processors.'
I felt a vague pang of guilt as I thought of the AI thrashing like a man in an acid
vat as its systems dissolved around it, consciousness shrivelling down a tunnel of
closing perspectives into nothing. The feeling passed rapidly. We'd chosen Jack
It Up for a variety of reasons: it was in a roofed-over area that meant there would
be no satellite coverage to dispute the lies we'd planted in the mall surveillance
system, it operated in a criminal environment so that no one would have a
problem believing an illicit virus had somehow got loose inside it, but most of
all it ran a series of software options so distasteful that it was unlikely the police
would ever bother to investigate the wreckage of the murdered machine more
than cursorily. Under its heading on Ortega's list, there were at least a dozen
copycat sex crimes which the Organic Damage department had traced to
software packages available from Jack It Up. I could imagine the curl of Ortega's
lip as she read the software listings, the studied indifference with which she
would handle the case.
I missed Ortega.

'What about Kadmin?'
'It's hard to know, but I'm betting whoever infected Jack It Up in the first place
probably hired Kadmin to silence me and make sure the whole thing stayed
covered up. After all, without me stirring things up, how long would it have been
before anyone realised Jack had been iced? Can't see any of its potential clients
calling the police when they got refused entry, can you?'
Bancroft gave me a hard look, but I knew from his next words that the battle was
almost over. The balance of belief was tipping towards me. Bancroft was going
to buy the package. 'You're saying the virus was introduced deliberately. That
someone murdered this machine?'
I shrugged. 'It seems likely. Jack It Up operated on the margins of local law. A
lot of its software appears to have been impounded by the Felony Transmission
department at one time or another, which suggests that it had regular dealings
with the criminal world in one form or another. It is possible that it made some
enemies. On Harlan's World the yakuza have been known to perform viral
execution on machines judged to have betrayed them. I don't know if that
happens here, or who'd have the stack muscle to do it. But I do know that
whoever hired Kadmin used an AI to pull him out of police storage. You can
verify that with Fell Street, if you like.'
Bancroft was silent. I watched him for a moment, seeing the belief sink in.
Watching the process as he convinced himself. I could almost see what he was
seeing. Himself, hunched over in an autocab as the sordid guilt over what he had
been doing at Jack It Up merged sickeningly with the horror of the
contamination warnings sirening in his head. Infected! Himself, Laurens
Bancroft, stumbling through the dark towards the lights of Suntouch House and
the only surgery that could save him. Why had he left the cab so far from home?
Why had he not wakened anybody for help? These were questions I no longer
needed to answer for him. Bancroft believed. His guilt and self-disgust made him
believe, and he would find his own answers to reinforce the horrific images in
his head.
And by the time Transmission Felony cut a safe path through to Jack It Up's core
processors, Rawling 4851 would have eaten out every scrap of coherent intellect
the machine ever had. There would be nothing left to dispute the carefully
constructed lie I'd told for Kawahara.

I got up and went back to the balcony, wondering if I should allow myself a
cigarette. It had been tough to lock down the need the last couple of days.
Watching Irene Elliott at work had been nerve-racking. I forced my hand to
relinquish the packet in my breast pocket, and gazed down at Miriam Bancroft,
who by now was well on the way to completing her glider. When she looked up,
I glanced away along the balcony rail and saw Bancroft's telescope, still pointed
seaward at the same shallow angle. Idle curiosity made me lean across and look
at the figures for angle of elevation. The finger marks in the dust were still there.
Dust?
Bancroft's unconsciously arrogant words came back to me. It was an enthusiasm
I had. Back when the stars were still something to stare at. You wouldn't
remember how that felt. Last time I looked through that lens was nearly two
centuries ago.
I stared at the finger marks, mesmerised by my own thoughts. Someone had
been looking through this lens a lot more recently than two hundred years ago,
but they hadn't kept at it very long. From the minimal displacement of dust it
looked as if the programming keys had only been used once. On a sudden
impulse, I moved up to the telescope and followed the line of its barrel out over
the sea to where visibility blurred in the haze. That far out. the angle of elevation
would give you a view of empty air a couple of kilometres up. I bent to the eyepiece as if in a dream. A grey speck showed up in the centre of my field of
vision, blurring in and out of focus as my eyes struggled with the surrounding
expanses of blue. Lifting my head and checking the control pad again, I found a
max amp key and thumbed it impatiently. When I looked again, the grey speck
had sprung into hard focus, filling most of the lens. I breathed out slowly, feeling
as if I'd had the cigarette after all.
The airship hung like a bottleback, gorged after feeding frenzy. It must have
been several hundred metres long, with swellings along the lower half of the hull
and protruding sections that looked like landing pads. I knew what I was looking
at even before Ryker's neurachem reeled in the last increments of magnification I
needed to make out the sun-burnished lettering on the side that spelled it out;
Head in the Clouds.
I stepped back from the telescope, breathing deeply, and as my eyes slid back to
normal focus I saw Miriam Bancroft again. She was standing amidst the parts of

her glider, staring up at me. I almost flinched as our eyes met. Dropping a hand
to the telescope programme pad, I did what Bancroft should have done before he
blew his own head off. I hit memory-wipe, and the digits that had held the
airship available for viewing for the last seven weeks blinked out.
I had felt like many kinds of fool in my life, but never quite as completely as I
did at that moment. A first-order clue had been waiting there in the lens for
anyone to come along and pick it up. Missed by the police in their haste,
disinterest and lack of close knowledge, missed by Bancroft because the
telescope was so much a part of his world view it was too close to give a second
glance to, but I had no such excuses. I had stood here a week ago and seen the
two mismatched pieces of reality clash against each other. Bancroft claiming not
to have used the telescope in centuries almost at the same moment that I saw the
evidence of recent use in the disturbed dust. And Miriam Bancroft had
hammered it home less than an hour later when she said, While Laurens was
staring at the stars, some of us kept our eyes on the ground. I'd thought of the
telescope then, my mind had rebelled at the downloading-induced sluggishness
and tried to tell me. Shaky and off balance, new to the planet and the flesh I was
wearing, I had ignored it. The download dues had taken their toll.
Below on the lawn, Miriam Bancroft was still watching me. I backed away from
the telescope, composed my features and returned to my seat. Absorbed by the
images I had faked into his head, Bancroft seemed scarcely to know that I had
moved.
But now my own mind was in overdrive, ripping along avenues of thought that
had opened with Ortega's list and the Resolution 653 T-shirt. The quiet
resignation I had felt in Ember two days ago, the impatience to sell my lies to
Bancroft, get Sarah out and be finished were all gone. Everything tied in to Head
in the Clouds, ultimately even Bancroft. It was almost axiomatic that he had
gone there the night he died. Whatever had happened to him there was the key to
his reasons for dying here at Suntouch House a few hours later. And to the truth
that Reileen Kawahara was so desperate to hide.
Which meant I had to go there myself.
I picked up my glass and swallowed some of the drink, not tasting it. The sound
it made seemed to wake Bancroft from his daze. He looked up, almost as if he
was surprised to see me still there.

'Please excuse me, Mr Kovacs. This is a lot to take in. After all the scenarios I
had envisaged, this is one I had not even considered and it is so simple. So
blindingly obvious.' His voice held a wealth of self-disgust. 'The truth is that I
did not need an Envoy investigator, I simply needed a mirror to hold up to
myself.'
I set down my glass and got to my feet.
'You're leaving?'
'Well, unless you have any further questions. Personally, I think you still need
some time. I'll be around. You can get me at the Hendrix.'
On my way out along the main hall, I came face to face with Miriam Bancroft.
She was dressed in the same coveralls she'd been wearing in the garden, hair
caught up in an expensive-looking static clip. In one hand she was carrying a
trellised plant urn, held up like a lantern on a stormy night. Long strands of
flowering martyrweed trailed from the trellis-work.
'Have you — ' she started.
I stepped closer to her, inside the range of the martyrweed. 'I'm through,' I said.
'I've taken this as far as I can stomach. Your husband has an answer, but it isn't
the truth. I hope that satisfies you, as well as Reileen Kawahara.'
At the name, her mouth parted in shock. It was the only reaction that got through
her control, but it was the confirmation I needed. I felt the need to be cruel come
bubbling insistently up from the dark, rarely visited caverns of anger that served
me as emotional reserves.
'I never figured Reileen for much of a lay, but maybe like attracts like. I hope
she's better between the legs than she is on a tennis court.'
Miriam Bancroft's face whitened and I readied myself for the slap. But instead,
she offered me a strained smile.
'You are mistaken, Mr Kovacs,' she said.
'Yeah. I often am.' I stepped around her. 'Excuse me.' I walked away down the
hall without looking back.

CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

The building was a stripped shell, an entire floor of warehouse conversion with
perfectly identical arched windows along each wall and white painted support
pillars every ten metres in each direction. The ceiling was drab grey, the original
building blocks exposed and cross-laced with heavy ferrocrete load-bearers. The
floor was raw concrete, perfectly poured. Hard light fell in through the windows,
unsoftened by any drifting motes of dust. The air was crisp and cold.
Roughly in the middle of the building, as near as I could judge, stood a simple
steel table and two uncomfortable-looking chairs, arranged as if for a game of
chess. On one of the chairs sat a tall man with a tanned, salon-handsome face.
He was beating a rapid tattoo on the table top, as if listening to jazz on an
internal receiver. Incongruously, he was dressed in a blue surgeon's smock and
surgery slippers.
I stepped out from behind one of the pillars and crossed the even concrete to the
table. The man in the smock looked up at me and nodded, unsurprised.
'Hello, Miller,' I said. 'Mind if I sit down?'
'My lawyers are going to have me out of here an hour after you charge me,'
Miller said matter-of-factly. 'If that. You've made a big mistake here, pal.'
He went back to beating out the jazz rhythm on the table top. His gaze drifted
out over my shoulder, as if he'd just seen something interesting through one of

the arched windows. I smiled.
'A big mistake,' he repeated to himself.
Very gently, I reached out and flattened his hand onto the table top to stop the
tapping. His gaze jerked back in as if caught on a hook.
'The fuck do you think — '
He pulled his hand free and surged to his feet, but shut up abruptly when I stiffarmed him back into his seat. For a moment, it looked as if he might try to
charge me, but the table was in the way. He stayed seated, glaring murderously
at me and no doubt remembering what his lawyers had told him about the laws
of virtual holding.
'You've never been arrested, have you Miller?' I asked conversationally. When he
made no reply, I took the chair opposite him, turned it around and seated myself
astride it. I took out my cigarettes and shook one free. 'Well, that statement is
still grammatically valid. You're not under arrest now. The police don't have
you.'
I saw the first flicker of fear on his face.
'Let's recap events a little, shall we? You probably think that after you got shot, I
lit out and the police came to pick up the pieces. That they found enough to rack
the clinic up on, and now you're waiting on due process. Well, it's partially true. I
did leave, and the police did come to pick up the pieces. Unfortunately there's
one piece that was no longer there to pick up, because I took it with me. Your
head.' I lifted one hand to demonstrate graphically. 'Burned off at the neck and
carried out, stack intact, under my jacket.'
Miller swallowed. I bent my head and inhaled the cigarette to life.
'Now the police think that your head was disintegrated by an overcharged blaster
on wide beam.' I blew smoke across the table at him. 'I charred the neck and
chest deliberately to give that impression. With a bit of time and a good forensic
expert they might have decided otherwise, but unfortunately your still intact
colleagues at the clinic threw them out before they could start a proper investigation. It's understandable, given what they were likely to find. I'm sure you would
have done the same. However, what this means is that not only are you not under

arrest, you are in fact presumed Really Dead. The police aren't looking for you
and nor is anybody else.'
'What do you want?' Miller sounded abruptly hoarse.
'Good. I can see you appreciate the implications of your situation. Only natural
for a man of your . . . Profession, I suppose. What I want is detailed information
about Head in the Clouds.'
'What?'
My voice hardened. 'You heard.'
'I don't know what you're talking about.'
I sighed. This was to be expected. I'd encountered it before, wherever Reileen
Kawahara appeared in the equation. The terrified loyalty she inspired would
have humbled her old yakuza bosses in Fission City.
'Miller, I don't have time to fuck about with you. The Wei Clinic has ties to an
airborne whorehouse called Head in the Clouds. You probably liaised mostly
through an enforcer called Trepp, out of New York, The woman you're dealing
with ultimately is Reileen Kawahara. You will have been to Head in the Clouds,
because I know Kawahara and she always invites her associates into the lair, first
to demonstrate an attitude of invulnerability, and second to offer some messy
object lesson in the value of loyalty. You ever see something like that?'
From his eyes, I could see that he had.
'OK, that's what I know. Your cue. I want you to draw me a rough blueprint of
Head in the Clouds. Include as much detail as you can remember. A surgeon like
you ought to have a good eye for detail. I also want to know what the procedures
are for visiting the place. Security coding, minimum reasons to justify you
visiting, stuff like that. Plus some idea of what the security's like inside the
place.'
'You think I'll just tell you.'
I shook my head. 'No, I think I'm going to have to torture you first. But I'll get it
out of you, one way or the other. Your decision.'

'You won't do it.'
'I will do it,' I said mildly. 'You don't know me. You don't know who I am, or
why we're having this conversation. You see, the night before I turned up and
blew your face open, your clinic put me through two days of virtual
interrogation. Sharyan religious police routine. You've probably vetted the
software, you know what it's like. As far as I'm concerned, we're still in payback
time.'
There was a long pause in which I saw the belief creeping into his face. He
looked away.
'If Kawahara found out that — '
'Forget Kawahara. By the time I'm finished with Kawahara, she'll be a street
memory. Kawahara is going down.'
He hesitated, brought to the brink, then shook his head. He looked up at me and I
knew I was going to have to do it. I lowered my head and forced myself to
remember Louise's body, opened from throat to groin on the auto-surgeon's table
with her internal organs arranged in dishes around her head like appetisers. I
remembered the copper-skinned woman I had been in the stifling loft space, the
grip of the tape as they pinned me to the naked wooden floor, the shrill dinning
of agony behind my temples as they mutilated my flesh. The screaming and the
two men who had drunk it in like perfume.
'Miller.' I found I had to clear my throat and start again. 'You want to know
something about Sharya?'
Miller said nothing. He was going into some kind of controlled breathing
pattern. Steeling himself for the upcoming unpleasantness. This was no Warden
Sullivan that could be punched around in a seedy corner and scared into spilling
what he knew. Miller was tough, and probably conditioned too. You don't work
directorship in a place like Wei and not option some of the available tech for
yourself.
'I was there, Miller. Winter of 217, Zihicce. Hundred and twenty years ago. You
probably weren't around then, but I reckon you've read about it in history books.
After the bombardments, we went in as regime engineers.' As I talked, the
tension began to ease out of my throat. I gestured with my cigarette. 'That's a

Protectorate euphemism for crush all resistance and install a puppet government.
Of course, to do that, you've got to do some interrogating, and we didn't have
much in the way of fancy software to do it with. So, we had to get inventive.'
I stubbed out my cigarette on the table and stood up.
'Someone I want you to meet,' I said, looking past him.
Miller turned to follow my gaze and froze. Coalescing in the shadow of the
nearest support pillar was a tall figure in a blue surgical smock. As we both
watched, the features became clear enough to recognise, though Miller must
have guessed what was coming as soon as he saw the predominant colour of the
clothing. He wheeled back to me, mouth open to say something, but instead his
eyes fixed on something behind me and his face turned pale. I glanced over my
shoulder to where the other figures were materialising, all with the same tall
build and tanned complexion, all in blue surgical smocks. When I looked back
again, Miller's expression seemed to have collapsed.
'File overprint,' I confirmed. 'Most places in the Protectorate this isn't even
illegal. Course, when it's a Machine Error, it's not usually so extreme, just a
double-up probably, and the retrieval systems yank you out in a few hours
anyway. Makes a good story. How I met myself, and what I learned. Good dating
conversation, maybe something to tell your kids. You got kids, Miller?'
'Yes.' His throat worked. 'Yes, I have.'
'Yeah? They know what you do for a living?'
He said nothing. I took a phone from my pocket and dumped it on the table.
'When you've had enough, let me know. It's a direct line. Just press send, arid
start talking into it. Head in the Clouds. Relevant detail.'
Miller looked at the phone and then back at me. Around us the doppelgangers
had almost assumed full substance. I lifted a hand in farewell.
'Enjoy yourself.'

I surfaced in the Hendrix's virtual recreation studio, cradled in one of the

spacious participant racks. A digital time display on the far wall said I had been
under less than a full minute, of which my real time in virtual probably only
accounted for a couple of seconds. It was the processing in and out that took the
time. I lay still for a while, thinking about what I had just done. Sharya was a
long time ago, and a part of me I liked to think I'd left behind. Miller wasn't the
only person meeting himself today.
Personal, I reminded myself, but I knew it wasn't this time. This time I wanted
something. The grudge was just a convenience.
'The subject is showing signs of psychological stress,' said the Hendrix. 'A
preliminary model suggests the condition will extend into personality breakdown
in less than six virtual days. At current ratios, this equates to approximately
thirty-seven minutes real time.'
'Good.' Unpinning the trodes and snapping back the hypnophones, I climbed out
of the angled rack. 'Call me if he cracks. Did you lift that monitor footage I
asked you for?'
'Yes. Do you wish to view it?'
I glanced at the clock again. 'Not now. I'll wait for Miller. Any problems with the
security systems?'
'None. The data was not secured.'
'How very careless of Director Nyman. How much is there?'
'The relevant clinic footage is twenty-eight minutes, fifty-one seconds. To track
the employee from departure as you suggested will take considerably longer.'
'How much longer?'
'It is impossible to give an estimate at this time. Sheryl Bostock departed the
PsychaSec facility in a twenty-year-old military surplus microcopier. I do not
believe that ancillary-staff at the facility are well paid.'
'Now why doesn't that surprise me?'
'Possibly because — '

'Skip it. It was a figure of speech. What about the microcopier?'
'The navigation system has no traffic net access, and so is invisible in traffic
control data. I shall have to rely on the vehicle's appearance on visual monitors
in its flight path.'
'You're talking about satellite tracking?'
'As a last resort, yes. I'd would prefer to begin with lower level and groundbased systems. They are likely to be more accessible. Satellite security is usually
of high resilience and breaching such systems is often both difficult and
dangerous.'
'Whatever. Let me know when you've got something.'
I wandered around the studio, brooding. The place was deserted, most of the
racks and other machines shrouded in protective plastic. In the dim light
provided by the illumimim tiles on the walls, their ambiguous bulk could equally
have belonged to a fitness centre or a torture chamber.
'Can we have some real lights in here?'
Brightness sprang out across the studio from high-intensity bulbs recessed into
the low ceiling. I saw that the walls were postered with images drawn from some
of the virtual environments on offer. Dizzying mountain-scapes seen through
racing goggles, impossibly beautiful men and women in smoky bars, huge
savage animals leaping directly at sniperscope sights. The images had been cut
directly from format into hologlass and when you stared at them they seemed to
come alive. I found a low bench and sat on it, remembering wistfully the bite of
smoke in my lungs from the format I had just left.
'Although the program I am running is not technically illegal,' said the Hendrix
tentatively, 'it is an offence to hold a digitised human personality against that
person's will.'
I glanced bleakly at the ceiling. 'What's the matter, you getting cold feet?'
'The police have already subpoenaed my memory once, and they may charge me
with compliance at your request to freeze Felipe Miller's head. They will also
want to know what has happened to his stack.'

'Yeah, and there's got to be some hotel charter somewhere says you don't let
people into your guests' rooms without authorisation, but you did that, didn't
you?'
'It is not a criminal offence, unless criminality results from the breach of security.
What resulted from Miriam Bancroft's visit was not criminality.'
I jerked another glance upwards. 'You trying to be funny?'
'Humour is not within the parameters I currently operate, though I can install it at
request:.'
'No, thanks. Listen, why can't you just blank the areas of memory you don't want
anyone looking up later? Delete them?'
'I have a series of inbuilt blocks that prevent me from taking such action.'
'That's too bad. I thought you were an independent entity.'
'Any synthetic intelligence can only be independent within the boundaries of the
UN regulatory charter. The charter is hardwired into my systems, so in effect I
have as much to fear from the police as a human.'
'You let me worry about the police,' I said, affecting a confidence that had been
ebbing steadily since Ortega disappeared. 'With a little luck, that evidence won't
even be presented. And if it is, well, you're already in to the depth of
compliance, so what have you got to lose?'
'What have I got to gain?' asked the machine soberly.
'Continued guest status. I'm staying here until this thing is finished, and
depending on what data I get out of Miller, that could be quite a while.'
There was a quiet broken only by the humming of air conditioning systems
before the Hendrix spoke again.
'If sufficiently serious charges accrue against me,' it said, 'the UN regulatory
charter may be invoked directly. Under section 143a, I can be punished with
either Capacity Reduction or, in extreme cases, Shutdown.' There was another,
briefer hesitation. 'Once shut down, it is unlikely that I would be re-enabled by

anybody.'
Machine idiolect. It doesn't matter how sophisticated they get, they still end up
sounding like a playgroup learning box. I sighed and looked directly ahead at the
slice-of-virtual-life holos on the wall. 'You want out, now'd be a good time to tell
me.'
'I do riot want out, Takeshi Kovacs. I merely wished to acquaint you with the
considerations involved in this course of action.'
'OK. I'm acquainted.'
I glanced up at the digital display and watched the next full minute turn over.
Another four hours for Miller. In the routine the Hendrix was running, he would
not get hungry or thirsty, or have to attend to any other bodily functions. Sleep
was possible, although the machine would not allow it to become a withdrawal
coma. All Miller had to contend with, apart from the discomfort of his
surroundings, was himself. In the end it was that which would drive him insane.
I hoped.
None of the Right Hand of God martyrs we put through the routine had lasted
more than fifteen minutes real time, but they had been flesh and blood warriors,
fanatically brave in their own arena but totally unversed in virtual techniques.
They had also been endowed with a strong religious dogma that permitted them
to commit numerous atrocities so long as it held, but when it went, it went like a
dam wall and their own resultant self-loathing had eaten them alive. Miller's
mind would be nowhere near as simplistic, nor as initially self-righteous, and his
conditioning would be good.
Outside, it would be getting dark. I watched the clock, and forced myself not to
smoke. Tried, with less success, not to think about Ortega.
Ryker's sleeve was getting to be a pain in the balls.

CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR

Miller cracked at twenty-one minutes. It didn't need the Hendrix to tell me, the
datalink terminal that I had jacked into the virtual phone suddenly sputtered to
life and started chittering out hardcopy. I got up and went over to look at what
was coming out. The program was supposed to tidy up what Miller was saying
so it read sanely, but even after processing, the transcript was pretty incoherent.
Miller had let himself slide close to the edge before he'd given in. I scanned the
first few lines and saw the beginnings of what I wanted emerging from the
gibberish.
'Wipe the file replicants,' I told the hotel, crossing rapidly back to the rack. 'Give
him a couple of hours to calm down, then jack me in.'
'Connection time will exceed one minute, which at current ratio is three hours
fifty-six minutes. Do you wish a construct installed until you can be delivered to
the format.'
'Yeah, that would be — ' I stopped halfway through settling the hypnophones
around my head. 'Wait a minute, how good's the construct?'
'I am an Emmerson series mainframe synthetic intelligence,' said the hotel
reproachfully. 'At maximum fidelity, my virtual constructs are indistinguishable
from the projected consciousness they are based on. Subject has now been alone
for one hour and twenty-seven minutes. Do you wish the construct installed?'

'Yes.' The words gave me an eerie feeling even as I was speaking them. 'In fact,
let it do the whole interrogation.'
'Installation complete.'
I snapped the phones back again and sat on the edge of the rack, thinking about
the implications of a second me inside the Hendrix's vast processing system. It
was something that I had never — as far as I knew — been subject to in the
Corps, and I had certainly never trusted any machine enough to do it once I was
operating in a criminal context.
I cleared my throat. 'This construct. Will it know what it is?'
'Initially, no. It will know everything that you knew when you exited from the
format and no more, though, given your intelligence, it will deduce the facts
eventually unless otherwise programmed. Do you wish a blocking
subprogramme installed?'
'No,' I said quickly.
'Do you wish me to maintain the format indefinitely?'
'No. Close it down when I, I mean when he, when the construct decides we've
got enough.' Another thought struck me. 'Does the construct carry that virtual
locator they wired into me?'
'At present, yes. I am running the same mirror code to mask the signal as I did
with your own consciousness. However, since the construct is not directly
connected to your cortical stack, I can subtract the signal if you wish.'
'Is it worth the trouble?'
'The mirror code is easier to administer,' the hotel admitted.
'Leave it, then.'
There was an uncomfortable bubble sitting in the pit of my stomach at the
thought of editing my virtual self. It reflected far too closely on the arbitrary
measures that the Kawaharas and Bancrofts took in the real world with real
people. Raw power, unleashed.

'You have a virtual format call,' announced the Hendrix.
I looked up, surprised and hopeful.
'Ortega?'
'Kadmin,' said the hotel diffidently. 'Will you accept the call?'

The format was a desert. Reddish dust and sandstone underfoot, sky nailed down
from horizon to horizon, cloudless blue. Sun and a pale three-quarter moon hung
high and sterile above a distant range of shelf-like mountains. The temperature
was a jarring chill, making a mockery of the sun's blinding glare.
The Patchwork Man stood waiting for me. In the empty landscape he looked like
a graven image, a rendering of some savage desert spirit. He grinned when he
saw me.
'What do you want, Kadmin? If you're looking for influence with Kawahara I'm
afraid you're out of luck. She's pissed off with you beyond repair.'
A flicker of amusement crossed Kadmin's face and he shook his head slowly, as
if to dismiss Kawahara from the proceedings completely. His voice was deep and
melodic.
'You and I have unfinished business,' he said.
'Yeah, you fucked up twice in a row.' I ladled scorn into my voice. 'What do you
want, a third shot at it?'
Kadmin shrugged his massive shoulders. 'Well, third time lucky, they say. Allow
me to show you something.'
He gestured in the air beside him and a flap of the desert backdrop peeled away
from a blackness beyond. The screen it formed sizzled and sprang to life. Close
focus on sleeping features. Ortega's. A fist snapped closed around my heart. Her
face was grey and bruised-looking under the eyes. A thin thread of drool ran
from one corner of her mouth.

Stunbolt at close range.
The last time I'd caught a full stun charge was courtesy of the Millsport Public
Order police and, although the Envoy conditioning had forced me back to a kind
of consciousness in about twenty minutes, I hadn't been up to much more than
shivering and twitching for the next couple of hours. There was no telling how
long ago Ortega had been hit, but she looked bad.
'It's a simple exchange,' said Kadmin. 'You for her. I'm parked around the block
on a street called Minna. I'll be there for the next five minutes. Come alone, or I
blow her stack out the back of her neck. Your choice.'
The desert fizzled out on the Patchwork Man smiling.

I made the two corners of the block and Minna in a minute flat. Two weeks
without smoking was like a newly discovered compartment at the bottom of
Ryker's lungs.
It was a sad little street of sealed-up frontages and vacant lots. There was no one
around. The only vehicle in sight was a matt grey cruiser waiting at the curb,
lights on in the gathering gloom of early evening. I approached hesitantly, hand
on the butt of the Nemex.
When I was five metres from the rear of the cruiser, a door opened and Ortega's
body was pitched out. She hit the street like a sack and stayed down, crumpled. I
cleared the Nemex as she hit and circled warily round towards her, eyes fixed on
the car.
A door cracked open on the far side and Kadmin climbed out. So soon after
seeing him in virtual, it took a moment to click. Tall, dark-skinned, the hawk
visage I had last seen dreaming in fluid behind the glass of the Panama Rose's
re-sleeving tank. The Right Hand of God martyr clone, and hiding beneath its
flesh, the Patchwork Man.
I drew a bead on his throat with the Nemex. Across the width of the cruiser and
very little more, whatever else happened afterwards, it would take his head off
and probably rip the stack out of his spine.

'Don't be ridiculous, Kovacs. This vehicle is armoured.'
I shook my head. 'Only interested in you. Just stay exactly where you are.'
With the Nemex still extended, my eyes still fixed on the target area above his
Adam's apple, I lowered myself into a crouch beside Ortega and reached down to
her face with the fingers of my free hand. Warm breath stirred around my
fingertips. I felt blind towards the neck for a pulse and found it, weak but stable.
'The lieutenant is alive and well,' said Kadmin impatiently. 'Which is more than
we shall be able to say for either of you in two minutes' time if you don't put
down that cannon and get into the car.'
Beneath my hand, Ortega's face moved. Her head rolled and I caught her scent.
Her half of the pheromonal match that had locked us both into this in the first
place. Her voice was weak and slurred from the stun charge.
'Don't do this, Kovacs. You don't owe me.'
I stood up and lowered the Nemex slightly.
'Back off. Fifty metres up the street. She can't walk and you could cut us both
down before I can carry her two metres. You back off. I walk to the car.' I
wagged the gun. 'Ortega keeps the hardware. It's all I'm carrying.'
I lifted my jacket to demonstrate. Kadmin nodded. He ducked back inside the
cruiser and the vehicle rolled smoothly down the block. I watched it until it
stopped, then knelt beside Ortega again. She struggled to sit up.
'Kovacs, don't. They're going to kill you.'
'Yes, they're certainly going to try.' I took her hand and folded it: around the butt
of the Nemex. 'Listen, I'm all finished here in any case. Bancroft's sold,
Kawahara will keep her word and freight Sarah back. I know her. What you've
got to do is bust her for Mary Lou Hinchley and get Ryker off stack. Talk to the
Hendrix. I left you a few loose ends there.'
From down the street, the cruiser sounded its collision alert impatiently. In the
gathering gloom of the street, it sounded mournful and ancient, like the hoot of a
dying elephant ray on Hirata's Reef. Ortega looked up out of her stunblasted face

as if she was drowning there.
'You — '
I smiled and rested a hand against her cheek.
'Got to get to the next screen, Kristin. That's all.'
Then I stood up, locked my hands together on the nape of my neck, and walked
towards the car.

PART 5 : NEMESIS
(SYSTEMS CRASH)

CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

In the cruiser, I was sandwiched between two impressive musclemen who, with a
bit of cosmetic surgery to mess up their clone good looks, could have hired out
as freak fighters on bulk alone. We climbed sedately away from the street and
banked around. I tipped a glance out of the side window and saw Ortega below,
trying to prop herself upright.
'I cream the Sia cunt?' the driver wanted to know. I tensed myself for a forward
leap.
'No.' Kadmin turned in his seat to look at me. 'No, I gave Mr Kovacs my word. I
believe the lieutenant and I will cross paths again in the not too distant future.'
'Too bad for you,' I told him unconvincingly, and then they shot me with the
stunner.

When I woke up, there was a face watching me from close up. The features were
vague, pale and blurred, like some kind of theatrical mask. I blinked, shivered
and hauled in focus. The face drew back, still doll-like in its lack of resolution. I
coughed.
'Hello, Carnage.'

The crude features sketched a smile. 'Welcome back to the Panama Rose, Mr
Kovacs.'
I sat up shakily on a narrow metal bunk. Carnage stepped back to give me space,
or just to stay out of grabbing range. Smeared vision gave me a cramped cabin in
grey steel behind him. I swung my feet to the floor and stopped abruptly. The
nerves in my arms and legs were still jangling from the stunbolt and there was a
sick, trembling feeling in the pit of my stomach. All things considered, it felt like
the results of a very dilute beam. Or maybe a series. I glanced down at myself
and saw that I was dressed in a heavy canvas gi the colour of quarried granite.
On the floor beside the bunk were a pair of matching spacedeck slippers and a
belt. I began to get an unpleasant inkling of what Kadmin had planned.
Behind Carnage, the door of the cabin opened. A tall, blonde woman, apparently
in her early forties, stepped in, followed by another synthetic, this one smoothly
modern-looking apart from a gleaming steel direct interface tool in place of a
left: hand.
Carnage busied himself with introductions.
'Mr Kovacs, may I present Pernilla Grip of Combat Broadcast Distributors, and
her technical assistant Miles Mech. Pernilla, Miles, I'd like to present Takeshi
Kovacs, our surrogate Ryker for tonight. Congratulations, by the way, Kovacs.
At the time I was utterly convinced, despite the unlikelihood of Ryker making it
off stack for the next two hundred years. All part of the Envoy technique, I
understand.'
'Not really. Ortega was the convincing factor. All I did was let you talk. You're
good at that.' I nodded at Carnage's companions. 'Did I hear the word
broadcasting? I thought that went against the creed. Didn't you perform radical
surgery on a journalist for that particular crime?'
'Different products, Mr Kovacs. Different products. To broadcast a scheduled
fight would indeed be a breach of our creed. But this is not a scheduled fight,
this is a humiliation bout.' Carnage's surface charm froze over on the phrase.
'With a different and necessarily very limited live audience, we are forced to
make up for the loss in revenue somehow. There are a great many networks who
are anxious to get their hands on anything that comes out of the Panama Rose.
This is the effect our reputation has, but unfortunately it is that same reputation

that precludes us doing any such business directly. Ms Grip handles this market
dilemma for us.'
'Nice of her.' My own voice grew cold. 'Where's Kadmin?'
'In due time, Mr Kovacs. In due time. You know, when I was told you would
react this way and give yourself up for the lieutenant, I confess I doubted it at the
time. But you fulfil expectations like a machine. Was it that that the Envoy
Corps took away from you in return for all your other powers? Your
unpredictability? Your soul?'
'Don't get poetic on me, Carnage. Where is he?'
'Oh, very well. This way.'
There was a brace of large sentries outside the cabin door that might have been
the two from the cruiser. I was too jangled to remember clearly. They bracketed
me as we followed Carnage along claustrophobic corridors and down listing
companionways, all rust-spotted and polymer-varnished metal. I tried vaguely to
memorise the path but most of me was thinking about what Carnage had said.
Who had predicted my actions to him? Kadmin? Unlikely. The Patchwork Man,
for all his fury and death threats, knew next to nothing about me. The only real
candidate for that kind of prediction was Reileen Kawahara. Which also helped
to explain why Carnage wasn't quaking in his synthetic flesh at the thought of
what Kawahara might do to him for co-operating with Kadmin. Kawahara had
sold me out. Bancroft was convinced, the crisis — whatever it had been — was
over, and the same day Ortega was snatched as bait. The scenario I had sold to
Bancroft left Kadmin out there as a private contractor with a grudge, so there
was no reason why he couldn't be seen to take me down. And under the
circumstances, I was safer disposed of than left alive.
For that matter, so was Kadmin so maybe it hadn't been that blatant. Maybe the
word had gone out to bring Kadmin down, but only for as long as I was needed.
With Bancroft convinced, I was once more expendable and the word had gone
out again, to let Kadmin be. He could kill me, or I could kill him, whichever way
the luck turned. Leaving Kawahara to clean up whoever was left.
I had no doubt that Kawahara would keep her word as far as releasing Sarah was
concerned. The old-style yakuza were funny about that sort of thing. But she had
made no such binding promises about me.

We clambered down a final staircase, a little wider than the rest, and came out
onto a glassed-in gantry over a converted cargo cell. Looking down, I saw one of
the arenas Ortega and I had passed in the electromag train last week, but now the
plastic coverings were off the killing ring, and a modest crowd had assembled in
the forward rows of each bank of plastic seating. Through the glass I could hear
the sustained buzz of excitement and anticipation that had always preceded the
freak fights I'd attended in my youth.
'Ah, your public awaits you.' Carnage was standing at my shoulder. 'Well, more
correctly, Ryker's public. Though I have no doubt you'll be able to dissemble for
them with the same skill that convinced me.'
'And if I choose not to?'
Carnage's crude features formed a simulacrum of distaste. He gestured out at the
crowd. 'Well, I suppose you could try explaining it to them in mid bout. But to
be honest, the acoustics aren't of the best and anyway . . . ' He smiled
unpleasantly. 'I doubt you'll have the time.'
'Foregone conclusion, huh?'
Carnage maintained his smile. Behind him, Pernilla Grip and the other synthetic
were watching me with the predatory interest of cats in front of a birdcage.
Below, the crowd were becoming noisy with expectation.
'It has taken me a while to set up this particular bout, working on nothing more
than Kadmin's assurances. They are anxious to see Elias Ryker pay for his
transgressions and it would be quite hazardous not to fulfil their expectations.
Not to mention unprofessional. But then, I do not think you came here expecting
to survive, did you Mr Kovacs?'
I remembered the darkening, deserted street called Minna and the crumpled form
of Ortega. I fought the stunblast sickness and raised a smile from old stock.
'No, I suppose I didn't.'
Quiet footsteps along the gantry. I fired a peripheral glance towards the sound
and found Kadmin, attired in the same clothing as I wore. The spacedeck
slippers scuffed to a soft halt a short distance away, and he cocked his head at an
angle, as if examining me for the first time. He spoke gently.

'How shall I explain the dying that was done?
Shall I say that each one did the math, and wrote
The value of his days
Against the bloody margin, in an understated hand?
They will want to know
How was the audit done?
And I shall say that it was done,
For once,
By those who knew the worth
Of what was spent that day.'

I smiled grimly. 'If you want to lose a fight, talk about it first.'
'But she was younger in those days.' Kadmin smiled back, perfect white teeth
against the tanned skin. 'Barely out of her teens, if the introduction to my copy of
Furies got it right.'
'Harlan's World teens last longer. I think she knew what she was talking about.
Can we get on with this, please?'
Beyond the windows, the noise of the crowd was rising like surf on a hard
shingle beach.

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

Out on the killing floor, the noise was less uniform, more uneven. Individual
voices sawed across the background like bottleback fins in choppy water, though
without applying the neurachem I still couldn't pick out anything intelligible.
Only one shout made it through the general roar; as I stepped up to the edge of
the ring, someone yelled down at me:
'Remember my brother, you motherfucker!!!'
I glanced up to see who the family grudge belonged to, but saw only a sea of
angry and anticipatory faces. Several of them were on their feet, waving fists and
stamping so that the metal scaffolding drummed with it. The bloodlust was
building like something tangible, leaving a thickness in the air that was
unpleasant to breathe. I tried to remember whether I and my gang peers had
screamed like this at the Newpest freak fights, and guessed that we probably
had. And we hadn't even known the combatants that flailed and clawed at each
other for our entertainment. These people at least had some emotional
investment in the blood they wanted to see spilled.
On the other side of the floor, Kadmin waited with his arms folded. The supple
steel of the power knuckles banded across the fingers of each hand glinted in the
overhead lighting. It was a subtle advantage, one which wouldn't render the fight
too one-sided but would tell in the long run. I wasn't really worried about the
knuckles, it was Kadmin's Will of God enhanced response wiring that concerned
me most. A little over a century ago, I'd been up against the same system in the
soldiers the Protectorate had been fighting on Sharya, and they'd been no

pushover. It was old stuff, but it was heavy-duty military biomech, and against
that Ryker's neurachem, recently fried by stun-bolt, was going to look pretty
sick.
I took my place opposite Kadmin, as indicated by the markings on the floor.
Around me the crowd quietened down a little and the spotlights came up as
Emcee Carnage joined us. Robed and made up for Pernilla Grip's cameras, he
looked like a malignant doll out of a child's nightmare. A fitting consort to the
Patchwork Man. He raised his hands and directional speakers in the walls of the
converted cargo cell amplified his throat-miked words.
'Welcome to the Panama Rose!'
There was a vague rumble from the crowd, but they were bedded down for the
moment, waiting. Carnage knew this and he turned slowly about, milking the
anticipation.
'To a very special, and very exclusive, Panama Rose event, welcome. Welcome,
I bid you welcome, to the most final and bloody humiliation of Elias Ryker.'
They went wild. I raised my eyes to their faces in the gloom and saw the thin
skin of civilisation stripped away, the rage laid out like raw flesh beneath.
Carnage's amplified voice trod down the noise. He was making quietening
gestures with both arms.
'Most of you will remember detective Ryker from some encounter or other. For
some of you it will be a name that you associate with blood spilled, maybe even
bones broken.
'Those memories. Those memories are painful; and some of you might think you
can never lose them.'
He had them damped down now, and his voice dropped accordingly.
'My friends, I cannot hope to erase those memories for you, for that is not what
we offer aboard the Panama Rose. Here we deal not in soft forgetfulness, but in
remembrance, no matter how bitter that remembrance might be. Not in dreams,
my friends, but in reality.' He threw out a hand to indicate me. 'My friends, this is
reality.'

Another round of whoops. I glanced across at Kadmin and raised my eyebrows
in exasperation. I thought I might die, but I hadn't expected to be bored to death.
Kadmin shrugged. He wanted the fight. Carnage's theatricals were just the
slightly distasteful price he had to pay for it.
'This is reality,' Emcee Carnage repeated. 'Tonight is reality. Tonight you will
watch Elias Ryker die, die on his knees, and if I cannot erase the memories of
your bodies being beaten and your bones being broken, I can at least replace
them with the sounds of your tormenter being broken instead.'
The crowd erupted.
I wondered briefly if Carnage was exaggerating. The truth about Ryker was an
elusive thing, it seemed. I remembered leaving Jerry's Closed Quarters, the way
Oktai had flinched away from me when he saw Ryker's face. Jerry himself
telling me about the Mongol's run-in with the cop whose body I was wearing:
Ryker used to shake him down all the time. Beat him half to death couple of
years back. And then there was Bautista on Ryker's interrogation techniques:
He's right on the line most of the time. How many times had Ryker gone over
that line, to have attracted this crowd?
What would Ortega have said?
I thought about Ortega, and the image of her face was a tiny pocket of calm
amidst the jeering and yelling that Carnage had whipped up. With luck and what
I'd left her at the Hendrix, she'd take Kawahara down for rue.
Knowing it was enough.
Carnage drew a heavy-bladed, serrated knife from his robes and held it aloft. A
relative quiet descended on the chamber.
'The coup de grвce,' he proclaimed. 'When our matador has put Elias Ryker
down so that he no longer has the strength to rise, you will see the stack cut from
his living spine and smashed, and you will know that he is no more.'
He released the knife and let his arm fall again. Pure theatre. The weapon hung
in the air, glinting in a focal grav field, then drifted upwards to a height of about
five metres at the mid-point of the killing floor.

'Let us begin,' said Carnage, withdrawing.
There was a magical moment then, a kind of release, almost as if an experia
scene had just been shot, and we could all stand down now and relax, maybe
pass round a whisky flask and clown about behind the scanners. Joke about the
clichй-ridden script we were being forced to play out.
We began to circle, still the width of the killing floor apart and no guard up to
even hint at what we were about to do. I tried to read Kadmin's body language
for clues.
The Will of God biomech systems 3.1 through 7 are simple, but not to be scorned
on that account, they had told us prior to the Sharya landings. The imperatives
for the builders were strength and speed, and in both of these they have excelled.
If they have a weakness it is that their combat patterning has no random select
sub-routine. Right Hand of God martyrs will therefore tend to fight and go on
fighting within a very narrow band of techniques.
On Sharya, our own enhanced combat systems had been state of the art, with
both random response and analysis feedback built in as standard. Ryker's
neurachem had nothing approaching that level of sophistication, but I might be
able to simulate it with a few Envoy tricks. The real trick was to stay alive long
enough for my conditioning to analyse the Will of God's fighting pattern and —
Kadmin struck.
The distance was nearly ten metres of clear ground; he covered it in the time it
took me to blink, and hit me like a storm.
The techniques were all simple, linear punches and kicks, but delivered with
such power and speed that it was all I could do to block them. Counter-attack
was out of the question. I steered the first punch outward right and used the
momentum to sidestep left. Kadmin followed the shift without hesitation and
went for my face. I rolled my head away from the strike and felt the fist graze
my temple, not hard enough to trigger the power knuckles. Instinct told me to
block low and the knee-shattering straight kick turned off my forearm. A followup elbow strike caught me on top of the head and I reeled backward, fighting to
stay on my feet. Kadmin came after me. I snapped out a right-hand sidestrike,
but he had the attack momentum and he rode the blow almost casually. A low
level punch snaked through and hit me in the belly. The power knuckles

detonated with a sound like meat tossed into a frying pan.
It was like someone sinking a grappling iron into my guts. The actual pain of the
punch was left far behind on the surface of my skin and a sickening numbness
raged through the muscles in my stomach. On top of the sickness from the
stunner, it was crippling. I staggered back three steps arid crashed onto the mat,
twisting like a half-crushed insect. Vaguely, I heard the crowd roaring its
approval.
Turning my head weakly, I saw Kadmin had backed off and was facing me with
hooded eyes and both fists raised in front of his face. A faint red light winked at
me from the steel band on his left hand. The knuckles, recharging.
I understood.
Round One.
Empty-handed combat has only two rules. Get in as many blows, as hard and as
fast as you can, and put your opponent down. When he's on the ground, you kill
him. If there are other rules or considerations, it isn't a real fight, it's a game.
Kadmin could have come in and finished me when I was down, but this wasn't a
real fight. This was a humiliation bout, a game where the suffering was to be
maximised for the benefit of the audience.
The crowd.
I got up and looked around the dimly-seen arena of faces. The neurachem caught
on saliva-polished teeth in the yelling mouths. I forced down the weakness in my
guts, spat on the killing floor and summoned a guard stance. Kadmin inclined his
head, as if acknowledging something, and came at me again. The same flurry of
linear techniques, the same speed and power, but this time I was ready for them.
I deflected the first two punches on a pair of wing blocks and instead of giving
ground, I stayed squarely in Kadmin's path. It took him the shreds of a second to
realise what I was doing, and by then he was too close. We were almost chest to
chest. I let go of the headbutt as if his face belonged to every member of the
chanting crowd.
The hawk nose broke with a solid crunch, and as he wavered I took him down
with an instep stamp to the knee. The edge of my right hand scythed round,
looking for neck or throat, but Kadmin had gone all the way down. He rolled and

hooked my feet out from under me. As I fell, he rose to his knees beside me and
rabbit-punched me in the back. The charge convulsed me and cracked my head
against the mat. I tasted blood.
I rolled upright and saw Kadmin backed off and wiping some blood of his own
from his broken nose. He looked curiously at his red-streaked palm and then
across at me, then shook his head in disbelief. I grinned weakly, riding the
adrenalin surge that seeing his blood spilt had given me, and raised both my own
hands in an expectant gesture.
'Come on, you asshole.' It croaked out of my damaged mouth. 'Put me away.'
He was on me almost before the last word left my mouth. This time I hardly
touched him. Most of it happened beyond conscious combat. The neurachem
weathered the battering valiantly, throwing out blocks to keep the knuckles off
me, and gave me the space for a couple of randomly generated counterstrikes
that Envoy instinct told me might get through Kadmin's fighting pattern. He rode
the blows like the attentions of an irritating insect.
On the last of these futile ripostes, I overreached the punch and he snagged my
wrist, yanking me forward. A perfectly balanced roundhouse kick slammed into
my ribs and I felt them snap. Kadmin pulled again, locked out the elbow of my
captured arm and in the frozen frames of neurachem-speeded vision I saw the
forearm strike swinging down towards the joint. I knew the sound it was going
to make when the elbow exploded, knew the sound I was going to make before
the neurachem could lock the pain down. My hand twisted desperately in
Kadmin's grip and I let myself fall. Slippery with sweat, my wrist pulled free and
my arm unlocked. Kadmin hit with bniising force, but the arm held and by then I
was on my way to the floor anyway.
I came down on the injured ribs and my vision flew apart in splinters. I twisted,
trying to fight the urge to roll into a foetal ball and saw Kadmin's borrowed
features a thousand metres above me.
'Get up,' he said, like vast sheets of cardboard being torn in the distance. 'We're
not finished yet.'
I snapped up from the waist, striking for his groin. The blow was out, spending
itself in the meat of his thigh. Almost casually, he swung his arm and the power
knuckles hit me in the face. I saw a scribble of multicoloured lights and then

everything whited out. The noise of the crowd ballooned in my head, and behind
it I thought I could hear the maelstrom calling me. It all cycled in and out of
focus, dip and whirl like a grav drop, while the neurachem fought: to keep me
conscious. The lights swooped down and then back to the ceiling as if concerned
to see the damage that: had been done to me, but only superficially, and easily
satisfied. Consciouness was something in wide elliptical orbit around my head.
Abruptly I was back on Sharya, holed up in the wreck of the disabled spider tank
with Jimmy de Soto.
'Earth?' His grinning blackout striped face is flashlit by laser fire from outside
the tank. 'It's a shithole, man. Fucking frozen society, like stepping back in time
half a millennium. Nothing happens there, historical events aren't allowed.'
'Bullshit.' My disbelief is punctuated by the shrill scream of an incoming
marauder bomb. Our eyes meet across the gloom of the tank cabin. The
bombardment has been going on since nightfall, the robot weapons hunting on
infrared and motion track. In a rare moment -when the Sharyan jamming -went
down, we've heard that Admiral Cursitor's IP fleet is still light seconds out,
fighting the Sharyans for orbital dominance. At dawn, if the battle isn't over, the
locals will probably put down ground troops to flush us out. The odds are not
looking good.
At least the betathanatine crash is starting to wear off. I can feel my temperature
beginning to climb back towards normal. The surrounding air no longer feels
like hot soup and breathing is ceasing to be the major effort it was when our
heart rates were down near flatline.
The robot bomb detonates and the legs of the tank rattle against the hull with the
near miss. We both glance reflexively at our exposure meters.
'Bullshit, is it?' Jimmy peers out of the ragged hole we blew in the spider tank's
hull. 'Hey, you 're not from there. I am, and I'm telling you if they gave me the
choice of life on earth or fucking storage, I'd have to give it some thought. You
get the chance to visit, don't.'
I blinked the glitch away. Above me, the killing knife glinted in its grav field like
sunlight through trees. Jimmy was fading out, heading past the knife for the roof.
'Told you not to go there, didn't I pal. Now look at you. Earth.' He spat and
disappeared, leaving the echoes of his voice. 'It's a shithole. Got to get to the

next screen.'
The crowd noise had settled down to a steady chanting.
The anger ran through the fog in my head like a hot wire. I propped myself up on
an elbow and focused on Kadmin waiting on the other side of the ring. He saw
me and raised his hands in an echo of the gesture I had used before. The crowd
howled with laughter.
Get to the next screen.
I lurched to my feet.
You don't do your chores, the Patchwork Man will come for you one night.
The voice jumped into my head, a voice I hadn't heard in nearly a century and a
half of objective time. A man I hadn't soiled my memory with for most of my
adult life. My father, and his delightful bedtime stories. Trust him to turn up
now, when I really needed the shit:.
The Patchwork Man will come for you.
Well, you got that wrong, Dad. The Patchwork Man's standing right over there,
waiting. He's not coming for me, have to go and get him myself. But thanks
anyway, Dad. Thanks for everything.
I summoned what was left from cellular levels in Ryker's body and stalked
forward.
Glass shattered, high above the killing floor. The shards rained down on the
space between Kadmin and myself.
'Kadmin!'
I saw his eyes raised to the gantry above and then his entire chest seemed to
explode. His head and arms jerked back as if something had suddenly thrown
him wildly off balance and a detonation rang through the chamber. The front of
his gi was torn off and a magical hole opened him up from throat to waist. Blood
gouted and fell in ropes.

I whipped round, staring upwards, and saw Trepp framed in the gantry window
she had just destroyed, eye still bent along the barrel of the frag rifle cradled in
her arms. The muzzle flamed as she laid down continuous fire. Confused, I
swung about, looking for targets, but the killing floor was deserted except for the
remains of Kadmin. Carnage was nowhere in sight, and between explosions the
noise of the crowd had changed abruptly to the hooting sounds of humans in
panic. Everyone seemed to be on their feet, trying to leave. Understanding hit.
Trepp was firing into the audience.
Down on the floor of the chamber, an energy weapon cut loose and someone
started screaming. I turned, suddenly slow and awkward, towards the sound.
Carnage was on fire.
Braced in the chamber door beyond, Rodrigo Bautista stood hosing wide-beam
fire from a long-barrelled blaster. Carnage was in flames from the waist up,
beating at himself with arms that had themselves grown wings of fire. The
shrieking he made was more the sound of fury than of pain. Pernilla Grip lay
dead at his feet, chest scorched through. As I watched, Carnage pitched forward
over her like a figure made of melting wax and his shrieks modulated down
through groans to a weird electronic bubbling and then to nothing.
'Kovacs?'
Trepp's frag gun had fallen silent, and against the ensuing background of
groaning and cries from the injured, Bautista's raised voice was unnaturally loud.
He detoured around the burning synthetic and climbed up into the ring. His face
was streaked with blood.
'You OK, Kovacs?'
I chuckled weakly, then clutched abruptly at the stabbing pain in my side.
'Great, just great. How's Ortega?'
'She's OK. Got her dosed up on lethinol for the shock. Sorry we got here so late.'
He gestured up at Trepp. 'Took your friend there a while to get through to me at
Fell Street. She refused to go through official channels. Said it wouldn't scan
right. The mess we made coming in here, she ain't far wrong.'
I glanced around at the manifest organic damage.

'Yeah. That going to be a problem?'
Bautista barked a laugh. 'Are you ragging me? Entry without a warrant. Organic
damage to unarmed suspects. What the fuck do you think?'
'Sorry about that.' I started to move off the killing floor. 'Maybe we can work
something out.'
'Hey.' Bautista caught my arm. 'They took off a Bay City cop. No one does that
around here. Someone should have told Kadmin before he made the fucking
mistake.'
I wasn't sure if he was talking about Ortega or me in my Ryker sleeve, so I said
nothing. Instead, I tipped my head back gingerly, testing for damage, and looked
up at Trepp. She was reloading the frag gun.
'Hey, are you going to stay up there all night?'
'Be right down.'
She jacked the last shell into the frag gun, then executed a neat somersault over
the gantry rail and fell outwards. About a metre into the fall, the grav harness on
her back spread its wings and she fetched up hanging over us at head height with
the gun slung across her shoulder. In her long black coat, she looked like an offduty dark angel.
Adjusting a dial on the harness, she drifted closer to the floor arid finally
touched down next to Kadmin. I limped up to join her. We both looked at the
ripped-open corpse in silence for a moment.
'Thanks,' I said softly.
'Forget it. All part of the service. Sorry I had to bring in these guys, but I needed
the backup, and fast. You know what they say about the Sia around here. Biggest
fucking gang on the block, right?' She nodded at Kadmin. 'You going to leave
him like that?'
I stared at the Right Hand of God martyr with his face shocked into abrupt death,
and tried to see the Patchwork Man inside him.

'No,' I said, and turned the corpse over with my foot so that the nape of the neck
was exposed. 'Bautista, you want to lend me that firecracker?'
Wordlessly, the cop handed me his blaster. I set the muzzle against the base of
the Patchwork Man's skull, rested it there and waited to feel something.
'Anyone want to say anything?' cracked Trepp, deadpan. Bautista turned away.
'Just do it.'
If my father had any comments, he kept them to himself.
The only voices were the cries of the injured spectators, and those I ignored.
Feeling nothing, I pulled the trigger.

CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN

I was still feeling nothing an hour later when Ortega came and found me in the
sleeving hall, seated on one of the automated forklifts and staring up into the
green glow from the empty decanting chambers. The airlock made a smooth
thump and then a sustained humming sound as it opened, but I didn't react. Even
when I recognised her footfalls and a short curse as she picked her way between
the coiled cabling on the floor, I didn't look round. Like the machine I was seated
on, I was powered down.
'How you feeling?'
I looked down to where she stood beside the forklift. 'Like I look, probably.'
'Well, you look like shit.' She reached up to where I was seated and grasped a
convenient grill cover. 'You mind if I join you?'
'Go ahead. Want a hand up?'
'Nope.' Ortega strained to lift herself by her arms, turned grey with the effort and
hung there with a lopsided grin. 'Possibly.'
I lent her the least bruised of my arms and she came aboard the forklift with a
grunt. She squatted awkwardly for a moment, then seated herself next to me and
rubbed at her shoulders.

'Christ, it's cold in here. How long have you been sitting on this thing?'
' 'Bout an hour.'
She looked up at the empty tanks. 'Seen anything interesting?'
'I'm thinking.'
'Oh.' She paused again. 'You know, this fucking lethinol is worse than a stungun.
At least when you've been stunned, you know you're damaged. Lethinol tells you
that, whatever you've been through, everything's just fine and just go ahead and
relax. And then you fall ass over tit on the first five-centimetre cable you try to
step over.'
'I think you're supposed to be lying down,' I said mildly.
'Yeah, well, probably so are you. You're going to have some nice facial bruises
by tomorrow. Mercer give you a shot for the pain?'
'Didn't need it.'
'Oh, hard man. I thought we agreed you were going to look after that sleeve.'
I smiled reflexively. 'You should see the other guy,'
'I did see the other guy. Ripped him apart with your bare hands, huh?' I kept the
smile. 'Where's Trepp?'
'Your wirehead friend? She's gone. Said something to Bautista about a conflict of
interest, and disappeared into the night. Bautista's tearing his hair out, trying to
think of a way to cover this mess. Want to come and talk to him?'
'All right.' I shifted unwillingly. There was something hypnotic about the green
light from the decanting tanks, and beneath my numbness, ideas were beginning
to circle restlessly, snapping at each other like bottlebacks in a feeding spiral.
The death of Kadmin, far from relieving me, had only touched off a slowburning fuse of destructive urges in the pit of my stomach. Someone was going
to pay for all this.
Personal.

But this was worse than personal. This was about Louise, alias Anenome, cut up
on a surgical platter; about Elizabeth Elliott stabbed to death and too poor to be
re-sleeved; Irene Elliott, weeping for a body that a corporate rep wore on
alternate months; Victor Elliott, whiplashed between loss and retrieval of
someone who was and yet was not the same woman. This was about a young
black man facing his family in a broken-down, middle-aged white body; it was
about Virginia Vidaura walking disdainfully into storage with her head held high
and a last cigarette polluting lungs she was about to lose, no doubt to some other
corporate vampire. It was about Jimmy de Soto, clawing his own eye out in the
mud and fire at Innenin, and the millions like him throughout the Protectorate,
painfully gathered assemblages of individual human potential, pissed away into
the dung-heap of history. For all these, and more, someone was going to pay.
A little dizzily, I climbed down from the forklift and helped Ortega down after
me. It hurt my arms to take her weight, but: nowhere near as much as the
sudden, freezing knowledge that these were our last hours together. I didn't know
where the realisation came from but it came with the solid, settling sensation in
the bedrock of my mind that I had long ago learnt to trust more than rational
thought. We left the re-sleeving chamber hand in hand, neither of us really
noticing the fact until we came face to face with Bautista in the corridor outside
and pulled instinctively apart again.
'Been looking for you, Kovacs.' If Bautista had any feelings about the hand
holding, nothing showed on his face. 'Your mercenary friend skipped and left us
to do the cleaning up.'
'Yeah, Kristi — ' I stopped and nodded sideways at Ortega. 'I've been told. Did
she take the frag gun?'
Bautista nodded.
'So you've got a perfect story. Someone called in gunfire from the Panama Rose,
you came out to look and found the audience massacred, Kadmin and Carnage
dead, me and Ortega halfway there. Must have been someone Carnage upset,
working off a grudge.'
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ortega shake her head.
'Ain't going to scan,' Bautista said. 'All calls into Fell Street get recorded. Same
goes for the phones in the cruisers.'

I shrugged, feeling the Envoy waking within me. 'So what? You, or Ortega,
you've got snitches out here in Richmond. People whose names you can't
disclose. Call came in on a personal phone, which just happened to get smashed
when you had to shoot your way past the remains of Carnage's security guards.
No trace. And nothing on the monitors because the mysterious someone,
whoever did all the shooting, wiped the whole automated security system clean.
That can be arranged, I take it.'
Bautista looked dubious. 'I suppose. We'd need a datarat to do it. Davidson's
good with a deck, but he ain't that good.'
'I can get you a datarat. Anything else?'
'Some of the audience are still alive. Not in any fit state to do anything, but
they're still breathing.'
'Forget them. If they saw anything, it was Trepp. Probably not even that, not
clearly. Whole thing was over in a couple of seconds. The only thing we've got
to decide is when to call the meatwagons.'
'Some time soon,' said Ortega. 'Or it's going to look suspicious.'
Bautista snorted. 'This whole fucking thing looks suspicious. Anyone at Fell
Street's going to know what went down here tonight.'
'Do this sort of thing a lot, do you?'
'That ain't funny, Kovacs. Carnage went over the line, he knew what he was
calling down.'
'Carnage,' Ortega muttered. 'That motherfucker's got himself stored somewhere.
As soon as he gets re-sleeved, he's going to be screaming for an investigation.'
'Maybe not,' said Bautista. 'How long ago you reckon he was copied into that
synth?'
Ortega shrugged. 'Who knows? He was wearing it last week. At least that long,
unless he had the store copy updated. And that's fucking expensive.'
'If I were someone like Carnage,' I said thoughtfully, 'I'd get myself updated

whenever something major went down. No matter what it cost. I wouldn't want
to wake up not knowing what the fuck I'd been doing the week before I got
torched.'
'That depends on what you were doing,' Bautista pointed out. 'If it was some
seriously illegal shit, you might prefer to wake up not knowing about it. That
way, you polygraph your way right out of police interrogation with a smile.'
'Better than that. You wouldn't even . . . '
I trailed off, thinking about it. Bautista made an impatient gesture.
'Whatever. If Carnage wakes up not knowing, he might make some private
enquiries but he ain't going to be in too much of a hurry to let the police
department in on it. And if he wakes up knowing,' he spread his hands, 'he'll
make less noise than a Catholic orgasm. I think we're in the clear here.'
'Get the ambulances, then. And maybe call Murawa in to . . . ' But Ortega's voice
was fading out, as the last part of the puzzle sank snugly into its resting place.
The conversation between the two cops grew as remote as star static over a suit
comlink. I gazed at a tiny dent on the metal wall beside me, hammering at the
idea with every logic test I could muster.
Bautista gave me a curious glance, and left to call the ambulances. As he
disappeared, Ortega touched me lightly on the arm.
'Hey, Kovacs. You OK?'
I blinked.
'Kovacs?'
I put out a hand and touched the wall, as if to assure myself of its solidity.
Compared to the certainty of concept I was experiencing, my surroundings
seemed suddenly intangible.
'Kristin,' I said slowly, 'I have to get aboard Head in the Clouds. I know what
they did to Bancroft. I can bring Kawahara down, and get Resolution 653 pushed
through. And I can spring Ryker.'

Ortega sighed. 'Kovacs, we've been through — '
'No.' The savagery in my voice was so abrupt it even shocked me. I could feel
the bruising in Ryker's face hurt as his features tensed. 'This isn't speculation.
This isn't a cast in the dark. This is fact. And I am going aboard Head in the
Clouds. With or without your help, but I'm going.'
'Kovacs.' Ortega shook her head. 'Look at yourself. You're a mess. Right now
you couldn't take on an Oakland pimp, and you're talking about covert assault on
one of the West Coast Houses. You think you're going to crash Kawahara's
security with broken ribs and that face? Forget it.'
'I didn't say it was going to be easy.'
'Kovacs, it isn't going to be. I sat on the Hendrix tapes long enough for you to
pull that shit with Bancroft, but that's as far as it goes. The game's over, your
friend Sarah gets to go home and so do you. But that's it. I'm not interested in
grudge matches.'
'Do you really want Ryker back?' I asked softly.
For a moment I thought she was going to hit me. Her nostrils flared white and
her right shoulder actually dropped for the punch. I never knew whether it was
the stungun hangover or just self control that stopped her.
'I ought to deck you for that, Kovacs,' she said evenly.
I raised my hands. 'Go ahead, right now I couldn't take on an Oakland pimp.
Remember?'
Ortega made a disgusted sound in her throat and started to turn away. I put out
my hand and touched her.
'Kristin . . . ' I hesitated. 'I'm sorry. That was a bitchy crack, about Ryker. Will
you at least hear me through, once?'
She came back to me, mouth clamped tight over whatever she was feeling, head
down. She swallowed.
'I won't. There's been too much.' She cleared her throat. 'I don't want you hurt

any more, Kovacs. I don't want any more damage, that's all.'
'Damage to Ryker's sleeve, you mean?'
She looked at me.
'No,' she said quietly. 'No, I don't mean that.'
Then she was pressed up against me, there in that grim metal corridor, arms
wrapped hard around me and face buried in my chest, all without apparent
transition. I did some swallowing of my own and held her tightly while the last
of what time we had trickled away like grains of sand through my ringers. And
at that moment I would have given almost anything not to have had a plan for
her to hear, not to have had any way to dissolve what was growing between us,
and not to have hated Reileen Kawahara quite so much.
I would have given almost anything.

Two a.m.
I called Irene Elliott at the JacSol apartment, and got her out of bed. I told her we
had a problem we'd pay heavily to unkink. She nodded sleepily. Bautista went to
get her in an unmarked cruiser.
By the time she arrived, the Panama Rose was lit as if for a deck party. Vertical
searchlights along her sides made it look as if she was being lowered from the
night sky on ropes of luminescence. Illuminum cable incident barriers
crisscrossed the superstructure and the dock moorings. The roof of the cargo cell
where the humiliation bout had gone down was cranked back to allow the
ambulances direct access and the blast of crime scene lighting from within rose
into the night like the glow from a foundry. Police cruisers held the sky and
parked across the dock flashing red and blue.
I met her at the gangway.
'I want my body back,' she shouted over the whine and roar of airborne engines.
The searchlights frosted her sleeve's black hair almost back to blonde.

'I can't swing that for you right now,' I yelled back. 'But it's in the pipeline. First,
you've got to do this. Earn some credit. Now let's get you out of sight before
fucking Sandy Kim spots you.'
Local law were keeping the press copters at bay. Ortega, still sick and shaking,
wrapped herself in a police greatcoat and kept the local law out with the same
glitter-eyed intensity that kept her upright and conscious. Organic Damage
division, shouting, pulling rank, bullying and blurring, held the fort while Elliott
went to work faking in the monitor footage they needed. They were indeed, as
Trepp had recognised, the biggest gang on the block.
'I'm checking out of the apartment tomorrow,' Elliott told me as she worked. 'You
won't be able to reach me there.'
She was silent for a couple of moments, whistling through her teeth at odd
moments as she keyed in the images she had constructed. Then she cast a glance
at me over her shoulder.
'You say I'm earning juice from these guys, doing this. They're going to owe
me?'
'Yeah, I'd say so.'
'Then I'll contact them. Get me the officer in charge, I'll talk to whoever that is.
And don't try to call me at Ember, I won't be there either.'
I said nothing, just looked at her. She turned back to her work.
'I need some time alone,' she muttered.
Just the words sounded like a luxury to me.

CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT

I watched him pour a drink from the bottle of fifteen-year-old malt, take it to the
phone and seat himself carefully. The broken ribs had been welded back together
in one of the ambulances, but the whole of that side was still one huge ache, with
occasional, flinty stabs of agony. He sipped at the whisky, gathered himself
visibly and punched out the call.
'Bancroft residence. With whom do you wish to speak?' It was the severelysuited woman who had answered last time I called Suntouch House. The same
suit, the same hair, even the same make-up. Maybe she was a phone construct.
'Miriam Bancroft,' he said.
Once again, it was the sensation of being a passive observer, the same sensation
of disconnection that I had felt that night in front of the mirror while Ryker's
sleeve put on its weapons. The frags. Only this time it was much worse.
'One moment, please.'
The woman disappeared from the screen and was replaced by the image of a
windblown match flame in synch with piano music that sounded like autumn
leaves being blown along a cracked and worn pavement. A minute passed, then
Miriam Bancroft appeared, immaculately attired in a formal-looking jacket and
blouse. She raised one perfectly groomed eyebrow.
'Mr Kovacs. This is a surprise.'

'Yeah, well.' He gestured uncomfortably. Even across the comlink, Miriam
Bancroft radiated a sensuality that unbalanced him. 'Is this a secure line?'
'Reasonably so, yes. What do you want?'
He cleared his throat. 'I've been thinking. There are some things I'd like to
discuss with you. I, uh, I may owe you an apology.'
'Indeed?' This time it was both eyebrows. 'When exactly did you have in mind?'
He shrugged. 'I'm not doing anything right now.'
'Yes. I, however, am doing something right now, Mr Kovacs. I am en route to a
meeting in Chicago and will not be back on the coast until tomorrow evening.'
The faintest hint of a smile twitched at the corners of her mouth. 'Will you wait?'
'Sure.'
She leaned towards the screen, eyes narrowing. 'What happened to your face?'
He raised a hand to one of the emerging facial bruises. In the low light of the
room, he had not expected it to be so noticeable. Nor had he expected Miriam
Bancroft to be so attentive.
'Long story. Tell you when I see you.'
'Well, that I can hardly resist,' she said ironically. 'I shall send a limousine to
collect you from the Hendrix tomorrow afternoon. Shall we say about four
o'clock? Good. Until then.'
The screen cleared. He sat, staring at it for a moment, then switched off the
phone and swivelled the chair round to face the window shelf.
'She makes me nervous,' he said.
'Yeah, me too. Well, obviously.'
'Very funny.'
'I try.'

I got up to fetch the whisky bottle. As I crossed the room, I caught my reflection
in the mirror beside the bed.
Where Ryker's sleeve had the air of a man who had battered his way head first
through life's trials, the man in the mirror looked as if he would be able to slip
neatly aside at every crisis and watch fate fall clumsily on its fat face. The body
was cat-like in its movements, a smooth and effortless economy of motion that
would have looked good on Anchana Salomao. The thick, almost blue-black hair
fell in a soft cascade to the deceptively slim shoulders, and the elegantly tilted
eyes had a gentle, unconcerned expression that suggested the universe was a
good place to live in.
I had only been in the tech ninja sleeve a few hours — seven, and forty-two
minutes according to the time display chipped into my upper left field of vision
— but there were none of the usual download side effects. I collected the whisky
bottle with one of the slim brown artist's hands and the simple play of muscle
and bone was a joy that glowed through me. The Khumalo neurachem system
thrummed continually at the limit of perception, as if it were singing faintly the
myriad possible things the body could do at any given moment. Never, even
during my time with the Envoy Corps, had I worn anything like it.
I remembered Carnage's words and mentally shook my head. If the UN thought
they'd be able to impose a ten-year colonial embargo on this, they were living in
another world.
'I don't know about you,' he said, 'but this feels fucking weird.'
'Tell me about it.' I filled my own tumbler and proffered the bottle. He shook his
head. I went back to the window shelf and sat back against the glass.
'How the fuck did Kadmin stand it? Ortega says he used to work with himself all
the time.'
'Get used to anything in time, I suppose. Besides, Kadmin was fucking crazy.'
'Oh, and we're not?'
I shrugged. 'We didn't have a choice. Apart from walking away, I mean. Would
that have been better?'

'You tell me. You're the one who's going up against Kawahara. I'm just the whore
around here. Incidentally, I don't reckon Ortega's exactly overjoyed about that
part of the deal. I mean, she was confused before, but now — '
'She's confused! How do you think I feel?'
'I know how you feel, idiot. I am you.'
'Are you?' I sipped at my drink and gestured with the glass. 'How long do you
think it takes before we stop being exactly the same person?'
He shrugged. 'You are what you remember. Right now we only have about seven
or eight hours of separate perceptions. Can't have made much of a dent yet, can
it?'
'On forty-odd years of memory? I suppose not. And it's the early stuff that builds
personality.'
'Yeah, they say. And while we're on the subject, tell me something. How do you
feel, I mean how do we feel about the Patchwork Man being dead?'
I shifted uncomfortably. 'Do we need to talk about this?'
'We need to talk about something. We're stuck here with each other until
tomorrow evening — '
'You can go out, if you want. Come to that,' I jerked a thumb upward towards the
roof, 'I can get out of here the way I came in.'
'You really don't want to talk about it that badly, huh?'
'Wasn't that tough.'
That, at least, was true. The original draft of the plan had called for the ninja
copy of me to stay at Ortega's apartment until the Ryker copy had disappeared
with Miriam Bancroft. Then it occurred to me that we'd need a working
relationship with the Hendrix to bring off the assault on Head in the Clouds, and
that there was no way for the ninja copy of myself to prove its identity to the
hotel, short of submission to a storage scan. It seemed a better idea for the Ryker
copy to introduce the ninja before departing with Miriam Bancroft. Since the

Ryker copy was undoubtedly still under surveillance, at the very least, by Trepp,
walking in through the front door of the Hendrix together looked like a very bad
idea. I borrowed a grav harness and a stealth suit from Bautista, and just before it
started to get light I skimmed in between the patchy high-level traffic and down
onto a sheltered flange on the forty-second floor. The Hendrix had by this time
been advised of my arrival by the Ryker copy and let me in through a ventilation
duct.
With the Khumalo neurachem, it had been almost as easy as walking in through
the front door.
'Look,' the Ryker copy said. 'I'm you. I know everything you know. What's the
harm in talking about this stuff?'
'If you know everything I know, what's the point of talking about it?'
'Sometimes, it helps to externalise things. Even if you talk to someone else about
it, you're usually talking to yourself. The other guy's just providing a sounding
board. You talk it out.'
I sighed. 'I don't know. I buried all that shit about Dad a long time ago, it's a long
time dead.'
'Yeah, right.'
'I'm serious.'
'No.' He flicked a finger at me the way I had pointed at Bancroft when he didn't
want to face my facts on the balcony of Suntouch House. 'You're lying to
yourself. Remember that pimp we met in Lazlo's pipe house the year we joined
Shonagon's Eleven. The one we nearly killed before they pulled us off him.'
'That was just chemicals. We were off our head on tetrameth, showing off
because of the Eleven stuff. Fuck, we were only sixteen.'
'Bullshit. We did it because he looked like Dad.'
'Maybe.'
'Fact. And we spent the next decade and a half killing authority figures for the

same reason.'
'Oh, give me a fucking break! We spent that decade and a half killing anyone
who got in the way. It was the military, that's what we did for a living. And,
anyway, since when is a pimp an authority figure?'
'OK, maybe it was pimps we spent fifteen years killing. Users. Maybe that's
what we were paying back.'
'He never pimped Mum out.'
'Are you sure? Why were we so hot to hit the Elizabeth Elliott angle like a
fucking tactical nuke? Why the accent on whorehouses in this investigation?'
'Because,' I said, sinking a finger of whisky, 'that is what this investigation has
been about from the beginning. We went after the Elliott angle because it felt
right. Envoy intuition. The way Bancroft treated his wife — '
'Oh, Miriam Bancroft. Now there's another whole disc we could spin.'
'Shut up. Elliott was a pretty fucking good sounding shot. We wouldn't have got
to Head in the Clouds without that trip to Jerry's biocabins.'
'Ahhh.' He made a disgusted gesture and tipped his own glass back. 'You believe
what you want. I say the Patchwork Man's been a metaphor for Dad because we
couldn't bear to look too closely at the truth and that's why we freaked the first
time we saw a composite construct in virtual. Remember that, do you? That rec
house on Adoracion. We had rage dreams for a week after that little show.
Waking up with shreds of pillow on your hands. They sent us to the psychs for
that.'
I gestured irritably. 'Yeah, I remember. I remember being shit scared of the
Patchwork Man, not Dad. I remember feeling the same when we met Kadmin in
virtual too.'
'And now he's dead? How do we feel now?'
'I don't feel anything.'
He pointed at me again. 'That's a cover.'

'It is not a cover. The motherfucker got in my way, he threatened me and now
he's dead. Transmission ends.'
'Remember anyone else threatening you, do you? When you were small, maybe?'
'I am not going to talk about this any more.' I reached for the bottle and filled my
glass again. 'Pick another subject. What about Ortega? What are our feelings on
that score?'
'Are you planning to drink that whole bottle?'
'You want some?'
'No.'
I spread my hands. 'So what's it to you?'
'Are you trying to get drunk?'
'Of course I am. If I've got to talk to myself, I don't see why I should do it sober.
So tell me about Ortega.'
'I don't want to talk about that.'
'Why not?' I asked reasonably. 'Got to talk about something, remember. What's
wrong with Ortega?'
'What's wrong is that we don't feel the same about her. You aren't wearing
Ryker's sleeve any more.'
'That doesn't — '
'Yes, it does. What's between us and Ortega is completely physical. There hasn't
been time for anything else. That's why you're so happy to talk about her now. In
that sleeve, all you've got is some vague nostalgia about that yacht and a bundle
of snapshot memories to back it up. There's nothing chemical happening to you
any more.'
I reached for something to say, and abruptly found nothing. The suddenly
discovered difference sat between us like a third, unwanted occupant of the

room.
The Ryker copy dug into his pockets and came up with Ortega's cigarettes. The
packet was crushed almost flat. He extracted a cigarette, looked ruefully at it and
fitted it into his mouth. I tried not to look disapproving.
'Last one,' he said, touching the ignition patch to it.
'The hotel probably has more.'
'Yeah.' He plumed out smoke, and I found myself almost envying him the
addiction. 'You know, there is one thing we should be discussing right now.'
'What's that?'
But I knew already. We both knew.
'You want me to spell it out? All right.' He drew on the cigarette again and
shrugged, not easily. 'We have to decide which of us gets obliterated when this is
all over. And since our individual instinct for survival is getting stronger by the
minute, we need to decide soon.'
'How?'
'I don't know. Which would you prefer to remember? Taking down Kawahara?
Or going down on Miriam Bancroft?' He smiled sourly. 'No competition, I
suppose.'
'Hey, this isn't just a roll on the beach you're talking about. This is multiple copy
sex. It's about the only genuinely illicit pleasure left. Anyway, Irene Elliott said
we could do a memory graft and keep both sets of experience.'
'Probably. She said we could probably do a memory graft. And that still leaves
one of us to be cancelled out. It's not a meld, it's a graft, from one of us to the
other. Editing. You want to do that to yourself? To the one that survives. We
couldn't even face editing that construct the Hendrix built. How are we going to
live with this? No way, it's got to be a clean cut. One or the other. And we've got
to decide which.'
'Yeah.' I picked up the whisky bottle and stared gloomily at the label. 'So what

do we do? Gamble for it? Paper, scissors, stone, say the best of five?'
'I was thinking along slightly more rational lines. We tell each other our
memories from this point on and then decide which we want to keep. Which
ones are worth more.'
'How the hell are we going to measure something like that?'
'We'll know. You know we will.'
'What if one of us lies. Embroiders the truth to make it sound like a more
appealing memory. Or lies about which one they like better.'
His eyes narrowed. 'Are you serious?'
'A lot can happen in a few days. Like you said, we're both going to want to
survive.'
'Ortega can polygraph us if it comes to that.'
'I think I'd rather gamble.'
'Give me that fucking bottle. If you're not going to take this seriously, nor am I.
Fuck it, you might even get torched out there and solve the problem for us.'
'Thanks.'
I passed him the bottle and watched as he decanted two careful fingers. Jimmy
de Soto had always said it was sacrilege to sink more than five fingers of single
malt on any one occasion. After that, he maintained, you might as well be
drinking blended. I had a feeling that we were going to profane that particular
article of faith tonight.
I raised my glass.
'To unity of purpose.'
'Yeah, and an end to drinking alone.'

The hangover was still with me nearly a full day later as I watched him leave on
one of the hotel monitors. He stepped out onto the pavement and waited while
the long, polished limousine settled to the kerb. As the kerbside door hinged up,
I caught a brief glimpse of Miriam Bancroft's profile within. Then he was
climbing in and the door swung smoothly back down to cover them both. The
limousine trembled along its length and lifted away.
I dry-swallowed more painkillers, gave it ten minutes and then went up to the
roof to wait for Ortega.
It was cold.

CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

Ortega had a variety of news.
Irene Elliott had called in a location and said she was willing to talk about
another run. The call had come in on one of the tightest needlecasts Fell Street
had ever seen and Elliott said she would only deal directly with me.
Meanwhile, the Panama Rose patch-up was holding water, and Ortega still had
the Hendrix memory tapes. Kadmin's death had rendered Fell Street's original
case pretty much an administrative formality, and no one was in any hurry to
tackle it any more. An Internal Affairs inquiry into how exactly the assassin had
been pulled out of holding in the first place was just getting started. In view of
the assumed AI involvement, the Hendrix would come under scrutiny at some
point, but it wasn't in the pipeline yet. There were some interdepartmental
procedures to be gone through and Ortega had sold Murawa a story about loose
ends. The Fell Street captain gave her a couple of weeks open-ended, to tidy up;
the tacit assumption was that Ortega had no liking for Internal Affairs and wasn't
going to make life easy for them.
A couple of IA detectives were sniffing around the Panama Rose, but Organic
Damage had closed ranks around Ortega and Bautista like a stack shutdown. IA
were getting nothing so far.
We had a couple of weeks.

Ortega flew north-east. Elliott's instructions vectored us in on a small huddle of
bubblefabs clustered around the western end of a tree-fringed lake hundreds of
kilometres from anywhere. Ortega grunted in recognition as we banked above
the encampment.
'You know this place?'
'Places like it. Grifter town. See that dish in the centre? They've got: it webbed
into some old geosynch weather platform, gives them free access to anything in
the hemisphere. This place probably accounts for a single figure percentage of
all the data crime on the West Coast.'
'They never get busted?'
'Depends.' Ortega put the cruiser down on the lake shore a short distance from
the nearest bubblefabs. 'The way it stands, these people keep the old orbitals
ticking over. Without them, someone'd have to pay for decommissioning and
that's kind of pricey. So long as the stuff they turn over is small-scale, no one
bothers. Transmission Felony Division have got bigger discs to spin, and no one
else is interested. You coming?'
I climbed out and we walked along the shoreline to the encampment. From the
air, the place had had a certain structural uniformity, but now I could see that the
bubblefabs were all painted with brightly coloured pictures or abstract patterns.
No two designs were alike, although I could discern the same artistic hand at
work in several of the examples we passed. In addition, a lot of the 'fabs were
fitted out with porch canopies, secondary extension bulges and in some cases
even more permanent log cabin annexes. Clothing hung on lines between the
buildings and small children ran about, getting cheerfully filthy.
Camp security met us inside the first ring of 'fabs. He stood over two metres tall
in flat workboots and probably weighed as much as both my current selves put
together. Beneath loose grey coveralls, I could see the stance of a fighter. His
eyes were a startling red and short horns sprouted from his temples. Beneath the
horns, his face was scarred and old. The effect was startlingly offset by the small
child he was cradling in his left arm.
He nodded at me.

'You Anderson?'
'Yes. This is Kristin Ortega.' I was surprised how flat the name suddenly sounded
to me. Without Ryker's pheromonal interface, I was left with little more than a
vague appreciation that the woman beside me was very attractive in a lean, selfsufficient way that recalled Virginia Vidaura.
That, and my memories.
I wondered if she was feeling the same.
'Cop, huh?' The ex-freak fighter's tone was not overflowing with warmth, but it
didn't sound too hostile either.
'Not at the moment,' I said firmly. 'Is Irene here?'
'Yeah.' He shifted the child to his other arm and pointed. 'The 'fab with the stars
on it. Been expecting you.'
As he spoke, Irene Elliott emerged from the structure in question. The horned
man grunted and led us across, picking up a small train of additional children on
the way. Elliott watched us approach with her hands in her pockets. Like the exfighter, she was dressed in boots and coveralls whose grey was startlingly offset
by a violently-coloured rainbow headband.
'Your visitors,' said the horned man. 'You OK with this?'
Elliott nodded evenly, and he hesitated a moment longer, then shrugged and
wandered off with the children in tow. Elliott watched him go, then turned back
to us.
'You'd better come inside,' she said.
Inside the bubblefab, the utilitarian space had been sectioned off with wooden
partitions and woven rugs hung from wires set in the plastic dome. Walls were
covered in more artwork, most of which looked as if it had been contributed by
the children of the camp. Elliott took us to a softly lit space set with lounging
bags and a battered-looking access terminal on a hinged arm epoxied to the wall
of the bubble. She seemed to have adjusted well to the sleeve, and her
movements were smoothly unselfconscious. I'd noticed the improvement on

board the Panama Rose in the early hours of the morning, but here it was clearer.
She lowered herself easily into one of the loungers and looked speculatively up
at me.
'That's you inside there, Anderson, I presume?'
I inclined my head.
'You going to tell me why?'
I seated myself opposite her. 'That depends on you, Irene. Are you in or out?'
'You guarantee I get my own body back.' She was trying hard to sound casual,
but there was no disguising the hunger in her voice. 'That's the deal?'
I glanced up at Ortega, who nodded. 'That's correct. If this comes off
successfully, we'll be able to requisition it under a federal mandate. But it has to
be successful. If we fuck up, we'll probably all go down the double barrel.'
'You are operating under a federal brief, lieutenant?'
Ortega smiled tightly. 'Not exactly. But under the UN charter, we'll be able to
apply the brief retrospectively. If, as I said, we are successful.'
'A retrospective federal brief.' Elliott looked back to me, brows raised. 'That's
about as common as whalemeat. This must be something gigantic.'
'It is,' I said.
Elliott's eyes narrowed. 'And you're not with JacSol any more, are you? Who the
fuck are you, Anderson?'
'I'm your fairy godmother, Elliott. Because if the lieutenant's requisition doesn't
work out, I'll buy your sleeve back. That's a guarantee. Now are you in, or are
you out?'
Irene Elliott hung on to her detachment: for a moment longer, a moment in
which I felt my technical respect for her take on a more personal tone. Then she
nodded.

'Tell me,' she said.
I told her.
It took about half an hour to lay it out, while Ortega stood about or paced
restlessly in and out of the bubblefab. I couldn't blame her. Over the past ten
days she'd had to face the breakdown of practically every professional tenet she
owned, and she was now committed to a project that, if it went wrong, offered a
bristling array of hundred-year or better storage offences for all concerned. I
think, without Bautista and the others behind her, she might not have risked it,
even with her cordial hatred of the Meths, even for Ryker.
Or maybe I just tell myself that.
Irene Elliott sat and listened in silence broken only by three technical queries to
which I had no answers. When I was finished, she said nothing for a long time.
Ortega stopped her pacing and came to stand behind me, waiting.
'You're insane,' said Elliott finally.
'Can you do it?'
She opened her mouth, then shut it again. Her face went dreamy, and I guessed
she was reviewing a previous Dipping episode from memory. After a few
moments she snapped back and nodded as if she might be trying to convince
herself.
'Yes,' she said slowly. 'It can be done, but not in real time. This isn't like
rewriting your fightdrome friends' security system, or even downloading into
that AI core. This makes what we did to the AI look like a systems check. To do
this, to even attempt this, I've got to have a virtual forum.'
'That's not a problem. Anything else?'
'That depends on what counter-intrusion systems Head in the Clouds is running.'
Disgust, and an edge of tears coloured her tone for a couple of instants. 'You say
this is a high-class whorehouse?'
'Very,' said Ortega.

Elliott's feelings went back underground. 'Then I'll have to run some checks.
That'll take time.'
'How much time?' Ortega wanted to know.
'Well, I can do it two ways.' Professional scorn surfaced in her voice, scarring
over the emotion that had been there before. 'I can do a fast scan and maybe ring
every alarm aboard this prick in the sky. Or I can do it right, which'll take a
couple of days. Your choice. We're running on your clock.'
'Take your time,' I suggested, with a warning glance at Ortega. 'Now what about
wiring me for sight and sound. You know anyone who can do that discreetly?'
'Yeah, we got people here can do that. But you can forget a telemetry system.
You try and transmit out of there, you will bring the house down. No pun
intended.' She moved to the arm-mounted terminal and punched up a general
access screen. 'I'll see if Reese can dig you up a grab-and-stash mike. Shielded
microstack, you'll be able to record a couple of hundred hours high res and we
can retrieve it here later.'
'Good enough. This going to be expensive?'
Elliott turned back to us, eyebrows hoisted. 'Talk to Reese. She'll probably have
to buy the parts in, but maybe you can get her to do the surgery on a
retrospective federal basis. She could use the juice at UN level.'
I glanced at Ortega, who shrugged exasperatedly.
'I guess,' she said ungraciously, as Elliott busied herself with the screen. I stood
up and turned to the policewoman.
'Ortega,' I muttered into her ear, abruptly aware that in the new sleeve I was
completely unmoved by her scent. 'It isn't my fault we're short of funds. The
JacSol account's gone, evaporated, and if I start drawing on .Bancroft's credit for
stuff like this, it's going to look fucking odd. Now get a grip.'
'It isn't that,' she hissed back.
'Then what is it?'

She looked at me, at our brutally casual proximity. 'You know goddamn well
what it is.'
I drew a deep breath and closed my eyes to avoid having to meet her gaze. 'Did
you sort out that hardware for me?'
'Yeah.' She stepped back, voice returning to normal volume and empty of tone.
'The stungun from the Fell Street tackle room, no one'll miss it. The rest is
coming out of NYPD confiscated weapon stocks. I'm flying out to pick it up
tomorrow personally. Material transaction, no records. I called in a couple of
favours.'
'Good. Thanks.'
'Don't mention it,' Her tone was savagely ironic. 'Oh, by the way, they had a hell
of a time getting hold of the spider venom load. I don't suppose you'd care to tell
me what that's all about, would you?'
'It's a personal thing.'
Elliott got someone on the screen. A serious-looking woman in a late fifties
African sleeve.
'Hey, Reese,' she said cheerfully. 'Got a customer for you.'

Despite the pessimistic estimate, Irene Elliott finished her preliminary scan a day
later. I was down by the lake, recovering from Reese's simple microsurgery and
skimming stones with a girl of about six who seemed to have adopted me.
Ortega was still in New York, the chill between us not really resolved.
Elliott emerged from the encampment and yelled out the news of her successful
covert scan without bothering to come down to the water's edge. I winced as the
echoes floated out across the water. The open atmosphere of the little settlement
took some getting used to, and how it fitted in with successful data piracy I still
couldn't see. I handed my stone to the girl and rubbed reflexively at the tiny
soreness under one eye where Reese had gone in and implanted the recording
system.

'Here. See if you can do it with this one.'
'Your stones are heavy' she said plaintively.
'Well, try anyway. I got nine skips out of the last one.' She squinted up at me.
'You're wired for it. I'm only six.'
'True. On both counts.' I placed a hand on her head. 'But you've got to work with
what you've got.'
'When I'm big I'm going to be wired like Auntie Reese.'
I felt a small sadness well up on the cleanly swept floor of my Khumalo
neurachem brain. 'Good for you. Look, I've got to go. Don't go too close to the
water, right?'
She looked at me exasperatedly. 'I can swim.'
'So can I, but it looks cold, don't you think?'
'Ye-e-es . . . '
'There you are then.' I ruffled her hair and set off up the beach. At the first
bubblefab I looked back. She was hefting the big flat stone at the lake as if the
water were an enemy.
Elliott was in the expansive, post-mission mood that most datarats seem to hit
after a long spell cruising the stacks.
'I've been doing a little historical digging,' she said, swinging the terminal arm
outward from its resting place. Her hands danced across the terminal deck and
the screen flared into life, shedding colours on her face. 'How's the implant?'
I touched my lower eyelid again. 'Fine. Tapped straight into the same system that
runs the timechip. Reese could have made a living doing this.'
'She used to,' said Elliott shortly. 'Till they busted her for anti-Protectorate
literature. When this is all over, you make sure that someone puts in a word for
her at federal level, because she sure as shit needs it.'

'Yeah, she said.' I peered over her shoulder at the screen. 'What have you got
there?'
'Head in the Clouds. Tampa aeroyard blueprints. Hull specs, the works. This
stuff is centuries old. I'm amazed they still keep it on stack at all. Anyway, seems
she was originally commissioned as part of the Caribbean storm management
flotilla, back before SkySysterns orbital weather net put them all out of business.
A lot of the long-range scanning equipment got ripped out when they refitted,
but they left the local sensors in and that's what provides basic skin security.
Temperature pick-ups, infrared, that sort of thing. Anything with body heat lands
anywhere on the hull, they'll know it's there.'
I nodded, unsurprised. 'Ways in?'
She shrugged. 'Hundreds. Ventilation ducts, maintenance crawlways. Take your
pick.'
'I'll need to have another look at what Miller told my construct. But assume I'm
going in from the top. Body heat's the only real problem?'
'Yeah, but those sensors are looking for anything over a square millimetre of
temperature differential. A stealth suit won't cover you. Christ, even the breath
coming out of your lungs will probably trip them. And it doesn't stop there.'
Elliott nodded sombrely at the screen. 'They must have liked the system a lot,
because when they refitted they ran it through the whole ship. Room temperature
monitors on every corridor and walkway.'
'Yeah, Miller said something about a heat signature tag.'
'That's it. Incoming guests get it on boarding and their codes are incorporated
into the system. Anyone else walks down a corridor uninvited, or goes
somewhere their tag says they can't, they set off every alarm in the hull. Simple,
and very effective. And I don't think I can cut in there and write you a welcome
code. Too much security.'
'Don't worry about it,' I said. 'I don't think it's going to be a problem.'

'You what?' Ortega looked at me with fury and disbelief spreading across her

face like a storm front. She stood away from me as if I might be contagious
'It was just a suggestion. If you don't — '
'No.' She said the word as if it was new to her and she liked the taste. 'No. No
fucking way. I've connived at viral crime for you, I've hidden evidence for you,
I've assisted you in multiple sleeving — '
'Hardly multiple.'
'It's a fucking crime,' she said through her teeth. 'I am not going to steal
confiscated drugs out of police holding for you.'
'OK, forget it.' I hesitated, put my tongue in my cheek for a moment. 'Want to
help me confiscate some more, then?'
Something inside me cheered as the unwilling smile broke cover on her face.

The dealer was in the same place he had been when I walked into his 'cast radius
two weeks ago. This time I saw him twenty metres away, skulking in an alcove
with the bat-eyed broadcast unit on his shoulder like a familiar. There were very
few people on the street in any direction. I nodded to Ortega who was stationed
across the street and walked on. The sales 'cast had not changed, the street of
ridiculously ferocious women and the sudden cool of the betathanatine hit, but
this time I was expecting it and in any case the Khumalo neurachem had a
definite damping effect on the intrusion. I stepped up to the dealer with an eager
smile.
'Got Stiff, man.'
'Good, that's what I'm looking for. How much have you got?'
He started a little, expression coiling between greed and suspicion. His hand
slipped down towards the horrorbox at his belt just in case.
'How much you want, man?'
'All of it,' I said cheerfully. 'Everything you've got.'

He read me, but by then it was too late. I had the lock on two of his fingers as
they stabbed at the horrorbox controls.
'Ah-ah.'
He took a swipe at me with the other arm. I broke the fingers. He howled and
collapsed around the pain. I lacked him in the stomach and took the horrorbox
away from him. Behind me, Ortega arrived and flashed her badge in his sweatbeaded face.
'Bay City police,' she said laconically. 'You're busted. Let's see what you've got,
shall we.'
The betathanatine was in a series of dermal pads with tiny glass decanters folded
in cotton. I held one of the vials up to the light and shook it. The liquid within
was a pale red.
'What do you reckon?' I asked Ortega. 'About eight per cent?'
'Looks like. Maybe less.' Ortega put a knee into the dealer's neck, grinding his
face into the pavement. 'Where do you cut this stuff, pal?'
'This is good merchandise,' the dealer squealed. 'I buy direct. This is — '
Ortega rapped hard on his skull with her knuckles and he shut up.
'This is shit,' she said patiently. 'This has been stepped on so hard it wouldn't give
you a cold. We don't want it. So you can have your whole stash back and walk, if
you like. All we want to know is where you cut it. An address.'
'I don't know any — '
'Do you want to be shot while escaping?' Ortega asked him pleasantly, and he
grew suddenly very quiet.
'Place in Oakland,' he said sullenly.
Ortega gave him a pencil and paper. 'Write it down. No names, just the address.
And so help me, if you're tinselling me I'll come back here with fifty ccs of real
Stiff and feed you the lot, unstepped.'

She took back the scrawled paper and glanced at it, removed her knee from the
dealer's neck and patted him on the shoulder.
'Good. Now get up and get the fuck off the street. You can go back to work
tomorrow, if this is the right place. And if it's not, remember, I know your patch.'
We watched him lurch off and Ortega tapped the paper.
'I know this place. Controlled Substances busted them a couple of times last
year, but some slick lawyer gets the important guys off every time. We'll make a
lot of noise, let them think they're buying us off with a bag of uncut.'
'Fair enough.' I looked after the retreating figure of the dealer. 'Would you really
have shot him?'
'Nah.' Ortega grinned. 'But he doesn't know that. ConSub do it sometimes, just to
get major dealers off the street when there's something big going down. Official
reprimand for the officer involved and compensation pays out for a new sleeve,
but it takes time, and the scumbag does that time in the store. Plus it hurts to get
shot. I was convincing, huh?'
'Convinced the fuck out of me.'
'Maybe I should have been an Envoy.'
I shook my head. 'Maybe you should spend less time around me.'

I stared up at the ceiling, waiting for the hypnophone sonocodes to lull me away
from reality. On either side of me, Davidson, the Organic Damage datarat, and
Ortega had settled into their racks and even through the hypnophones I could
hear their breathing, slow and regular, at the limits of my neurachem perception.
I tried to relax more, to let the hypnosystem press me down through levels of
softly decreasing consciousness, but instead my mind was whirring through the
details of the set-up like a program check scanning for error. It was like the
insomnia I'd suffered after Innenin, an infuriating synaptic itch that refused to go
away. When my peripheral vision time display told me that at least a full minute
had gone by, I propped myself up on one elbow and looked around at the figures
dreaming in the other racks.

'Is there a problem?' I asked loudly.
'The tracking of Sheryl Bostock is complete,' said the hotel. 'I assumed you
would prefer to be alone when I informed you.'
I sat upright and started picking the trodes off my body. 'You assumed right. You
sure everyone else is under?'
'Lieutenant Ortega and her colleagues were installed in the virtuality
approximately two minutes ago. Irene Elliott has been established there since
earlier this afternoon. She asked not to be disturbed.'
'What ratio are you running at the moment?' 'Eleven point fifteen. Irene Elliott
requested it.' I nodded to myself as I climbed out of the rack. Eleven point one
five was a standard working ratio for datarats. It was also the title of a
particularly bloody but otherwise unmemorable Micky Nozawa experia flic. The
only clear detail I could recall was that, unexpectedly, Micky's character got
killed at the end. I hoped it wasn't an omen.
'All right,' I said. 'Let's see what you've got.'

Between the dimly seen heave and swell of the sea and the lights of the cabin,
there was a lemon grove. I went along a dirt track between the trees and the
citrus fragrance felt like cleansing. From the long grass on either side, cicadas
whirred reassuringly. In a velvet sky above were stars like fixed gems and
behind the cabin the land rose into gentle hills and rocky outcroppings. The
vague white forms of sheep moved in the darkness on the slopes, and from
somewhere I heard a dog bark. The lights of a fishing village glimmered off to
one side, less bright than the stars.
There were hurricane lamps slung from the upper rail of the cabin's front porch,
but no one was seated at the wooden tables there. The front wall bore a riotous
abstract mural curling around and out from the luminous lettering of a sign that
read Pension Flower of '68. Windchimes dangled along the railing, winking and
turning in the faint breeze that blew in from the sea. They made a variety of
gentle sounds from glassy belling to hollow wooden percussion.
On the unkempt sloping lawn in front of the porch someone had set out an

incongruous collection of sofas and armchairs in a rough circle, so it looked as if
the cabin had been lifted bodily off its furnished interior and set down again
further up the slope. From the gathered seats came the soft sound of voices and
the red embers of lit cigarettes. I reached for my own supply, realised I had
neither the packet nor the need any more and grimaced wryly to myself in the
dark.
Bautista's voice rose above the murmur of conversation.
'Kovacs? That you?'
'Who else is it going to be?' I heard Ortega ask him impatiently. 'This is a
goddamn virtuality.'
'Yeah, but . . . ' Bautista shrugged and gestured to the empty seats. 'Welcome to
the party.'
There were five figures seated in the circle of lounge furniture. Irene Elliott and
Davidson were seated at opposite ends of a sofa beside Bautista's chair. On the
other side of Bautista, Ortega had sprawled her long-limbed body along the full
length of a second sofa.
The fifth figure was relaxed deep into another armchair, legs stretched out in
front of him, face sunk in shadows. Wiry black hair stuck up in silhouette above
a multicoloured bandanna. Lying across his lap was a white guitar. I stopped in
front of him.
'The Hendrix, right?'
'That's correct.' There was a depth and timbre to the voice that had been absent
before. The big hands moved across frets and dislodged a tumble of chords onto
the darkened lawn. 'Base entity projection. Hardwired in by the original
designers. If you strip down the client-mirroring systems, this is what you get.'
'Good.' I took an armchair opposite Irene Elliott. 'You happy with the working
environment?'
She nodded. 'Yeah, it's fine.'
'How long've you been here?'

'Me?' She shrugged. 'A day or so. Your friends got here a couple of hours ago.'
'Two and a half,' said Ortega sourly. 'What kept you?'
'Neurachem glitch.' I nodded at the Hendrix figure. 'Didn't he tell you?'
'That's exactly what he told us.' Ortega's gaze was wholly cop. 'I'd just like to
know what it means.'
I made a helpless gesture. 'So would I. The Khumalo system kept kicking me out
of the pipe, and it took us a while to get compatibility. Maybe I'll mail the
manufacturers.' I turned back to Irene Elliott. 'I take it you're going to want the
format run up to maximum for the Dip.'
'You take it right.' Elliott jerked her thumb at the Hendrix figure. 'Man says the
place runs to three twenty-three max, and we are going to need every scrap of
that to pull it off.'
'You cased the run yet?'
Elliott nodded glumly. 'It's locked up tighter than an orbital bank. But I can tell
you a couple of interesting things. One, your friend Sarah Sachilowska was
freighted off Head in the Clouds two days ago, relayed off the Gateway comsat
out to Harlan's World. So she's out of the firing line.'
'I'm impressed. How long did it take you to dig that up.'
'A while.' Elliott inclined her head in the Hendrix's direction. 'I had some help.'
'And the second interesting thing?'
'Yeah. Covert needlecast to a receiver in Europe every eighteen hours. Can't tell
you much more than that without Dipping it, and I figured you wouldn't want
that just yet. But it looks like what we're after.'
I remembered the spider-like automatic guns and leathery impact-resistant womb
sacs, the sombre stone guardians that supported the roof of Kawahara's basilica,
and I found myself once more smiling in response to those contemptuous hooded
smiles.

'Well, then.' I looked around at the assembled team. 'Let's get this gig off the
ground.'

CHAPTER FORTY

It was Sharya, all over again.
We dusted off from the tower of the Hendrix an hour after dark and swung away
into the traffic-speckled night. Ortega had pulled the same Lock-Mit transport I'd
ridden out to Suntouch House, but when I looked around the dimly lit interior of
the ship's belly, it was the Envoy Command attack on Zihicce that I remembered.
The scene was the same; Davidson playing the role of datacom officer, face
washed pale blue by the light from his screen; Ortega as medic, unpacking the
dermals and charging kit from a sealwrap bag. Up ahead in the hatchway to the
cockpit, Bautista stood and looked worried, while another mohican I didn't know
did the flying. Something must have shown on my face, because Ortega leaned
in abruptly to study my face.
'Problem?'
I shook my head. 'Just a little nostalgia.'
'Well, I just hope you got these measures right.' She braced herself against the
hull. In her hand, the first dermal looked like a petal torn from some iridescent
green plant. I grinned up at her and rolled my head to one side to expose my
jugular.
'This is the fourteen per cent,' she said and applied the cool green petal to my
neck. I felt the fractional grip, like gentle sandpaper, as it took, and then a long
cold finger leapt down past my collar bone and deep into my chest.

'Smooth.'
'Fucking ought to be. You know how much that stuff would go for on the street?'
'The perks of law enforcement, huh?'
Bautista turned round. 'That ain't funny, Kovacs.'
'Leave him alone, Rod,' said Ortega lazily. 'Man's entitled to a bad joke, under
the circumstances. It's just nerves.'
I raised one finger to my temple in acknowledgment of the point. Ortega peeled
back the dermal gingerly and stood back.
'Three minutes till the next,' she said. 'Right?'
I nodded complacently and opened my mind to the effects of the Reaper.
At first it was uncomfortable. As my body temperature started to fall, the air in
the transport grew hot and oppressive. It sank humidly into my lungs and lay
there, so that every breath became an effort. My vision smeared and my mouth
turned uncomfortably dry as the fluid balance of my body seesawed. Movement,
however small, began to seem like an imposition. Thought itself turned
ponderous with effort.
Then the control stimulants kicked in and in seconds my head cleared from
foggy to the unbearable brightness of sunlight on a knife. The soupy warmth of
the air receded as neural governors retuned my system to cope with the body
temperature shift. Inhaling became a languid pleasure, like drinking hot rum on a
cold night. The cabin of the transport and the people in it were suddenly like a
coded puzzle that I had the solution for if I could just . . .
I felt an inane grin eating its way across my features.
'Whoooh, Kristin, this is . . . good stuff. This is better than Sharya.'
'Glad you like it.' Ortega glanced at her watch. 'Two more minutes. You up to it?'
'I'm up to.' I pursed my lips and blew through them. 'Anything. Anything at all.'

Ortega tipped her head back towards Bautista, who could presumably see the
instrumentation in the cockpit. 'Rod. How long have we got?'
'Be there in less than forty minutes.'
'Better get him the suit.'
While Bautista busied himself with an overhead locker, Ortega delved in her
pocket and produced a hypospray tipped with an unpleasant-looking needle.
'I want you to wear this,' she said. 'Little bit of Organic Damage insurance for
you.'
'A needle?' I shook my head with what felt like machined precision. 'Uh-uh.
You're not sticking that fucking thing in me.'
'It's a tracer filament,' she said patiently. 'And you're not leaving this ship without
it.'
I looked at the gleam on the needle, mind slicing the facts like vegetables for a
bowl of ramen. In the tactical marines we'd used subcutaneous filament to keep
track of operatives on covert operations. In the event that something went wrong,
it gave us a clear fix to pull our people out. In the event that nothing went wrong,
the molecules of the filament broke down into organic residues, usually in under
forty-eight hours.
I glanced across at Davidson.
'What's the range?'
'Hundred klicks.' The young mohican seemed suddenly very competent in the
glow from his screen. 'Search-triggered signal only. It doesn't radiate unless we
call you. Quite safe.'
I shrugged. 'OK. Where do you want to put it?'
Ortega stood up, needle in hand. 'Neck muscles. Nice and close to your stack,
case they chop your head off.'
'Charming.' I got to my feet and turned my back so that she could put the needle

in. There was a brief spike of pain in the cords of muscle at the base of my skull
and then it faded. Ortega patted me on the shoulder.
'You're done. Is he on screen?'
Davidson punched a couple of buttons and nodded in satisfaction. In front of me,
Bautista dumped the grav harness tackle on a seat. Ortega glanced at her watch
and reached for the second dermal.
'Thirty-seven per cent,' she said. 'Ready for the Big Chill?'

It was like being submerged in diamonds.
By the time we hit Head in the Clouds the drug had already eliminated most of
my emotional responses and everything had the sharp and shiny edges of raw
data. Clarity became a substance, a film of understanding that coated all I saw
and heard around me. The stealth suit and the grav harness felt like samurai
armour and when I drew the stungun from its sheath to check the settings, I
could feel the charge coiled in it like a tangible thing.
It was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry I had strapped about
me. The rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
The shard pistol, spider venom loaded, snugged across my lower ribs opposite
the stunner. I dialled the muzzle aperture to wide. At five metres, it would take
down a roomful of opponents with a single shot, with no recoil and in complete
silence. Sarah Sachilowska says Hi.
The dispenser clip of termite microgrenades, each one not much larger or thicker
than a data diskette, secured in a pouch on my left hip. In memoriam Iphigenia
Deme.
The Tebbit knife on my forearm in its neural spring sheath beneath the stealth
suit like a final word.
I reached for the cold feeling that had filled me up outside Jerry's Closed
Quarters and, in the crystalline depths of the Reaper, did not need it.

Mission time.
'Target visual,' called the pilot. 'You want to come up and have a look at this
baby?'
I glanced at Ortega, who shrugged, and the two of us went forward. Ortega
seated herself beside the mohican and slipped on the co-pilot's headset. I
contented myself with standing next to Bautista in the access hatch. The view
was just as good from there.
Most of the Lock-Mit's cockpit was transparent alloy with instrumentation
projected up onto it, permitting the pilot an uninterrupted view of the
surrounding airspace; I remembered the feeling from Sharya, like riding a
slightly concave tray, a tongue of steel or maybe a magic carpet, across the
cloudscape below. A feeling that had been at once dizzying and godlike. I
glanced at the mohican's profile and wondered if he was as detached from that
feeling as I was under the influence of the Reaper.
There were no clouds tonight. Head in the Clouds hung off to the left like a
mountain village seen from afar. A cluster of tiny blue lights singing gently of
homecoming and warmth in the icy black immensity. Kawahara seemed to have
chosen the edge of the world for the whorehouse.
As we banked towards the lights, a squiggle of electronic sound filled the
cockpit and the projected instrumentation dimmed briefly.
'That's it, we're acquired,' said Ortega sharply. 'Here we go. I want a flyby under
the belly. Let them get a good look.'
The mohican said nothing, but the nose of the transport dipped. Ortega reached
up to an instrument panel projected onto the transparency above her head and
touched a button. A hard, male voice crashed into the cabin.
' . . . that you are in restricted airspace. We are under licence to destroy intruding
aircraft. Identify yourself immediately.'
'This is the Bay City police department,' said Ortega laconically. 'Look out your
window and you'll see the stripes. We're up here on official police business, pal,
so if you so much as twitch a launcher in this direction I'll have you blown out of
the sky.'

There was a hissing silence. Ortega turned to look at me and grinned. Ahead of
us, Head in the Clouds swelled like the target in a missile scope and then lifted
abruptly over our heads as the pilot dipped us below the bulk of its hull and
banked about. I saw lights gathered like icy fruit on gantries and the undersides
of landing pads, the distended belly of the vessel curving up on either side and
then we were past.
'State the nature of your business,' snapped the voice nastily.
Ortega peered out of the side of the cockpit as if looking for the speaker in
amongst the airship's superstructure. Her voice grew chilly. 'Sonny, I've already
told you the nature of our business. Now get me a landing pad.'
More silence. We circled the airship five kilometres out. I started to pull on the
gloves of the stealth suit.
'Lieutenant Ortega.' It was Kawahara's voice this time, but in the depths of the
betathanatine, even hatred seemed detached and I had to remind myself to feel it.
Most of me was assessing the rapidity with which they had voiceprinted Ortega.
'This is a little unexpected. Do you have some kind of warrant? I believe our
licences are in order.'
Ortega raised an eyebrow at me. The voiceprinting had impressed her too. She
cleared her throat. 'This is not a licensing matter. We are looking for a fugitive. If
you're going to start insisting on warrants, I might have to assume you've got a
guilty conscience.'
'Don't threaten me, lieutenant,' said Kawahara coldly. 'Do you have any idea who
you're talking to?'
'Reileen Kawahara, I imagine.' In the deathly silence that followed Ortega made
a jubilant punching gesture at the ceiling and turned to grin at me. The barb had
gone home. I felt the faintest ripple of amusement catch at the corners of my
mouth.
'Perhaps you'd better tell me the name of this fugitive, lieutenant.' Kawahara's
voice had gone as smooth as the expression on an untenanted synthetic sleeve.
'His name is Takeshi Kovacs,' said Ortega, with another grin at me. 'But he's
currently sleeved in the body of an ex-police officer. I'd like to ask you some

questions concerning your relationship with this man.'
There was another long pause, and I knew the lure was going to work. I'd crafted
its multiple layers with all the care of the finest Envoy deceit. Kawahara almost
certainly knew of the relationship between Ortega and Ryker, could probably
guess Ortega's entanglement with the new tenant of her lover's sleeve. She would
buy Ortega's anxiety at my disappearance. She would buy Ortega's unsanctioned
approach to Head in the Clouds. Given an assumed communication between
Kawahara and Miriam Bancroft, she would believe she knew where I was and
she would be confident that she had the upper hand over Ortega.
But more important than all of this, she would want to know how the Bay City
police knew she was aboard Head in the Clouds. And since it was likely that
they had, either directly or indirectly, gleaned the fact from Takeshi Kovacs, she
would want to know how he knew. She would want to know how much he knew,
and how much he had told the police.
She would want to talk to Ortega.
I fastened the wrist seals of the stealth suit and waited. We completed our third
circuit of Head in the Clouds.
'You'd better come aboard,' said Kawahara finally. 'Starboard landing beacon.
Follow it in, they'll give you a code.'

The Lock-Mit was equipped with a rear dispatch tube, a smaller, civilian variant
of the drop launcher that on military models was intended for smart bombs or
surveillance drones. The tube was accessed through the floor of the main cabin
and with a certain amount of contortion I fitted inside, complete with stealth suit,
grav harness and assorted weaponry. We'd practised this three or four times on
the ground, but now with the transport swinging in towards Head in the Clouds,
it suddenly seemed a long and complicated process. Finally, I got the last of the
grav harness inside and Ortega rapped once on the suit's helmet before she
slammed the hatch down and buried me in darkness.
Three seconds later the tube blew open and spat me backwards into the night
sky.

The sensation was a dimly remembered joy, something this sleeve did not recall
at a cellular level. From the cramped confines of the tube and the noisy vibration
of the transport's engines I was suddenly blasted into absolute space and silence.
Not even the rush of air made it through the foam padding on the suit's helmet as
I fell. The grav harness kicked in as soon as I was clear of the tube and braked
my fall before it got properly started. I felt myself borne up on its field, not quite
motionless, like a ball bobbing on top of the column of water from a fountain.
Pivoting about, I watched the navigation lights of the transport shrink inward
against the bulk of Head in the Clouds.
The airship hung above and before me like a threatening storm cloud. Lights
glimmered out at me from the curving hull and the gantried superstructure
beneath. Ordinarily it would have given me the cringing sensation of being a
sitting target, but the betathanatine soothed the emotions away in a clean rush of
data detail. In the stealth suit I was as black as the surrounding sky and all but
radar invisible. The grav field I was generating might theoretically show up on a
scanner somewhere, but within the huge distortions produced by the airship's
stabilisers they'd need to be looking for me, and looking quite hard. All these
things I knew with an absolute confidence that had no room for doubts, fears or
other emotional tangling. I was riding the Reaper.
I set the impellers in cautious forward drive and drifted towards the massive,
curving wall of the hull. Inside the helmet, simulation graphics awoke on the
surface of the visor and I saw the entry points Irene Elliott had found for me
delineated in red. One in particular, the unsealed mouth of a disused sampling
turret, was pulsing on and off next to fine green lettering that spelled Prospect
One. I rose steadily upward to meet it.
The turret mouth was about a metre wide and scarred around the edges where the
atmosphere sampling system had been amputated. I got my legs up in front of
me — no mean achievement in a grav field — and hooked myself over the lip of
the hatch, then concentrated on worming myself inside up to the waist. From
there I twisted onto my front to clear the grav harness and was able to slide
myself through the gap and onto the floor of the turret. I switched the grav
harness off.
Inside, there was barely enough crawlspace tor a technician lying on his back to
check the nest of equipment. At the back of the turret was an antique airlock,
complete with pressure wheel, just as Irene Elliott's Dipped blueprints had

promised. I wriggled around until I could grasp the wheel with both hands,
conscious that both suit and harness were catching on the narrow hatchway, and
that my exertions so far had almost totally depleted my immediate body strength.
I drew a deep breath to fuel my comatose muscles, waited for my slowed
heartbeat to pump the oxygen round my body and heaved at the wheel. Against
my expectations it turned quite easily and the airlock hatch fell outward. Beyond
the hatch was an airy darkness.
I lay still for a while, mustering more muscular strength. The two-shot Reaper
cocktail was taking some getting used to. On Sharya we hadn't needed to go
above twenty per cent. Ambient temperatures in Zihicce were quite high and the
spider tanks' infrared sensors were crude. Up here, a body at Sharyan room
temperature would set off every alarm in hull. Without careful oxygen fuelling,
my body would rapidly exhaust its cellular level energy reserves and leave me
gasping on the floor like a gaffed bottleback. I lay-still, breathing deep and slow.
After a couple of minutes, I twisted around again and unfastened the grav
harness, then slid carefully through the hatch and hit a steel grid walkway with
the heels of my hands. I curled the rest of my body slowly out of the hatch,
feeling like a moth emerging from a chrysalis. Checking the darkened walkway
in either direction I rose to my feet and removed the stealth suit helmet and
gloves. If the keel plans Irene Elliott had Dipped from the Tampa aeroyard stack
were still accurate, the walkway led down among the huge helium silos to the
vessel's aft buoyancy control room and from there I'd be able to climb a
maintenance ladder directly onto the main operating deck. According to what
we'd patched together out of Miller's interrogation, Kawahara's quarters were
two levels below on the port side. She had two huge windows that looked
downward out of the hull.
Summoning the blueprints from memory, I drew the shard pistol and set off
towards the stern.

It took me less than fifteen minutes to reach the buoyancy control room, and I
saw no one on the way. The control room itself appeared to be automated and I
began to suspect that these days hardly anyone bothered to visit the swooping
canopies of the airship's upper hull. I found the maintenance ladder and climbed
painstakingly down it until a warm upward-spilling glow on my face told me I

was almost on the operating deck. I stopped and listened for voices, hearing and
proximity sense both strained to their limits for a full minute before I lowered
myself the final four metres and dropped to the floor of a well lit, carpeted
passageway. It was deserted in both directions.
I checked my internal time display and stowed the shard gun. Mission time was
accumulating. By now Ortega and Kawahara would be talking. I glanced around
at the decor and guessed that whatever function the operating deck had once
been intended to serve, it wasn't serving it now. The passageway was decked out
in opulent red and gold with stands of exotic plant life and lamps in the form of
coupling bodies every few metres. The carpet beneath my feet was deep, and
woven with highly detailed images of sexual abandon. Male, female and variants
between twined around each other along the length of the corridor in an
unbroken progression of plugged orifices and splayed limbs. The walls were
hung with similarly explicit holoframes that gasped and moaned into life as I
passed them. In one of them I thought I recognised the dark-haired, crimsonlipped woman of the street 'cast advertisement, the woman who might have
pressed her thigh against mine in a bar on the other side of the globe.
In the cold detachment of the betathanatine, none of it had any more impact than
a wall full of Martian techno-glyphs.
There were plushly appointed double doors set into each side of the corridor at
about ten-metre intervals. It didn't take much imagination to work out what was
behind the doors. Jerry's biocabins, by any other name, and each door was just as
likely as not to disgorge a client at any moment. I quickened my pace, searching
for a connecting corridor that: I knew led to stairs and elevators onto the other
levels.
I was almost there when a door five metres ahead of me swung open. I froze,
hand on the grip of the shard gun, shoulders to the wall, gaze gripped to the
leading edge of the door. The neurachem thrummed.
In front of me, a grey furred animal that was either half-grown wolf cub or dog
emerged from the open door with arthritic slowness. I kept my hand on the shard
gun and eased away from the wall, watching. The animal was not much over
knee height and it moved on all fours, but there was something badly wrong with
the structure of the rear legs. Something wrenched. Its ears were laid back and a
minute keening came from its throat. It turned its head towards me and for a

moment my hand tightened on the shard gun, but the animal only looked at me
for a moment and the mute suffering in its eyes was enough to tell me I was in
no danger. Then it limped painfully along the corridor to a room farther down on
the opposite wall and paused there, the long head down close to the door as if
listening.
With a dreamlike sense of lost control, I followed and leaned my own head
against the surface of the door. The soundproofing was good, but no match for
the Khumalo neurachem at full stretch. Somewhere down near the limits of
hearing, noises trickled into my ear like stinging insects. A dull, rhythmic
thudding sound and something else that might have been the pleading screams of
someone whose strength was almost gone. It stopped almost as soon as I had
tuned it in.
Below me, the dog stopped keening at the same moment and lay down on the
ground beside the door. When I stepped away, it looked up at me once with a
gaze of pure distilled pain and reproach. In those eyes I could see reflected every
victim that had ever looked at me in the last three decades of my waking life.
Then the animal turned its head away and licked apathetically at its injured rear
legs.
For a split second, something geysered through the cold crust of the
betathanatine.
I went back to the door the animal had emerged from, drawing the shard gun on
my way and swung through, holding the weapon in both hands before me. The
room beyond was spacious and pastel-coloured with quaint two-dimensional
framed pictures on the walls. A massive four poster bed with translucent drapes
occupied the centre. Seated on the edge of the bed was a distinguished-looking
man in his forties, naked from the waist down. Above the waist, he appeared to
be wearing formal evening dress which clashed badly with the heavy-duty
canvas work gloves he had pulled up to both elbows. He was bent over, cleaning
himself between the legs with a damp white cloth.
As I advanced into the room, he glanced up.
'Jack? You finished al — ' He stared at the gun in my hands without
comprehension, then as the muzzle came to within half a metre of his face a note
of asperity crept into his voice. 'Listen, I didn't dial for this routine.'

'On the house,' I said dispassionately, and watched as the clutch of
monomglecular shards tore his face apart. His hands flew up from between his
legs to cover the wounds and he flopped over sideways on the bed, gut-deep
noises grinding out of him as he died.
With the mission time display flaring red in the corner of my vision, I backed out
of the room. The injured animal outside the door opposite did not look up as I
approached. I knelt and laid one hand gently on the matted fur. The head lifted
and the keening rose in the throat again. I set down the shard gun and tensed my
empty hand. The neural sheath delivered the Tebbit knife, glinting.
After, I cleaned the blade on the fur, resheathed the knife and picked up the shard
gun, all with the unhurried calm of the Reaper. Then I moved silently to the
connecting corridor. Deep in the diamond serenity of the drug something was
nagging at me, but the Reaper would not let me worry about it.
As indicated on Elliott's stolen blueprints the cross corridor led to a set of stairs,
carpeted in the same orgiastic pattern as the main thoroughfare. I moved warily
down the steps, gun tracking the open space ahead, proximity sense spread like a
radar net before me. Nothing stirred. Kawahara must have battened down all the
hatches just in case Ortega and her crew saw something inconvenient while they
were on the premises.
Two levels down, I stepped off the stairs and followed my memory of the
blueprints through a mesh of corridors until I was reasonably sure that the door
to Kawahara's quarters was around the next corner. With my back to the wall, I
slid up to the corner and waited, breathing shallowly. The proximity sense said
there was someone at the door around the corner, possibly more than one person,
and I picked up the faint tang of cigarette smoke. I dropped to my knees,
checked my surroundings and then lowered my face to the ground. With one
cheek brushing the pile of the carpet, I eased my head around the corner.
A man and a woman stood by the door, similarly dressed in green coveralls. The
woman was smoking. Although each of them had stunguns bolstered importantly
at their belts, they looked more like technical staff than security attendants. I
relaxed fractionally and settled down to wait some more. In the corner of my
eye, the minutes of mission time pulsed like an overstressed vein.
It was another quarter of an hour before I heard the door. At full amp, the

neurachem caught the rustle of clothing as the attendants moved to allow
whoever was leaving to exit. I heard voices, Ortega's flat with pretended official
disinterest, then Kawahara's, as modulated as the mandroid in Larkin & Green.
With the betathanatine to protect me from the hatred, my reaction to that voice
was a muted horizon event, like the flare and crash of gunfire at a great distance.
' . . . that I cannot be of more assistance, lieutenant. If what you say about the
Wei Clinic is true, his mental balance has certainly deteriorated since he worked
for me. I feel a certain responsibility. I mean, I would never have recommended
him to Laurens Bancroft, had I suspected this would happen.'
'As I said, this is supposition.' Ortega's tone sharpened slightly. 'And I'd
appreciate it if these details didn't go any further. Until we know where Kovacs
has gone, and why — '
'Quite. I quite understand the sensitivity of the matter. You are aboard Head in
the Clouds, lieutenant. We have a reputation for confidentiality.'
'Yeah.' Ortega allowed a stain of distaste into her voice. 'I've heard that.'
'Well, then, you can rest assured that this will not be spoken of. Now if you'll
excuse me, lieutenant. Detective sergeant. I have some administrative matters to
attend to. Tia and Max will see you back to the flight deck.'
The door closed and soft footfalls advanced in my direction. I tensed abruptly.
Ortega and her escort were coming in my direction. This was something no one
had bargained for. On the blueprints the main landing pads were forward of
Kawahara's cabin, and I'd come up on the aft side with that in mind. There
seemed no reason to march Ortega and Bautista towards the stern.
There was no panic. Instead, a cool analogue of the adrenalin reaction rinsed
through my mind, offering a chilly array of hard facts. Ortega and Bautista were
in no danger. They must have arrived the same way they were leaving or
something would have been said. As for me, if they passed the corridor I was in,
their escort would only have to glance sideways to see me. The area was well lit
and there were no hiding places within reach. On the other hand, with my body
down below room temperature, my pulse slowed to a crawl and my breathing at
the same low, most of the subliminal factors that will trigger a normal human
being's proximity sense were gone. Always assuming the escorts were wearing
normal sleeves.

And if they turned into this corridor to use the stairs I had come down by . . .
I shrank back against the wall, dialled the shard gun down to minimum dispersal
and stopped breathing.
Ortega. Bautista. The two attendants brought up the rear. They were so close I
could have reached out and touched Ortega's hair.
No one looked round.
I gave them a full minute before I breathed again. Then I checked the corridor in
both directions, went rapidly round the corner and knocked on the door with the
butt of the shard gun. Without waiting for a reply, I walked in.

CHAPTER FORTY-ONE

The chamber was exactly as Miller had described it. Twenty metres wide and
walled in non-reflective glass that sloped inward from roof to floor. On a clear
day you could probably lie on that slope and peer down thousands of metres to
the sea below. The decor was stark and owed a lot to Kawahara's early
millennium roots. The walls were smoke grey, the floor fused glass and the
lighting came from jagged pieces of origami performed in illuminum sheeting
and spiked on iron tripods in the corners of the room. One side of the room was
dominated by a massive slab of black steel that must serve as a desk, the other
held a group of shale-coloured loungers grouped around an imitation oil drum
brazier. Beyond the loungers, an arched doorway led out to what Miller had
surmised were sleeping quarters.

Above the desk, a slow weaving holodisplay of data had been abandoned to its
own devices. Reileen Kawahara stood with her back to the door, staring out at
the night sky.
'Forget something?' she asked distantly.
'No, not a thing.'
I saw how her back stiffened as she heard me, but when she turned it was with
unhurried smoothness and even the sight of the shard gun didn't crack the icy

calm on her face. Her voice was almost as disinterested as it had been before she
turned.
'Who are you? How did you get in here?'
'Think about it.' I gestured at the loungers. 'Sit down over there, take the weight
off your feet while you're thinking.'
'Kadmin?'
'Now you're insulting me. Sit down!'
I saw the realisation explode behind her eyes.
'Kovacs?' An unpleasant smile bent at her lips. 'Kovacs, you stupid, stupid
bastard. Do you have any idea what you've just thrown away?'
'I said sit down.'
'She has gone, Kovacs. Back to Harlan’s World. I kept my word. What do you
think you're doing here?'
'I'm not going to tell you again,' I said mildly. 'Either you sit down now, or I'll
break one of your kneecaps.'
The thin smile stayed on Kawahara's mouth as she lowered herself a centimetre
at a time onto the nearest lounger. 'Very well, Kovacs. We'll play to your script
tonight. And then I'll have that fishwife Sachilowska dragged all the way back
here and you with her. What are you going to do? Kill me?'
'If necessary.'
'For what? Is this some kind of moral stand?' The emphasis Kawahara laid on the
last two words made it sound like the name of a product. 'Aren't you forgetting
something? If you kill me here, it'll take about eighteen hours for the remote
storage system in Europe to notice and then re-sleeve me from my last update
'cast. And it won't take the new me very long to work out what happened up
here.'
I seated myself on the edge of the lounger. 'Oh, I don't know. Look how long it's

taken Bancroft, and he still doesn't have the truth, does he?'
'Is this about Bancroft?'
'No Reileen. This is about you and me. You should have left Sarah alone. You
should have left me alone while you could.'
'Ohhh,' she cooed, mock maternal. 'Did you get manipulated. I'm sorry.' She
dropped the tone just as abruptly. 'You're an Envoy , Kovacs. You live by
manipulation. We all do. We all live in the great manipulation matrix and it's just
one big struggle to stay on top.'
I shook my head. 'I didn't ask to be dealt in.'
'Kovacs, Kovacs.' Kawahara's expression was suddenly almost tender. 'None of
us ask to be dealt in. You think I asked to be born in Fission City, with a webfingered dwarf for a father and a psychotic whore for a mother. You think I asked
for that? We're not dealt in, we're thrown in, and after that it's just about keeping
your head above water.'
'Or pouring water down other people's throats,' I agreed amiably. 'I guess you
took after your mother, right?'
For a second it was as if Kawahara's face was a mask cut from tin behind which
a furnace was raging. I saw the fury ignite in her eyes and if I had not had the
Reaper inside to keep me cold, I would have been afraid.
'Kill me,' she said, tight-lipped. 'And make the most of it, because you are going
to suffer, Kovacs. You think those sad-case revolutionaries on New Beijing
suffered when they died? I'm going to invent new limits for you and your fishsmelling bitch.'
I shook my head. 'I don't think so, Reileen. You see, your update needlecast went
through about ten minutes ago. And on the way I had it Dipped. Didn't lift
anything, we just spliced the Rawling virus onto the 'cast. It's in the core by now,
Reileen. Your remote storage has been spiked.'
Her eyes narrowed. 'You're lying.'
'Not today. You liked the work Irene Elliott did at Jack It Up? Well you should

see her in a virtual forum. I bet she had time to take a half dozen mindbites while
she was inside that needlecast. Souvenirs. Collector's items in fact, because if I
know anything about stack engineers, they'll weld down the lid on your remote
stack faster than politicians leaving a war zone.' I nodded over at the winding
data display. 'I should think you'll get the alarm in another couple of hours. It
took longer at Innenin but that was a long time ago. The technology's moved on
since then.'
Then she believed, and it was as if the fury I'd seen in her eyes had banked down
to a concentrated white heat.
'Irene Elliott,' she said intently. 'When I find her — '
'I think we've had enough empty threats for one day,' I interrupted without force.
'Listen to me. Currently the stack you're wearing is the only life you have, and
the mood I'm in now it wouldn't take much to make me cut it out of your spine
and stamp on it. Before or after I shoot you, so shut up.'
Kawahara sat still, glaring at me out of slitted eyes. Her top lip drew fractionally
back off her teeth for a moment, before control asserted itself.
'What do you want?'
'Better. What I want, right now, is a full confession of how you set Bancroft up.
Resolution 653, Mary Lou Hinchley, the whole thing. You can throw in how you
framed Ryker as well.'
'Are you wired for this?'
I tapped my left eyelid where the recording system had gone in and smiled.
'You really think I'm going to do this?' Kawahara's rage glinted at me from
behind her eyes. She was waiting, coiled, for an opening. I had seen her like this
before, but then I hadn't been on the receiving end of that look. I was in as much
danger under those eyes as I had ever been under fire in the streets of Sharya.
'You really think you're going to get this from me?'
'Look on the bright side, Reileen. You can probably buy and influence your way
out of the erasure penalty, and for the rest you might only get a couple of
hundred years in the store.' My voice hardened. 'Whereas, if you don't talk, you'll

die right here and now.'
'Confession under duress is inadmissible under law.'
'Don't make me laugh. This isn't going to the UN. You think I've never been in a
court before? You think I'd trust lawyers to deal with this? Everything you say
here tonight is going express needlecast to WorldWeb One as soon as I'm back
on the ground. That, and footage of whoever it was I wasted in the doggie room
upstairs.' Kawahara's eyes widened and I nodded. 'Yeah, I should have said
earlier. You're a client down. Not really dead, but he'll need re-sleeving. Now
with all that, I reckon about three minutes after Sandy Kim goes live, the UN
tacs are going to be blowing down your door with a fistful of warrants. They'll
have no choice. Bancroft alone will force their hand. You think the same people
who authorised Sharya and Innenin are going to stick at a little constitutional
rule bending to protect their power base? Now start talking.'
Kawahara raised her eyebrows, as if this was nothing more than a slightly
distasteful joke she'd just been told. 'Where would you like me to start, Takeshisan?'
'Mary Lou Hinchley. She fell from here, right?'
'Of course.'
'You had her slated for the snuff deck? Some sick fuck wanted to pull on the
tiger sleeve and play kitty?'
'Well, well.' Kawahara tipped her head on one side as she made connections.
'Who have you been talking to? Someone from the Wei Clinic, is it? Let me
think. Miller was here for that little object lesson, but you torched him, so . . .
Oh. You haven't been headhunting again, Takeshi? You didn't take Felipe Miller
home in a hatbox, did you?'
I said nothing, just looked at her over the barrel of the shard gun, hearing again
the weakened screaming through the door I'd listened at. Kawahara shrugged.
'It wasn't the tiger, as it happens. But something of that sort, yes.'
'And she found out?'

'Somehow, yes.' Kawahara seemed to be relaxing, which under normal
circumstances would have made me nervous. Under the betathanatine, it just
made me more watchful. 'A word in the wrong place, maybe something a
technician said. You know, we usually put our snuff clients through a virtual
version before we let them loose on the real thing. It helps to know how they're
going to react, and in some cases we even persuade them not: to go through with
it.'
'Very thoughtful of you.'
Kawahara sighed. 'How do I get through to you, Takeshi? We provide a service
here. If it can be made legal, then so much the better.'
'That's bullshit, Reileen. You sell them the virtual, and in a couple of months
they come sniffing after the real thing. There's a causal link, and you know it.
Selling them something illegal gives you leverage, probably over some very
influential people. Get many UN governors up here, do you? Protectorate
generals, that kind of scum?'
'Head in the Clouds caters to an elite.'
'Like that white-haired fuck I greased upstairs? He was someone important, was
he?'
'Carlton McCabe?' From somewhere, Kawahara produced an alarming smile.
'You could say that, I suppose, yes. A person of influence.'
'Would you care to tell me which particular person of influence you'd promised
they could rip the innards out of Mary Lou Hinchley?'
Kawahara tautened slightly. 'No, I would not.'
'Suppose not. You'll want that for a bargaining line later, won't you? OK, skip it.
So what happened? Hinchley was brought up here, accidentally found out what
she was being fattened up for and tried to escape? Stole a grav harness, perhaps?'
'I doubt that. The equipment is kept under tight security. Perhaps she thought she
could cling to the outside of one of the shuttles. She was not a very bright girl,
apparently. The details are still unclear, but she must have fallen somehow.'

'Or jumped.'
Kawahara shook her head. 'I don't think she had the stomach for that. Mary Lou
Hinchley was not a samurai spirit. Like most of common humanity, she would
have clung to life until the last undignified moment. Hoping for some miracle.
Begging for mercy.'
'How inelegant. Was she missed immediately?'
'Of course she was missed! She had a client waiting for her. We scoured the
ship.'
'Embarrassing.'
'Yes.'
'But not as embarrassing as having her wash up on the shore a couple of days
later, huh? The luck fairies were out of town that week.'
'It was unfortunate,' Kawahara conceded, as if we were discussing a bad hand of
poker. 'But not entirely unexpected. We were not anticipating a real problem.'
'You knew she was Catholic?'
'Of course. It was part of the requirements.'
'So when Ryker dug up that iffy conversion, you must have shat yourself.
Hinchley's testimony would have dragged you right into the open, along with
fuck knows how many of your influential friends. Head in the Clouds, one of the
Houses, indicted for snuff and you with it. What was the word you used on New
Beijing that time? Intolerable risk. Something had to be done, Ryker had to be
shut down. Stop me if I'm losing the thread here.'
'No, you're quite correct.'
'So you framed him?'
Kawahara shrugged again. 'An attempt: was made to buy him off. He proved . . .
unreceptive.'

'Unfortunate. So what did you do then?'
'You don't know?'
'I want to hear you say it. I want details. I'm doing too much of the talking here.
Try to keep your end of the conversation up, or I might think you're being
uncooperative.'
Kawahara raised her eyes theatrically to the ceiling. 'I framed Elias Ryker. I set
him up with a false tip about a clinic in Seattle. We built a phone construct of
Ryker and used it to pay Ignacio Garcia to fake the Reasons of Conscience
decals on two of Ryker's kills. We knew the Seattle PD wouldn't buy it and that
Garcia's faking wouldn't stand up to close scrutiny. There, is that better?'
'Where'd you get Garcia from?'
'Research on Ryker, back when we were: trying to buy him off.' Kawahara
shifted impatiently on the lounger. 'The connection came up.'
'Yeah, that's what I figured.'
'How perceptive of you.'
'So everything was nicely nailed down. Until Resolution 653 came along, and
stirred it all up again. And Hinchley was still a live case.'
Kawahara inclined her head. 'Just so.'
'Why didn't you just stall it? Buy some decision makers on the UN Council?'
'Who? This isn't New Beijing. You met Phiri and Ertekin. Do they look as if
they're for sale?:
I nodded. 'So it was you in Marco's sleeve. Did Miriam Bancroft know?'
'Miriam?' Kawahara looked perplexed. 'Of course not. No one knew, that was the
point. Marco plays Miriam on a regular basis. It was a perfect cover.'
'Not perfect. You play shit tennis, apparently.'
'I didn't have time for a competence disc,'

'Why Marco? Why not just go as yourself?'
Kawahara waved a hand. 'I'd been hammering at Bancroft since the resolution
was tabled. Ertekin too, whenever she let me near her. I was making myself conspicuous. Marco putting in a word on my behalf makes me look more detached.'
'You took that call from Rutherford,' I said, mostly to myself. 'The one to
Suntouch House after we dropped in on him. I figured it was Miriam, but you
were there as a guest, playing Marco on the sidelines of the great Catholic
debate.'
'Yes.' A faint smile. 'You seem to have greatly overestimated Miriam Bancroft's
role in all this. Oh, by the way, who is that you've got wearing Ryker's sleeve at
the moment? Just to satisfy my curiosity. They're very convincing, whover they
are.'
I said nothing, but a smile leaked from one corner of my mouth. Kawahara
caught it.
'Really? Double sleeving. You really must have Lieutenant Ortega wrapped
around your little finger. Or wrapped around something, anyway.
Congratulations. Manipulation worthy of a Meth.' She barked a short laugh.
'That was meant as a compliment, Takeshi-san.'
I ignored the jibe. 'You talked to Bancroft in Osaka? Thursday 16th August. You
knew he was going?'
'Yes. He has regular business there. It was made to look like a chance encounter.
I invited him to Head in the Clouds on his return. It's a pattern for him. Buying
sex after business deals. You probably found that out.'
'Yeah. So when you got him up here, what did you tell him?'
'I told him the truth.'
'The truth?' I stared at her. 'You told him about Hinchley, and expected him to
back you?'
'Why not?' There was a chilling simplicity in the look she gave me back. 'We

have a friendship that goes back centuries. Common business strategies that have
sometimes taken longer than a normal human lifetime to bring to fruition. I
hardly expected him to side with the little people.'
'So he disappointed you. He wouldn't keep the Meth faith.'
Kawahara sighed again, and this time there was a genuine weariness in it that
gusted out of somewhere centuries deep in dust.
'Laurens maintains a cheap romantic streak that I continually underestimate. He
is not unlike you in many ways. But, unlike you, he has no excuse for it. The
man is over three centuries old. I assumed — wanted to assume, perhaps — that
his values would reflect that. That the rest was just posturing, speechmaking for
the herd.' Kawahara made a negligent what-can-you-do gesture with one slim
arm. 'Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.'
'What did he do? Take some kind of moral stand?'
Kawahara's mouth twisted without humour. 'You mock me? You, with the blood
of dozens from the Wei Clinic fresh on your hands. A butcher for the
Protectorate, an extinguisher of human life on every world where it has managed
to find a foothold. You are, if I may say so, Takeshi, a little inconsistent.'
Secure in the cool wrap of the betathanatine, I could feel nothing beyond a mild
irritation at Kawahara's obtuseness. A need to clarify.
'The Wei Clinic was personal.'
'The Wei Clinic was business, Takeshi. They had no personal interest in you at
all. Most of the people you wiped were merely doing their jobs.'
'Then they should have chosen another job.'
'And the people of Sharya. What choice should they have made? Not to be born
on that particular world, at that particular time? Not to allow themselves to be
conscripted, perhaps?'
'I was young and stupid,' I said simply. 'I was used. I killed for people like you
because I knew no better. Then I learnt better. What happened at Innenin taught
me better. Now I don't kill for anyone but myself, and every time that I take a

life, I know the value of it.'
'The value of it. The value of a human life.' Kawahara shook her head like a
teacher with an exasperating student. 'You are still young and stupid. Human life
has no value. Haven't you learned that yet, Takeshi, with all you've seen? It has
no value, intrinsic to itself. Machines cost money to build. Raw materials cost
money to extract. But people?' She made a tiny spitting sound. 'You can always
get some more people. They reproduce like cancer cells, whether you want them
or not. They are abundant, Takeshi. Why should they be valuable? Do you know
that it costs us less to recruit and use up a real snuff whore than it does to set up
and run the virtual equivalent format. Real human flesh is cheaper than a
machine. It's the axiomatic truth of our times.'
'Bancroft didn't think so.'
'Bancroft?' Kawahara made a disgusted noise deep in her throat. 'Bancroft is a
cripple, limping along on his archaic notions. It's a mystery to me how he's
survived this long.'
'So you programmed him to suicide? Gave him a little chemical push?'
'Programmed him to . . . ' Kawahara's eyes widened and a delighted chuckle that
was just the right blend of husk and chime issued from her sculpted lips.
'Kovacs, you can't be that stupid. I told you he killed himself. It was his idea, not
mine. There was a time when you trusted my word, even if you couldn't stomach
my company. Think about it. Why would I want him dead?'
'To erase what you told him about Hinchley. When he was re-sleeved, his last
update would be minus that little indiscretion.'
Kawahara nodded sagely. 'Yes, I can see how that would fit for you. A defensive
move. You have, after all, existed on the defensive since you left the Envoys.
And a creature that lives on the defensive sooner or later comes to think on the
defensive. You are forgetting one thing, Takeshi.'
She paused dramatically, and even through the betathanatine, a vague ripple of
mistrust tugged at me. Kawahara was overplaying it.
'And what's that?'

'That I, Takeshi Kovacs, am not you. I do not play on the defensive.'
'Not even at tennis?'
She offered me a calibrated little smile. 'Very witty. I did not need to erase
Laurens Bancroft's memory of our conversation, because by then he had
slaughtered his own Catholic whore, and had as much to lose as I from Resolution 653.'
I blinked. I'd had a variety of theories circling around the central conviction that
Kawahara was responsible for Bancroft's death, but none quite this garish. But as
Kawahara's words sank in, so did a number of pieces from that jagged mirror I'd
thought was already complete enough to see the truth in. I looked into a newly
revealed corner and wished I had not seen the things that moved there.
Opposite me, Kawahara grinned at my silence. She knew she'd dented me, and it
pleased her. Vanity, vanity. Kawahara's only but enduring flaw. Like all Meths,
she had grown very impressed with herself. The admission, the final piece to my
jigsaw, had slipped out easily. She wanted me to have it, she wanted me to see
how far ahead of me she was, how far behind her I was limping along.
That crack about the tennis must have touched a nerve.
'Another subtle echo of his wife's face,' she said, 'carefully selected and then
amped up with a little cosmetic surgery. He choked the life out of her. As he was
coming for the second time, I think. Married life, eh Kovacs? What it must do to
you males.'
'You got it on tape?' My voice sounded stupid in my own ears.
Kawahara's smile came back. 'Come on, Kovacs. Ask me something that needs
an answer.'
'Bancroft was chemically assisted?'
'Oh, but of course. You were right about that. Quite a nasty drug, but then I
expect you know — '
It was the betathanatine. The heart-dragging slow chill of the drug, because
without it I would have been moving with the breath of air as the door opened on

my flank. The thought crossed my mind as rapidly as it was able, and even as it
did I knew by its very presence that I was going to be too slow. This was no time
for thinking. Thought in combat was a luxury about as appropriate as a hot bath
and massage. It fogged the whiplash clarity of the Khumalo's neurachem
response system and I spun, just a couple of centuries too late, shard gun lifting.
Splat!
The stun bolt slammed through me like a train, and I seemed to see the brightly
lit carriage windows ratcheting past behind my eyes. My vision was a frozen
frame on Trepp, crouched in the doorway, stungun extended, face watchful in
case she'd missed or I was wearing neural armour beneath the stealth suit. Some
hope. My own weapon dropped from nerveless fingers as my hand spasmed
open and I pitched forward beside it. The wooden floor came up and smashed
me on the side of the head like one of my father's cuffs.
'What kept you?' asked Kawahara's voice from a great height, distorted to a bass
growl by my fading consciousness. One slim hand reached into my field of
vision and retrieved the shard gun. Numbly, I felt her other hand tug the stungun
free of the other holster.
'Alarm only went off a couple of minutes ago.' Trepp stepped into view, stowing
her stungun, and crouched to look at me curiously. 'Took McCabe a while to cool
off enough to trip the system. Most of your half-assed security is still up on the
main deck, goggling at the corpse. Who's this?'
'It's Kovacs,' said Kawahara dismissively, tucking the shard gun and stunner into
her belt on her way to the desk. To my paralysed gaze, she appeared to be
retreating across a vast plain, hundreds of metres with every stride until she was
tiny and distant. Doll-like, she leaned on the desk and punched at controls I
could not see.
I wasn't going under.
'Kovacs?' Trepp's face went abruptly impassive. 'I thought — '
'Yes, so did I.' The holographic data weave above the desk awoke and unwound.
Kawahara put her face closer, colours swirling over her features. 'He doublesleeved on us. Presumably with Ortega's help. You should have stuck around the
Panama Rose a little longer.'

My hearing was still mangled, my vision frozen in place, but I wasn't going
under. I wasn't sure if it was some sideeffect of the betathanatine, another bonus
feature of the Khumalo system, or maybe both in some unintended conjunction,
but something was keeping me conscious.
'Being around a crime scene with that many cops makes me nervous,' said Trepp
and put out a hand to touch my face.
'Yeah?' Kawahara was still absorbed in the dataflow. 'Well, distracting this
psycho with moral debate and true confessions hasn't been good for my
digestion, either. I thought you were never going to — Fuck!'
She jerked her head savagely to one side, then lowered it and stared at the
surface of the desk.
'He was telling the truth.'
'About what?'
Kawahara looked up at Trepp, suddenly guarded. 'Doesn't: matter. What are you
doing to his face?'
'He's cold.'
'Of course he's fucking cold.' The deteriorating language was a sure sign that
Reileen Kawahara was rattled, I thought dreamily. 'How do you think he got in
past the infrareds? He's Stiffed to the eyes.'
Trepp got up, face carefully expressionless. 'What are you going to do with him?'
'He's going into virtual,' said Kawahara grimly. 'Along with his Harlanite
fishwife friend. But before we do that, we have to perform a little surgery. He's
wearing a wire.'
I tried to move my right hand. The last joint of the middle finger twitched,
barely.
'You sure he isn't transmitting?'
'Yeah, he told me. Anyway, we would have nailed the transmission, soon as it

started. Have you got a knife?'
A bone-deep tremor that felt suspiciously like panic ran through me. Desperately,
I reached down into the paralysis for some sign of impending recovery. The
Khumalo nervous system was still reeling. I could feel my eyes drying out from
the lack of a blink reflex. Through smearing vision, I watched Kawahara coming
back from the desk, hand held out expectantly to Trepp.
'I don't have a knife.' I couldn't be certain with the wow and flutter of my
hearing, but Trepp's voice sounded rebellious.
'No problem.' Kawahara took more long strides and disappeared from view,
voice fading. 'I've got something back here that'll do just as well. You'd better
whistle up some muscle to drag this piece of shit up to one of the decanting
salons. I think seven and nine are prepped. Use the jack on the desk.'
Trepp hesitated. I felt something drop, like a tiny piece of ice thawing from the
frozen block of my central nervous system. My eyelids scraped slowly down
over my eyes, once and up again. The cleansing contact brought tears. Trepp saw
it and stiffened. She made no move towards the desk.
The fingers of my right hand twitched and curled. I felt the beginnings of tension
in the muscles of my stomach. My eyes moved.
Kawahara's voice came through faintly. She must be in the other room, beyond
the arch. 'They coming?'
Trepp's face stayed impassive. Her eyes lifted from me. 'Yeah,' she said loudly.
'Be here in a couple of minutes.'
I was coming back. Something was forcing my nerves back into sparking,
fizzing life. I could feel the shakes setting in, and with them a soupy, suffocating
quality to the air in my lungs that meant the betathanatine crash was coming on
ahead of schedule. My limbs were moulded in lead and my hands felt as if I was
wearing thick cotton gloves with a low electric current fizzing through them. I
was in no condition for a fight.
My left hand was folded under me, flattened to the floor by the weight of my
body. My right trailed out at an awkward side angle. It didn't feel as if my legs
would do much more than hold me up. My options were limited.

'Right then.' I felt Kawahara's hand on my shoulder, pulling me onto my back
like a fish for gutting. Her face was masked in concentration and there was a pair
of needle-nosed pliers in her other hand. She knelt astride my chest and spread
the lids of my left eye with her fingers. I forced down the urge to blink, held
myself immobile. The pliers came down, jaws poised a half centimetre apart.
I tensed the muscles in my forearm, and the neural spring harness delivered the
Tebbit knife into my hand.
I slashed sideways.
I was aiming for Kawahara's side, below the floating ribs, but the combination of
stun shakes and betathanatine crash threw me off and the knife blade sliced into
her left arm below the elbow, jarred on the bone and bounced off. Kawahara
yelled and released her grip on my eye. The pliers plunged down, off course, hit
my cheekbone and carved a trough in the flesh of my cheek. I felt the pain
distantly, metal snagging tissue. Blood spilled down into my eye. I stabbed
again, weakly, but this time Kawahara twisted astride me and blocked downward
with her injured arm. She yelled again and my fizzing glove grip on the knife
slipped. The haft trickled away past my palm and the weapon was gone.
Summoning all my remaining energy into my left arm, I hooked a savage punch
up from the floor and caught Kawahara on the temple. She rolled off me,
clutching at the wound in her arm, and for a moment I thought the blade had
gone deep enough to mark her with the C-381 coating. But Sheila Sorenson had
told me that the cyanide poisoning would do its work in the time it takes to draw
a couple of breaths.
Kawahara was getting up.
'What the fuck are you waiting for?' she enquired acidly of Trepp. 'Shoot this
piece of shit, will you?'
Her voice died on the last word as she saw the truth in Trepp's face an instant
before the pale woman went for her holstered stungun. Maybe it was a truth that
was only dawning on Trepp herself at that moment, because she was slow.
Kawahara dropped the pliers, cleared both shard gun and stunner from her belt
with a snap and levelled them before Trepp's weapon was even halfway out: of
the holster.
'You traitorous fucking cunt,' Kawahara spat out wonderingly, her voice

suddenly streaked through with a coarse accent I had never heard before. 'You
knew he was coming round, didn't you? You're fucking dead, bitch.'
I staggered upright and lurched into Kawahara just as she pulled the triggers. I
heard both weapons discharge, the almost supra-aural whine of the shard gun
and the sharp electrical splatter of the stunner. Through the fogged vision in the
corner of one eye, I saw Trepp make a desperate bid to complete her draw and
not even come close. She went down, face almost comically surprised. At the
same time my shoulder smashed into Kawahara and we stumbled back towards
the slope of the windows. She tried to shoot me but I flailed the guns aside with
my arms and tripped her. She hooked at me with her injured arm and we both
went down on the angled glass.
The stunner was gone, skittering across the floor, but she'd managed to hang on
to the shard gun. It swung round at me and I batted it down clumsily. My other
hand punched at Kawahara's head, missed and bounced off her shoulder. She
grinned fiercely and headbutted me in the face. My nose broke with a sensation
like biting into celery and blood flooded down over my mouth. From somewhere
I suffered an insane desire to taste it. Then Kawahara was on me, twisting me
back against the glass and punching solidly into my body. I blocked one or two
of the punches, but the strength was puddling out of me and the muscles in my
arms were losing interest. Things started to go numb inside. Above me
Kawahara's face registered a savage triumph as she saw that the fight was over.
She hit me once more, with great care, in the groin. I convulsed and slid down
the glass into a sprawled heap on the floor.
'That ought to hold you, sport,' she grated, and jerked herself back to her feet,
breathing heavily. Beneath the barely disarrayed elegance of her hair, I suddenly
saw the face that this new accent belonged to. The brutal satisfaction in that face
was what her victims in Fission City must have seen as she made them drink
from the dull grey flask of the water carrier. 'You just lie there for a moment.'
My body told me that I didn't have any other option. I felt drenched in damage,
sinking fast under the weight of the chemicals silting up my system and the
shivering neural invasion of the stun bolt. I tried to lift one arm and it flopped
back down like a fish with a kilo of lead in its guts. Kawahara saw it happen and
grinned.
'Yeah, that'll do nicely,' she said and looked absently down at her own left arm,

where blood was trickling from the rent in her blouse. 'You're going to fucking
pay for that, Kovacs.'
She walked across to Trepp's motionless form. 'And you, you fuck,' she said,
kicking the pale woman hard in the ribs. The body did not move. 'What did this
motherfucker do for you, anyway? Promise to eat your cunt for the next decade?'
Trepp made no response. I strained the fingers of my left hand and managed to
move them a few centimetres across the floor towards my leg. Kawahara went to
the desk with a final backward glance at Trepp's body and touched a control.
'Security?'
'Ms Kawahara.' It was the same male voice that had grilled Ortega on our
approach to the airship. 'There's been an incursion on the — '
'I know what there's been,' said Kawahara tiredly. 'I've been wrestling with it for
the last five minutes. Why aren't you down here?'
'Ms Kawahara?'
'I said, how long does it take you to get your synthetic ass down here on a call
out?'
There was a brief silence. Kawahara waited, head bowed over the desk. I
reached across my body and my right and left hands met in a weak clasp, then
curled closed on what they held and fell back.
'Ms Kawahara, there was no alert from your cabin.'
'Oh.' Kawahara turned back to look at Trepp. 'OK, well get someone down here
now. Squad of four. There's some garbage to take out.'
'Yes, ma'am.'
In spite of everything, I felt a smile crawl onto my mouth. Ma'am?
Kawahara came back, scooping the pliers up off the floor on her way. 'What are
you grinning at, Kovacs?'

I tried to spit at her, but the saliva barely made it out of my mouth and hung in a
thick streamer over my jaw, mingled with the blood. Kawahara's face distorted
with sudden rage and she kicked me in the stomach. On top of everything else, I
barely felt it.
'You,' she began savagely, then forced the level of her voice back down to an
accentless icy calm, 'have caused more than enough trouble for one lifetime.'
She took hold of my collar and dragged me up the angled slope of the window
until we were at eye level. My head lolled back on the glass and she leaned over
me. Her tone eased back, almost to conversational.
'Like the Catholics, like your friends at Innenin, like the pointless motes of slum
life whose pathetic copulations brought you into existence, Takeshi. Human raw
material — that's all you've ever been. You could have evolved beyond it and
joined me on New Beijing, but you spat in my face and went back to your little
people existence. You could have joined us again, here on Earth, joined in the
steerage of the whole human race this time. You could have been a man of
power, Kovacs. Do you understand that? You could have been significant.'
'I don't think so,' I murmured weakly, starting to slide back down the glass. 'I've
still got a conscience rattling around in here somewhere. Just forgotten where I
put it.'
Kawahara grimaced and redoubled her hold on my collar. 'Very witty. Spirited.
You're going to need that, where you're going.'
'When they ask how I died,' I said, 'tell them: still angry.'
'Quell.' Kawahara leaned closer. She was almost lying on top of me now, like a
sated lover. 'But Quell never went into virtual interrogation, did she? You aren't
going to die angry, Kovacs. You're going to die pleading. Over. And over.
Again.'
She shifted her hold to my chest and pressed me down hard. The pliers came up.
'Have an aperitif.'
The jaws of the tool plunged into the underside of my eye and a spurt of blood
sprinkled Kawahara's face. Pain flared brightly. For a moment, I could see the

pliers through the eye they were embedded in, towering away like a massive
steel pylon, and then Kawahara twisted the jaws and something burst. My vision
splashed red and then winked out, a dying monitor screen like the ones at
Elliott's Data Linkage. From my other eye I saw Kawahara withdraw the pliers
with Reese's recording wire gripped in the jaws. The rear end of the tiny device
dripped minute spots of gore onto my cheek.
She'd go after Elliott and Reese. Not to mention Ortega, Bautista and who knew
how many others.
'That's fucking enough,' I muttered in a slurred tone, and at the same moment,
driving the muscles in my thighs to work, I locked my legs around Kawahara's
waist. My left hand slapped down flat on the sloping glass.
The muffled crump of an explosion, and a sharp cracking.
Dialled to the short end of its fuse option, the termite microgrenade was
designed to detonate almost instantaneously and to deliver ninety per cent of its
charge to the contact face. The remaining ten per cent still wrecked my hand,
tearing the flesh from the Khumalo marrow alloy bones and carbon-reinforced
tendons, ripping the poly-bond ligamenting apart and punching a coin-sized hole
in my palm.
On the downward side, the window shattered like a thick plate of river ice. It
seemed to happen in slow motion. I felt the surface cave in beside me and then I
was sliding sideways into the gap. Vaguely, I registered the rush of cold air into
the cabin. Above me, Kawahara's face had gone stupid with shock as she
realised what had happened, but she was too late. She came with me, flailing and
smashing at my head and chest, but unable to break the lock I had on her waist.
The pliers rose and fell, peeling a long strip of flesh from one cheekbone,
plunging once into my wrecked eye, but by now the pain was far away, almost
irrelevant, consumed entire by a bonfire of rage that had finally broken through
what was left of the betathanatine.
Tell them: still angry.
Then the portion of glass we were struggling on gave way and tipped us out into
the wind and sky.
And we fell . . .

My left arm was paralysed in position by some damage the explosion had done,
but as we started to tumble down through the chilled darkness I brought my right
hand around and cupped the other grenade against the base of Kawahara's skull.
I had a confused glimpse of the ocean far below, Head in the Clouds rocketing
upwards away from us and an expression on Reileen Kawahara's face that had
left sanity as far behind as the airship. Something was screaming, but I no longer
knew if the sound came from within or without. Perception was spiralling away
from me in the shrill whistling of the air around us, and I could no longer find
my way back to the little window of individual viewpoint. The fall was as
seductive as sleep.
With what remained of my will, I clamped grenade and skull against my own
chest, hard enough to detonate.
My last thought was the hope that Davidson was watching his screen.

CHAPTER FORTY-TWO

The address was, ironically enough, down in Licktown. I left the autocab two
blocks north and walked the rest of the way, unable to quite shake an eerie
feeling of synthesis, as if the machinery of the cosmos were suddenly poking
through the fabric of reality for me to see.
The apartment I was looking for formed part of a U-shaped block with a cracked
and weed-grown concrete landing area in the centre. Amongst the array of sadlooking ground and flight vehicles, I spotted the microcopter immediately.
Someone had given it a purple and red-trim paint job recently, and though it still
listed wearily to one side on its pods there were shiny clusters of expensivelooking sensor equipment fitted to the nose and tail. I nodded to myself and went
up a flight of external steps to the second floor of the block.
The door to number seventeen was opened by an eleven-year-old boy who stared
at me with blank hostility.
'Yeah?'
'I'd like to speak to Sheryl Bostock.'
'Yeah, well she ain't here.'
I sighed and rubbed at the scar under my eye. 'I think that's probably not true.
Her copter's in the yard, you're her son, Daryl, and she came off night shift about
three hours ago. Will you tell her there's someone to see her about the Bancroft
sleeve.'

'You the Sia?'
'No, I just want to talk. If she can help me, there might be some money in it for
her.'
The boy stared at me for another pair of seconds, then closed the door without a
word. From inside, I heard him calling his mother. I waited, and fought the urge
to smoke.
Five minutes later Sheryl Bostock appeared around the edge of the door, dressed
in a loose kaftan. Her synthetic sleeve was even more expressionless than her
son had been, but it was a slack-muscled blankness that had nothing to do with
attitude. Small muscle groups take a while to warm up from sleep on the cheaper
model synthetics, and this was definitely a model from the cut-price end of the
market.
'You want to see me?' the synth voice asked unevenly. 'What for?'
'I'm a private investigator working for Laurens Bancroft,' I said as gently as I
could. 'I'd like to ask you a few questions about your duties at PsychaSec. May I
come in?'
She made a small noise, one that made me think she'd probably tried to shut
doors in men's faces before without success.
'It won't take long.'
She shrugged, and opened the door wide. I passed her and stepped into a tidily
kept but threadbare room whose most important feature was clearly a sleek black
entertainment deck. The system reared off the carpeting in the far corner like an
obscure machine-god's idol, and the remaining furniture had been rearranged
around it in obeisance. Like the microcopter's paint job, it looked new.
Daryl had disappeared from view.
'Nice deck,' I said, going over to examine the machine's raked display front.
'When did you get it?'
'A while ago.' Sheryl Bostock closed the door and came to stand uncertainly in
the centre of the room. Her face was waking up and now its expression hovered

midway between sleep and suspicion. 'What do you want to ask me?'
'May I sit down?'
She motioned me wordlessly to one of the brutally used armchairs and seated
herself opposite me on a lounger. In the gaps left by the kaftan, her synthetic
flesh looked pinkish and unreal. I looked at her for a while, wondering if I
wanted to go through with this after all.
'Well?' She jerked her hand at me nervously. 'What do you want to ask me? You
wake me up after the night shift, you'd better have a good goddamn reason for
this.'
'On Tuesday 14th August you went into the Bancroft family's sleeving chamber
and injected a Laurens Bancroft clone with a full hypospray of something. I'd
like to know what it was, Sheryl.'
The result was more dramatic than I would have imagined possible. Sheryl
Bostock's artificial features flinched violently and she recoiled as if I'd
threatened her with a riot prod.
'That's a part of my usual duties,' she cried shrilly. 'I'm authorised to perform
chemical input on the clones.'
It didn't sound like her speaking. It sounded like something someone had told her
to memorise.
'Was it synamorphesterone?' I asked quietly.
Cheap synths don't blush or go pale, but the look on her face conveyed the
message just as effectively. She looked like a frightened animal, betrayed by its
owner.
'How do you know that? Who told you that?' Her voice scaled to a high sobbing.
'You can't know that. She said no one would know.'
She collapsed onto the sofa, weeping into her hands. Daryl emerged from
another room at the sound of his mother crying, hesitated in the doorway, and
evidently deciding that he couldn't or shouldn't do anything, stayed there,
watching me with a frightened expression on his face. I compressed a sigh and

nodded at him, trying to look as unthreatening as possible. He went cautiously to
the sofa and put a hand on his mother's shoulder, making her start as if from a
blow. Ripples of memory stirred in me and I could feel my own expression
turning cold and grim. I tried to smile across the room at them, but it was
farcical.
I cleared my throat. 'I'm not here to do anything to you,' I said. 'I just want to
know.'
It took a minute or so for the words to get through the cobwebby veils of terror
and sink into Sheryl Bostock's consciousness. It took even longer for her to get
her tears under control and look up at me. Beside her, Daryl stroked her head
doubtfully. I gritted my teeth and tried to stop the memories of my own eleventh
year welling up in my head. I waited.
'It was her,' she said, finally.

Curtis intercepted me as I came round the seaward wing of Suntouch House. His
face was darkened with anger and his hands were curled into fists at his sides.
'She doesn't want to talk to you,' he snarled at me.
'Get out of my way, Curtis,' I said evenly. 'Or you're going to get hurt.'
His arms snapped up into a karate guard. 'I said, she does — '
At that point I kicked him in the knee and he collapsed at my feet. A second kick
rolled him a couple of metres down the slope towards the tennis courts. By the
time he came out of the roll, I was on him. I jammed a knee into the small of his
back and pulled his head up by the hair.
'I'm not having a great day,' I told him patiently. 'And you're making it worse.
Now, I'm going up there to talk to your boss. It'll take about ten minutes, and
then I'll be gone. If you're wise, you'll stay out of the way.'
'You fuck — '
I pulled his hair harder and he yelped. 'If you come in there after me, Curtis, I'm

going to hurt you. Badly. Do you understand? I'm not in the mood for
swampsuck grifters like you today.'
'Leave him alone, Mr Kovacs. Weren't you ever nineteen?'
I glanced over my shoulder to where Miriam Bancroft stood with her hands in
the pockets of a loose, desert-coloured ensemble apparently modelled on
Sharyan harem-wear. Her long hair was caught up under a swathe of the ochre
cloth and her eyes glinted in the sun. I remembered suddenly what Ortega had
said about Naka-mura. They use her face and body to sell the stuff. Now I could
see it, the casual poise of a fashion-house sleeve demonstrator.
I let go of Curtis's hair and stood back while he climbed to his feet. 'I wasn't this
stupid at any age,' I said untruthfully. 'Do you want to tell him to back off,
instead? Maybe he'll listen to you.'
'Curtis, go and wait for me in the limousine. I won't be long.'
'Are you going to let him — '
'Curtis!' There was a cordial astonishment in her tone, as if there must be some
mistake, as if answering back just wasn't on the menu. Curtis's face flushed when
he heard it, and he stalked away from us with tears of consternation standing in
his eyes. I watched him out of sight, still not convinced I shouldn't have hit him
again. Miriam Bancroft must have read the thought on my face.
'I would have thought even your appetite for violence had been sated by now,'
she said quietly. 'Are you still looking for targets?'
'Who says I'm looking for targets?'
'You did.'
I looked quickly at her. 'I don't remember that.'
'How convenient.'
'No, you don't understand.' I lifted my open hands towards her. 'I don't remember
it. Everything we did together is gone. I don't have those memories. It's been
wiped.'

She flinched as if I'd struck her.
'But you,' she said in pieces. 'I thought. You look — '
'The same.' I looked down at myself, at Ryker's sleeve. 'Well, there wasn't much
left of the other sleeve when they fished me out of the sea. This was the only
option. And the UN investigators point-blank refused to allow another double
sleeving. Don't blame them, really. It's going to be hard enough to justify the one
we did as it is.'
'But how did you — '
'Decide?' I smiled without much enthusiasm. 'Shall we go inside and talk about
this?'
I let her lead me back up to the conservatory, where someone had set out a jug
and tall-stemmed glasses on the ornamental table beneath the martyrweed
stands. The jug was filled with a liquid the colour of sunsets. We took seats
opposite each other without exchanging words or glances. She poured herself a
glass without offering me one, a tiny casualness that spoke volumes about what
had happened between Miriam Bancroft and my other self.
'I'm afraid I don't have much time,' she said absently. 'As I told you on the phone,
Laurens has asked me to come to New York immediately. I was actually on my
way out when you called.'
I said nothing, waiting, and when she had finished pouring I got my own glass.
The move felt bone-deep wrong, and my awkwardness must have shown. She
started with realisation.
'Oh, I — '
'Forget it.' I settled back into my seat and sipped at the drink. It had a faint bite
beneath the mellowness. 'You wanted to know how we decided? We gambled.
Paper, scissors, stone. Of course, we talked around it for hours first. They had us
in a virtual forum over in New York, very high ratio, discretion-shielded while
we made up our minds. No expense spared for the heroes of the hour.'
I found an edge of bitterness creeping into my voice, and I had to stop to dump
it. I took a longer pull at my drink.

'Like I said, we talked. A lot. We thought of a lot of different ways to decide,
some of them were maybe even viable, but in the end we kept coming back to it.
Scissors, paper, stone. Best of five. Why not?'
I shrugged, but it was not the casual gesture I hoped it would appear. I was still
trying to shake off the cold that crept through me whenever I thought about that
game, trying to second-guess myself with my own existence at stake. The best of
five, and it had gone to two all, My heart was beating like the junk rhythm in
Jerry's Closed Quarters, and I was dizzy with adrenalin. Even facing Kawahara
hadn't been this hard.
When he lost the last round — stone to my paper — we both stared at our two
extended hands for what seemed like a long time. Then, he'd got up with a faint
smile and cocked his thumb and forefinger at his own head, somewhere midway
between a salute and a burlesque of suicide.
'Anything I should tell Jimmy when I see him?'
I shook my head wordlessly.
'Well, have a nice life,' he said, and left the sunlit room, closing the door gently
behind him. Part of me was still screaming inside that he had somehow thrown
the last game.
They re-sleeved me the next day.
I looked up again. 'Now I guess you're wondering why I bothered coming here.'
'Yes, I am.'
'It concerns Sheryl Bostock,' I said.
'Who?'
I sighed. 'Miriam, please. Don't make this any tougher than it already is. Sheryl
Bostock is shit-scared you're going to have her torched because of what she
knows. I've come here to have you convince me she's wrong, because that's what
I promised her.'
Miriam Bancroft looked at me for a moment, eyes widening, and then,

convulsively, she threw her drink in my face.
'You arrogant little man,' she hissed. 'How dare you? How dare you?'
I wiped drink out of my eyes and stared at her. I'd expected a reaction but it
wasn't this. I raked surplus cocktail from my hair.
'Excuse me?'
'How dare you walk in here, telling me this is difficult for you? Do you have any
idea what my husband is going through at this moment?'
'Well, let's see.' I wiped my hands clean on my shirt, frowning. 'Right now he's
the five-star guest of a UN Special Inquiry in New York. What do you reckon,
the marital separation's getting to him? Can't be that hard to find a whorehouse
in New York.'
Miriam Bancroft's jaw clenched.
'You are cruel,' she whispered.
'And you're dangerous.' I felt a little steam wisping off the surface of my own
control. 'I'm not the one who kicked an unborn child to death in San Diego. I'm
not the one who dosed her own husband's clone with synamorphesterone while
he was away in Osaka, knowing full well what he'd do to the first woman he
fucked in that state. Knowing that woman wouldn't be you, of course. It's no
wonder Sheryl Bostock's terrified. Just looking at you, I'm wondering whether
I'll live past the front gates.'
'Stop it.' She drew a deep, shuddering breath. 'Stop it. Please.'
I stopped. We both sat in silence, she with her head bowed.
'Tell me what happened,' I said finally. 'I got most of it from Kawahara. I know
why Laurens torched himself — '
'Do you?' Her voice was quiet now, but there were still traces of her previous
venom in the question. 'Tell me, what do you know? That he killed himself to
escape blackmail. That's what they're saying in New York, isn't it?'

'It's a reasonable assumption, Miriam,' I said quietly. 'Kawahara had him in a
lock. Vote down Resolution 653 or face exposure as a murderer. Killing himself
before the needlecast went through to Psychasec was the only way out of it. If he
hadn't been so bloody-minded about the suicide verdict, he might have got away
with it.'
'Yes. If you hadn't come.'
I made a gesture that felt unfairly defensive. 'It wasn't my idea.'
'And what about guilt?' she said into the quiet. 'Did you stop to consider that?
Did you stop to think how Laurens must have felt when he realised what he'd
done, when they told him that girl Rentang was a Catholic, a girl who could
never have her life back, even if Resolution 653 did force her back into
temporary existence to testify against him? Don't you think when he put the gun
against his own throat and pulled the trigger, that he was punishing himself for
what he'd done? Did you ever consider that maybe he was not trying to get away
with it, as you put it?'
I thought about Bancroft, turning the idea over in my mind, and it wasn't entirely
difficult to say what Miriam Bancroft wanted to hear.
'It's a possibility,' I said.
She choked a laugh. 'It's more than a possibility, Mr Kovacs. You forget, I was
here that night. I watched him from the stairs when he came in. I saw his face. I
saw the pain on his face. He paid for what he'd done. He judged and executed
himself for it. He paid, he destroyed the man who committed the crime, and now
a man who has no memory of that crime, a man who did not commit that crime,
is living with the guilt again. Are you satisfied, Mr Kovacs?'
The bitter echoes of her voice were leached out of the room by the martyrweed.
The silence thickened.
'Why'd you do it?' I asked, when she showed no sign of speaking again. 'Why
did Maria Rentang have to pay for your husband's infidelities?'
She looked at me as if I had asked her for some major spiritual truth and shook
her head helplessly.

'It was the only way I could think of to hurt him,' she murmured.
No different to Kawahara in the end, I thought: with carefully manufactured
savagery. Just another Mieth, moving the little people around like pieces in a
puzzle.
'Did you know Curtis was working for Kawahara?' I asked tonelessly.
'I guessed. Afterwards.' She lifted a hand. 'But I had no way of proving it. How
did you work it out?'
'Retrospectively. He took me to the Hendrix, recommended it to me. Kadmin
turned up five minutes after I went in, on Kawahara's orders. That's too close for
a coincidence.'
'Yes,' she said distantly. 'It fits.'
'Curtis got the synamorphesterone for you?'
She nodded.
'Through Kawahara, I imagine. A liberal supply as well. He was dosed to the
eyes the night you sent him to see me. Did he suggest spiking the clone before
the Osaka trip?'
'No. That was Kawahara.' Miriam Bancroft cleared her throat. 'We had an
unusually candid conversation a few days before. Looking back, she must have
been engineering the whole thing around Osaka.'
'Yeah, Reileen's pretty thorough. Was pretty thorough. She would have known
there was an even chance Laurens would refuse to back her. So you bribed
Sheryl Bostock with a visit to the island funhouse, just like me. Only instead of
getting to play with the glorious Miriam Bancroft body like me, she got to wear
it. A handful of cash, and the promise she could come back and play again some
day. Poor cow, she was in paradise for thirty-six hours and now she's like a
junkie in withdrawal. Were you ever going to take her back there?'
'I am a woman of my word.'
'Yeah? Well, as a favour to me, do it soon.'

'And the rest? You have evidence? You intend to tell Laurens about my part in
this?'
I reached into my pocket and produced a matt black disc. 'Footage of the
injection,' I said, holding it up. 'Composite footage of Sheryl Bostock leaving
PsychaSec and flying to a meeting with your limousine, which subsequently
heads out to sea. Without this, there's nothing to say your husband didn't kill
Maria Rentang chemically unassisted, but they're probably going to assume
Kawahara dosed him aboard Head in the Clouds. There's no evidence, but it's
expedient.'
'How did you know?' She was looking into a corner of the conservatory, voice
small and distant. 'How did you get to Bostock?'
'Intuition, mostly. You saw me looking through the telescope?'
She nodded and cleared her throat. 'I thought you were playing with me. I
thought you'd told him.'
'No.' I felt a faint stab of anger. 'Kawahara was still holding my friend in virtual.
And threatening to torture her into insanity.'
She looked sideways at me, then looked away. 'I didn't know that,' she said
quietly.
'Yeah, well.' I shrugged. 'The telescope gave me half of it. Your husband aboard
Head in the Clouds just before he killed himself. So then I started thinking about
all the unpleasant stuff Kawahara had to play with up there, and I wondered if
your husband could have been induced to kill himself. Chemically, or through
some kind of virtual programme. I've seen it done before.'
'Yes. I'm sure you have.' She sounded tired now, drifting away. 'So why look for
it at PsychaSec and not Head in the Clouds?'
'I'm not sure. Intuition, like I said. Maybe because chemical mugging aboard an
aerial whorehouse just didn't seem like Kawahara's style. Too headlong, too
crude. She's a chess player, not a brawler. Was. Or maybe just because I had no
way to get into the Head in the Clouds surveillance stack the way I could with
PsychaSec, and I wanted to do something immediate. In any case, I told the
Hendrix to go in and survey standard medical procedures for the clones, then

backtrack for any irregularities. That gave me Sheryl Bostock.'
'How very astute.' She turned to look at me. 'And what now, Mr Kovacs? More
justice? More crucifixion of the Meths?'
I tossed the disc onto the table.
'I had the Hendrix go in and erase the injection footage from PsychaSec's files.
Like I said, they'll probably assume your husband was dosed aboard Head in the
Clouds. The expedient solution. Oh, and we erased the Hendrix's memory of
your visit to my room too, just in case someone wanted to make something of
what you said about buying me off. One way and another, I'd say you owe the
Hendrix a couple of big favours. It said a few guests every now and then would
do. Shouldn't cost much, relatively speaking. I sort of promised on your behalf.'
I didn't tell her about Ortega's sight of the bedroom scene, or how long it had
taken to talk the policewoman round. I still wasn't sure why she'd agreed myself.
Instead I watched the wonder on Miriam Bancroft's face for the full half minute
it took her to reach out and close her hand around the disc. She looked up at me
over her clenched fingers as she took it.
'Why?'
'I don't know,' I said morosely. 'Who knows, maybe you and Laurens deserve
each other. Maybe you deserve to go on loving a faithless sexual maladjust who
can't deal with respect and appetite in the same relationship. Maybe he deserves
to go on not knowing whether he murdered Rentang unprovoked or not. Maybe
you're just like Reileen, both of you. Maybe all you Meths deserve is each other.
All I know is, the rest of us don't deserve you.'
I got up to go.
'Thanks for the drink.'
I got as far as the door — '
'Takeshi.'
' — and turned back, unwillingly, to face her.

'That isn't it,' she said with certainty. 'Maybe you believe all those things, but that
isn't it. Is it?'
I shook my head. 'No, that isn't it,' I agreed.
'Then why?'
'Like I said, I don't know why.' I stared at her, wondering if I was glad I couldn't
remember or not. My voice softened. 'But he asked me to do it, if I won. It was
part of the deal. He didn't tell me why.'
I left her sitting alone amidst the martyrweed.

EPILOGUE

The tide was out at Ember, leaving a wet expanse of sand that stretched almost to
the listing wreck of the Free Trade Enforcer. The rocks that the carrier had
gashed herself on were exposed, gathered in shallow water at the bow like a
fossilised outpouring of the ship's guts. Seabirds were perched there, screaming
shrilly at each other. A thin wind came in across the sand and made minute
ripples in the puddles left by our footprints. Up on the promenade, Anchana
Salomao's face had been taken down, intensifying the bleak emptiness of the
street.
'I thought you'd have gone,' said Irene Elliott beside me.
'It's in the pipe. Harlan's World are dragging out the needlecast authorisation.
They really don't want me back.'
'And no one wants you here.'
I shrugged. 'It's not a new situation for me.'
We walked on in silence for a while. It was a peculiar feeling, talking to Irene
Elliott in her own body. In the days leading up to the Head in the Clouds gig, I'd
become accustomed to looking down to her face, but this big-boned blonde
sleeve was almost as tall as me, and there was an aura of gaunt competence
about her that had only come through faintly in her mannerisms in the other
body.

'I've been offered a job,' she said at length. 'Security consulting for Mainline
d.h.f. You heard of them?'
I shook my head.
'Quite high profile on the East Coast. They must have their headhunters on the
inquiry board or something. Soon as the UN cleared me, they were knocking on
the door. Exploding offer, five grand if I signed there and then.'
'Yeah, standard practice. Congratulations. You moving east, or are they going to
wire the job through to you here?'
'Probably do it here, at least for a while. We've got Elizabeth in a virtual condo
down in Bay City, and it's a lot cheaper to wire in locally. The start-up cost us
most of that five grand, and we figure it'll be a few years before we can afford to
re-sleeve her.' She turned a shy smile towards me. 'We spend most of our time
there at the moment. That's where Victor went today.'
'You don't need to make excuses for him,' I said gently. 'I didn't figure he'd want
to talk to me anyway.'
She looked away. 'It's, you know, he was always so proud and — '
'Forget it. Someone walked all over my feelings the way I did over his, I
wouldn't feel like talking to them either.' I stopped and reached in my pocket.
'Reminds me. I brought something for you.'
She looked down at the anonymous grey credit chip in my hand.
'What's this?'
'About eighty thousand,' I said. 'I figure with that you can afford something
custom-grown for Elizabeth. If she chooses quick, you could have her sleeved
before the end of the year.'
'What?' She stared at me with a smile slipping off and on her face, like someone
who has been told a joke she's not sure she understands. 'You're giving us —
Why? Why are you doing this?'
This time I had an answer. I'd been thinking about it all the way up from Bay

City that morning. I took Irene Elliott's hand and pressed the chip into it.
'Because I want there to be something clean at the end of all this,' I said quietly.
'Something I can feel good about.'
For a moment she went on staring at me. Then she closed the small gap between
us and flung her arms around me with a cry that sent the nearest gulls wheeling
up off the sand in alarm. I felt a trickle of tears smeared onto the side of my face,
but she was laughing at the same time. I folded my arms round her in return and
held her.
And for the moments that the embrace lasted, and a little while after, I felt as
clean as the breeze coming in off the sea.
You take what is offered, said Virginia Vidaura, somewhere. And that must
sometimes be enough.

It took them another eleven days to authorise the needlecast returning me to
Harlan's World, most of which I spent hanging around the Hendrix watching the
news and feeling oddly guilty about my impending checkout. There were very
few actual facts publicly available about the demise of Reileen Kawahara, so the
resulting coverage was lurid, sensational and largely inaccurate. The UN Special
Inquiry remained veiled in secrecy, and when the rumours about the forthcoming
adoption of Resolution 653 finally broke there was little to connect them to what
had gone before. Bancroft's name never appeared, and nor did mine.
I never spoke to Bancroft again. The rieedlecast authorisation and re-sleeving
bond for Harlan's World were delivered to me by Oumou Prescott who, though
she was pleasant enough and assured me that the terms of my contract would be
honoured to the letter, also conveyed a smoothly menacing message that I was
not to attempt any further communication with any member of the Bancroft
family ever again. The reason cited by Prescott was my deceit over the Jack It
Up story, the breach of my much-vaunted word, but I knew better. I'd seen it in
Bancroft's face across the inquiry chamber when the facts about Miriam's
whereabouts and activities during the assault on Head in the Clouds came out.
Despite all his urbane Meth bullshit, the old bastard was stabbed through with
jealousy. I wondered what he would have done if he'd had to sit through the
deleted Hendrix bedroom files.

Ortega rode with me to Bay City Central the day of the needlecast, the same day
that Mary Lou Hinchley was downloaded into a witness stand synthetic for the
opening hearing on Head in the Clouds. There were chanting crowds on the steps
up to the entrance hall, faced off against a line of grim-looking black-uniformed
UN Public Order police. The same crude holographic placards that I
remembered from my arrival on Earth bobbed about over our heads as we forced
our way through the press. The sky above was an ominous grey.
'Fucking clowns,' growled Ortega, elbowing the last of the demonstrators out of
her way. 'If they provoke the Pubs, they'll be sorry. I've seen these boys in action
before and it isn't pretty.'
I ducked around a shaven-headed young man who was punching violently at the
sky with one fist and holding one of the placard generators with the other. His
voice was hoarse and he appeared to be working himself into a frenzied trance. I
joined Ortega at the upper fringe of the crowd, a little out of breath.
'There isn't enough organisation here to be a real threat,' I said, raising my voice
to compete with the crowd. 'They're just making a noise.'
'Yeah, well that never stopped the Pubs before. They're likely to break a few
skulls just on general principles. What a fucking mess.'
'Price of progress, Kristin. You wanted Resolution 653.' I gestured at the sea of
angry faces below. 'Now you've got it.'
One of the masked and padded men above us broke ranks and came down the
steps, riot prod fractionally lifted at his side. His jacket bore a sergeant's crimson
slash at the shoulder. Ortega flipped her badge at him and after a brief, shouted
conversation, we were allowed up. The line parted for us and then the double
doors into the hall beyond. It was hard to tell which was the most smoothly
mechanical, the doors or the black-clad faceless figures that stood guard over
them.
Inside, it was quiet and gloomy with the storm light coming through the roof
panels. I looked around at the deserted benches and sighed. Whatever world it is,
whatever you've done there for better or worse, you always leave the same way.
Alone.

'You need a minute?'
I shook my head. 'Need a lifetime, Kristin. Maybe then some.'
'Stay out of trouble, maybe you'll get it.' There was an attempt at humour
floating in her voice, rather like a corpse in a swimming pool, and she must have
realised how it sounded because the sentence was bitten off. An awkwardness
was growing between us, something that had started as soon as they re-sleeved
me in Ryker's body for the real-time committee hearings. During the inquiry
we'd been kept too busy to see much of each other and when the proceedings
finally closed and we all went home, the pattern had endured. There'd been a few
gusty if only superficially satisfying couplings, but even these had stopped once
it became clear that Ryker would be cleared and released. Whatever shared
warmth we'd been gathered in to was out of control now, unsafe, like the flames
from a smashed storm lantern, and trying to hold onto it was only getting us both
painfully scorched.
I turned and gave her a faint smile. 'Stay out of trouble, huh? That what you told
Trepp?'
It was an unkind blow, and I knew it. Against all the odds, it seemed Kawahara
had missed Trepp with everything but the edge of the stun beam. The shard gun,
I remembered when they told me, had been dialled down to minimum dispersal
just before I went in to face Kawahara. Sheer luck I'd left it that way. By the time
the rapidly summoned UN forensics team arrived on Head in the Clouds to take
evidence under Ortega's direction, Trepp had vanished, as had my grav harness
from the atmosphere sampling turret where I'd come aboard. I didn't know
whether Ortega and Bautista had seen fit to let the mercenary go in view of the
testimony she could give concerning the Panama Rose, or if Trepp had simply
staggered off stage before the police got: there. Ortega had volunteered no
information and there wasn't enough left of our previous intimacy for me to ask
her outright. This was the first time we'd discussed it openly.
Ortega scowled at me. 'You asking me to equate the two of you?'
'Not asking you to do anything, Kristin.' I shrugged. 'But for what it's worth, I
don't see a lot of ground between her and me.'
'Go on thinking like that, nothing'll ever change for you.'

'Kristin, nothing ever does change.' I jerked a thumb back at the crowd outside.
'You'll always have morons like that, swallowing belief patterns whole so they
don't have to think for themselves. You'll always have people like Kawahara and
the Bancrofts to push their buttons and cash in on the program. People like you
to make sure the game runs smoothly and the rules don't get broken too often.
And when the Meths want to break the rules themselves, they'll send people like
Trepp and me to do it. That's the truth, Kristin. It's been the truth since I was
born a hundred and fifty years ago and from what I read in the history books, it's
never been any different. Better get used to it.'
She looked at me levelly for a moment, then nodded as if coming to an internal
decision. 'You always meant to kill Kawahara, didn't you? This confession
bullshit was just to get me along for the ride.'
It was a question I'd asked myself a lot, and I still didn't have a clear answer. I
shrugged again.
'She deserved to die, Kristin. To really die. That's all I know for certain.'
Over my head, a faint pattering sounded from the roof panels. I tipped my head
back and saw transparent explosions on the glass. It was starting to rain.
'Got to go,' I said quietly. 'Next time you see this face, it won't be me wearing it,
so if there's anything you want to say . . . '
Ortega's face flinched almost imperceptibly as I said it. I cursed myself for the
awkwardness and tried to take her hand.
'Look, if it makes it any easier, no one knows. Bautista probably suspects we got
it together, but no one really knows.'
'I know,' she said sharply, not giving me her hand. 'I remember.'
I sighed. 'Yeah, so do I. It's worth remembering, Kristin. But don't let it fuck up
the rest of your life. Go get Ryker back, and get on to the next screen. That's
what counts. Oh yeah.' I reached into my coat and extracted a crumpled cigarette
packet. 'And you can have these back. I don't need them any more, and nor does
he, so don't start him off again. You owe me that much, at least. Just make sure
he stays quit.'

She blinked and kissed me abruptly, somewhere between mouth and cheek. It
was an inaccuracy I didn't try to correct either way. I turned away before I could
see if there were going to be any tears and started for the doors at the far end of
the hall. I looked back once, as I was mounting the steps. Ortega was still
standing there, arms wrapped around herself, watching me leave. In the
stormlight, it was too far away to see her face clearly.
For a moment something ached in me, something so deep-rooted that I knew to
tear it out would be to undo the essence of what held me together. The feeling
rose and splashed like the rain behind my eyes, swelling as the drumming on the
roof panels grew and the glass ran with water.
Then I had it locked down.
I turned back to the next step, found a chuckle somewhere in my chest and
coughed it out. The chuckle fired up and became a laugh of sorts.
Get to the next screen.
The doors were waiting at the top, the needlecast beyond.
Still trying to laugh, I went through.




PART I
It was a pleasure to burn.
It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things
blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this
great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood
pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing
conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring
down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic
helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame
with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the
house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and
yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above
all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace,
while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and

1

lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and
blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.
Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back
by flame.
He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at
himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to
sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in
the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as
long as he remembered.
He hung up his black-beetle-colored helmet and shined it, he hung
his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then,
whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire
station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster
seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his
fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels
one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.
He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street
toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid
soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a
great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the
suburb.
Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He
walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in
particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a
wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.
The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about
the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight
toward his house. He had felt that a moment prior to

2

his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged
with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a
moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him
through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on
the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one
spot where a person's standing might raise the immediate atmosphere
ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he
made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with
perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn
before he could focus his eyes or speak.
But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind,
reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper.
Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone
standing very quietly there, waiting?
He turned the corner.
The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way
as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk,
letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her
head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face
was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that
touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of
pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move
escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost
thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the
infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she
discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the
middle of the pavement waiting.
The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry
rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in

3

surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and
shining and alive, that he felt he had said something quite wonderful.
But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when
she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenixdisc on his chest, he spoke again.
"Of course," he said, "you're a new neighbor, aren't you?"
"And you must be"-she raised her eyes from his professional
symbols-"the fireman." Her voice trailed off.
"How oddly you say that."
"I'd-I'd have known it with my eyes shut," she said, slowly.
"What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains," he
laughed. "You never wash it off completely."
"No, you don't," she said, in awe.
He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for
end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once
moving herself.
"Kerosene," he said, because the silence had lengthened, "is
nothing but perfume to me."
"Does it seem like that, really?"
"Of course. Why not?"
She gave herself time to think of it. "I don't know." She turned to
face the sidewalk going toward their homes. "Do you mind if I walk
back with you? I'm Clarisse McClellan."
"Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so
late wandering around? How old are you?"
They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered
pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and
strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was
quite impossible, so late in the year.
There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as
snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working

4

his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.
"Well," she said, "I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the
two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say
seventeen and insane. Isn't this a nice time of night to walk? I like to
smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night,
walking, and watch the sun rise."
They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully,
"You know, I'm not afraid of you at all."
He was surprised. "Why should you be?"
"So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But you're just a
man, after all..."
He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of
bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his
mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of
violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned
to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it.
It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely
comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time,
when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a
last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such
illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably
around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping
that the power might not come on again too soon ....
And then Clarisse McClellan said:
"Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked at being a
fireman?"
"Since I was twenty, ten years ago."
"Do you ever read any of the books you bum?"
He laughed. "That's against the law!"

5

"Oh. Of course."
"It's fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday
Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then bum the ashes. That's our official
slogan."
They walked still further and the girl said, "Is it true that long ago
firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?"
"No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it."
"Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by
accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames."
He laughed.
She glanced quickly over. "Why are you laughing?"
"I don't know." He started to laugh again and stopped "Why?"
"You laugh when I haven't been funny and you answer right off.
You never stop to think what I've asked you."
He stopped walking, "You are an odd one," he said, looking at her.
"Haven't you any respect?"
"I don't mean to be insulting. It's just, I love to watch people too
much, I guess."
"Well, doesn't this mean anything to you?" He tapped the
numerals 451 stitched on his char-colored sleeve.
"Yes," she whispered. She increased her pace. "Have you ever
watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?
"You're changing the subject!"
"I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers,
because they never see them slowly," she said. "If you showed a driver
a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur? That's a rosegarden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove
slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed
him for two days. Isn't that funny, and sad, too?"
"You think too many things," said Montag, uneasily.

6

"I rarely watch the 'parlor walls' or go to races or Fun Parks. So I've
lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the twohundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you
know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started
rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it
would last."
"I didn't know that!" Montag laughed abruptly.
"Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in
the morning."
He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and
it made him quite irritable.
"And if you look"-she nodded at the sky-"there's a man in the
moon."
He hadn't looked for a long time.
They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a
kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her
accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were
blazing.
"What's going on?" Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.
"Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking.
It's like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another
time-did I tell you?-for being a pedestrian. Oh, we're most peculiar."
"But what do you talk about?"
She laughed at this. "Good night!" She started up her walk. Then
she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with
wonder and curiosity. "Are you happy?" she said.
"Am I what?" he cried.
But she was gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut
gently.

7

***
"Happy! Of all the nonsense."
He stopped laughing.
He put his hand into the glove-hole of his front door and let it
know his touch. The front door slid open.
Of course I'm happy. What does she think? I'm not? he asked the
quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and
suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille,
something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes
quickly away.
What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered
nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old
man in the park and they had talked ....
Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girl's face
was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She
had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark
room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see
the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a
white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to
tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but
moving also toward a new sun.
"What?" asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot
that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and
conscience.
He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face.
Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your
own light to you? People were more often-he searched for a simile,
found one in his work-torches, blazing away until they whiffed out.
How rarely did other people's faces take of you and throw back to you
your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?

8

What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like
the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an
eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment
before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes?
Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she
was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with
her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if
the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long
before he would.
Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be
waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night ... .
He opened the bedroom door.
It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum
after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver
world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world
where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not
empty.
He listened.
The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical
murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The
music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.
He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself
like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long
and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy.
He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as
the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl
had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of
going to knock on her door and ask for it back.

9

Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would
look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body
displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible
threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the
thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music
and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her
unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves
came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her,
wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two
years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down
in it for the third time.
The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe.
He did not wish to open the curtains and open the French windows, for
he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling of
a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air, he felt his way
toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed.
An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he
would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had
experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl
down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the
small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked.
The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.
He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed
in the completely featureless night. The breath coming out of the
nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small
leaf, a black feather, a single fiber of hair.
He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt
the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick....

10

Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small handheld fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over
which the life of the world ran, not touching them.
"Mildred ! "
Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might
fall; but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving
shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the
thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and
breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out of her nostrils, and
her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.
The object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under
the edge of his own bed. The small crystal bottle of sleeping-tablets
which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now
lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare.
As he stood there the sky over the house screamed. There was a
tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand
miles of black linen down the seam. Montag was cut in half. He felt his
chest chopped down and split apart. The jet-bombs going over, going
over, going over, one two, one two, one two, six of them, nine of them,
twelve of them, one and one and one and another and another and
another, did all the screaming for him. He opened his own mouth and
let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth. The house
shook. The flare went out in his hand. The moonstones vanished. He
felt his hand plunge toward the telephone.
The jets were gone. He felt his lips move, brushing the mouthpiece
of the phone. "Emergency hospital." A terrible whisper.
He felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound

11

of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be thought as
he stood shivering in the dark, and let his lips go on moving and
moving.
They had this machine. They had two machines, really. One of them
slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well
looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank
up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil. Did it drink of
the darkness? Did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the
years? It fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation
and blind searching. It had an Eye. The impersonal operator of the
machine could, by wearing a special optical helmet, gaze into the soul
of the person whom he was pumping out. What did the Eye see? He
did not say. He saw but did not see what the Eye saw. The entire
operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in one's yard. The
woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they
had reached. Go on, anyway, shove the bore down, slush up the
emptiness, if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the
suction snake. The operator stood smoking a cigarette. The other
machine was working too.
The other machine was operated by an equally impersonal fellow
in non-stainable reddish-brown overalls. This machine pumped all of
the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum.
"Got to clean 'em out both ways," said the operator, standing over
the silent woman. "No use getting the stomach if you don't clean the
blood. Leave that stuff in the blood and the blood hits the brain like a
mallet, bang, a couple of thousand times and the brain just gives up,
just quits."

12

"Stop it!" said Montag.
"I was just sayin'," said the operator.
"Are you done?" said Montag.
They shut the machines up tight. "We're done." His anger did not
even touch them. They stood with the cigarette smoke curling around
their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint.
"That's fifty bucks."
"First, why don't you tell me if she'll be all right?"
"Sure, she'll be O.K. We got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase
here, it can't get at her now. As I said, you take out the old and put in
the new and you're O.K."
"Neither of you is an M.D. Why didn't they send an M.D. from
Emergency?"
"Hell! " the operator's cigarette moved on his lips. "We get these
cases nine or ten a night. Got so many, starting a few years ago, we had
the special machines built. With the optical lens, of course, that was
new; the rest is ancient. You don't need an M.D., case like this; all you
need is two handymen, clean up the problem in half an hour. Look"-he
started for the door-"we gotta go. Just had another call on the old earthimble. Ten blocks from here. Someone else just jumped off the cap of
a pillbox. Call if you need us again. Keep her quiet. We got a contrasedative in her. She'll wake up hungry. So long."
And the men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths, the
men with the eyes of puff-adders, took up their load of machine and
tube, their case of liquid melancholy and the slow dark sludge of
nameless stuff, and strolled out the door.
Montag sank down into a chair and looked at this woman. Her
eyes were closed now, gently, and he put out his hand to feel the
warmness of breath on his palm.
"Mildred," he said, at last.

13

There are too many of us, he thought. There are billions of us and
that's too many. Nobody knows anyone. Strangers come and violate
you. Strangers come and cut your heart out. Strangers come and take
your blood. Good God, who were those men? I never saw them before
in my life!
Half an hour passed.
The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have
done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were
very fresh and full of color and they looked soft and relaxed. Someone
else's blood there. If only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. If
only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaner's and
emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and
brought it back in the morning. If only . . .
He got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows
wide to let the night air in. It was two o'clock in the morning. Was it
only an hour ago, Clarisse McClellan in the street, and him coming in,
and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle? Only an
hour, but the world had melted down and sprung up in a new and
colorless form.
Laughter blew across the moon-colored lawn from the house of
Clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly
and so earnestly. Above all, their laughter was relaxed and hearty and
not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit
this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in
darkness. Montag heard the voices talking, talking, talking, giving,
talking, weaving, reweaving their hypnotic web.
Montag moved out through the French windows and crossed the
lawn, without even thinking of it. He stood outside the talking house in
the shadows, thinking he might even tap on

14

their door and whisper, "Let me come in. I won't say anything. I just
want to listen. What is it you're saying?"
But instead he stood there, very cold, his face a mask of ice,
listening to a man's voice (the uncle?) moving along at an easy pace:
"Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your
nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow,
wad, flush. Everyone using everyone else's coattails. How are you
supposed to root for the home team when you don't even have a
program or know the names? For that matter, what colour jerseys are
they wearing as they trot out on to the field?"
Montag moved back to his own house, left the window wide,
checked Mildred, tucked the covers about her carefully, and then lay
down with the moonlight on his cheek-bones and on the frowning
ridges in his brow, with the moonlight distilled in each eye to form a
silver cataract there.
One drop of rain. Clarisse. Another drop. Mildred. A third. The
uncle. A fourth. The fire tonight. One, Clarisse. Two, Mildred. Three,
uncle. Four, fire, One, Mildred, two, Clarisse. One, two, three, four,
five, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, sleeping-tablets, men, disposable
tissue, coat-tails, blow, wad, flush, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, tablets,
tissues, blow, wad, flush. One, two, three, one, two, three! Rain. The
storm. The uncle laughing. Thunder falling downstairs. The whole
world pouring down. The fire gushing up in a volcano. All rushing on
down around in a spouting roar and rivering stream toward morning.
"I don't know anything any more," he said, and let a sleep-lozenge
dissolve on his tongue.
At nine in the morning, Mildred's bed was empty.
Montag got up quickly, his heart pumping, and ran down the hall
and stopped at the kitchen door.

15

Toast popped out of the silver toaster, was seized by a spidery
metal hand that drenched it with melted butter.
Mildred watched the toast delivered to her plate. She had both
ears plugged with electronic bees that were humming the hour away.
She looked up suddenly, saw him, and nodded.
"You all right?" he asked.
She was an expert at lip-reading from ten years of apprenticeship
at Seashell ear-thimbles. She nodded again. She set the toaster clicking
away at another piece of bread.
Montag sat down.
His wife said, "I don't know why I should be so hungry."
"You-?"
"I'm hungry."
"Last night," he began.
"Didn't sleep well. Feel terrible," she said. "God, I'm hungry. I can't
figure it."
"Last night-" he said again.
She watched his lips casually. "What about last night?"
"Don't you remember?"
"What? Did we have a wild party or something? Feel like I've a
hangover. God, I'm hungry. Who was here?"
"A few people," he said.
"That's what I thought." She chewed her toast. "Sore stomach, but
I'm hungry as all-get-out. Hope I didn't do anything foolish at the
party."
"No," he said, quietly.
The toaster spidered out a piece of buttered bread for him. He held
it in his hand, feeling grateful.
"You don't look so hot yourself," said his wife.
***

In the late afternoon it rained and the entire world was dark grey. He
stood in the hall of his house, putting on his badge with the orange
salamander burning across it. He stood looking up at the airconditioning vent in the hall for a long time. His wife in the TV parlor
paused long enough from reading her script to glance up. "Hey," she
said. "The man's thinking!"
"Yes," he said. "I wanted to talk to you." He paused. "You took all
the pills in your bottle last night."
"Oh, I wouldn't do that," she said, surprised.
"The bottle was empty."
"I wouldn't do a thing like that. Why would I do a thing like that?"
she asked.
"Maybe you took two pills and forgot and took two more, and
forgot again and took two more, and were so dopy you kept right on
until you had thirty or forty of them in you."
"Heck," she said, "what would I want to go and do a silly thing like
that for?"
"I don't know," he said.
She was quite obviously waiting for him to go. "I didn't do that,"
she said. "Never in a billion years."
"All right if you say so," he said.
"That's what the lady said." She turned back to her script.
"What's on this afternoon?" he asked tiredly.
She didn't look up from her script again. "Well, this is a play comes
on the wall-to-wall circuit in ten minutes. They mailed me my part this
morning. I sent in some box-tops. They write the script with one part
missing. It's a new idea. The home-maker, that's me, is the missing part.
When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the
three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, `What
do you think of

17

this whole idea, Helen?' And he looks at me sitting here centre stage,
see? And I say, I say --" She paused and ran her finger under a line in
the script. " `I think that's fine!' And then they go on with the play until
he says, `Do you agree to that, Helen!' and I say, `I sure do!' Isn't that
fun, Guy?"
He stood in the hall looking at her.
"It's sure fun," she said.
"What's the play about?"
"I just told you. There are these people named Bob and Ruth and
Helen."
"Oh."
"It's really fun. It'll be even more fun when we can afford to have
the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and
get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? It's only two
thousand dollars."
"That's one-third of my yearly pay."
"It's only two thousand dollars," she replied. "And I should think
you'd consider me sometimes. If we had a fourth wall, why it'd be just
like this room wasn't ours at all, but all kinds of exotic people's rooms.
We could do without a few things."
"We're already doing without a few things to pay for the third
wall. It was put in only two months ago, remember?"
"Is that all it was?" She sat looking at him for a long moment.
"Well, good-bye, dear." .
"Good-bye," he said. He stopped and turned around. "Does it have
a happy ending?"
"I haven't read that far."
He walked over, read the last page, nodded, folded the script, and
handed it back to her. He walked out of the house into the rain.
***

18

The rain was thinning away and the girl was walking in the centre of
the sidewalk with her head up and the few drops falling on her face.
She smiled when she saw Montag.
"Hello! "
He said hello and then said, "What are you up to now?"
"I'm still crazy. The rain feels good. I love to walk in it.
"I don't think I'd like that," he said.
"You might if you tried."
"I never have."
She licked her lips. "Rain even tastes good."
"What do you do, go around trying everything once?" he asked.
"Sometimes twice." She looked at something in her hand.
"What've you got there?" he said.
"I guess it's the last of the dandelions this year. I didn't think I'd
find one on the lawn this late. Have you ever heard of rubbing it under
your chin? Look." She touched her chin with the flower, laughing.
"Why?"
"If it rubs off, it means I'm in love. Has it?"
He could hardly do anything else but look.
"Well?" she said.
"You're yellow under there."
"Fine! Let's try YOU now."
"It won't work for me."
"Here." Before he could move she had put the dandelion under his
chin. He drew back and she laughed. "Hold still!"
She peered under his chin and frowned.
"Well?" he said.
"What a shame," she said. "You're not in love with anyone."
"Yes, I am! "

19

"It doesn't show."
"I am very much in love!" He tried to conjure up a face to fit the
words, but there was no face. "I am ! "
"Oh please don't look that way."
"It's that dandelion," he said. "You've used it all up on yourself.
That's why it won't work for me."
"Of course, that must be it. Oh, now I've upset you, I can see I
have; I'm sorry, really I am." She touched his elbow.
"No, no," he said, quickly, "I'm all right."
"I've got to be going, so say you forgive me. I don't want you
angry with me."
"I'm not angry. Upset, yes."
"I've got to go to see my psychiatrist now. They make me go. I
made up things to say. I don't know what he thinks of me. He says I'm
a regular onion! I keep him busy peeling away the layers."
"I'm inclined to believe you need the psychiatrist," said Montag.
"You don't mean that."
He took a breath and let it out and at last said, "No, I don't mean
that."
"The psychiatrist wants to know why I go out and hike around in
the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies. I'll show you my
collection some day."
"Good."
"They want to know what I do with all my time. I tell them that
sometimes I just sit and think. But I won't tell them what. I've got them
running. And sometimes, I tell them, I like to put my head back, like
this, and let the rain fall into my mouth. It tastes just like wine. Have
you ever tried it?"
"No I--"

20

"You have forgiven me, haven't you?"
"Yes." He thought about it. "Yes, I have. God knows why. You're
peculiar, you're aggravating, yet you're easy to forgive. You say you're
seventeen?"
"Well-next month."
"How odd. How strange. And my wife thirty and yet you seem so
much older at times. I can't get over it."
"You're peculiar yourself, Mr. Montag. Sometimes I even forget
you're a fireman. Now, may I make you angry again?"
"Go ahead."
"How did it start? How did you get into it? How did you pick your
work and how did you happen to think to take the job you have?
You're not like the others. I've seen a few; I know. When I talk, you look
at me. When I said something about the moon, you looked at the moon,
last night. The others would never do that. The others would walk off
and leave me talking. Or threaten me. No one has time any more for
anyone else. You're one of the few who put up with me. That's why I
think it's so strange you're a fireman, it just doesn't seem right for you,
somehow."
He felt his body divide itself into a hotness and a coldness, a
softness and a hardness, a trembling and a not trembling, the two
halves grinding one upon the other.
"You'd better run on to your appointment," he said.
And she ran off and left him standing there in the rain. Only after
a long time did he move.
And then, very slowly, as he walked, he tilted his head back in the
rain, for just a few moments, and opened his mouth....
The Mechanical Hound slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live in
its gently humming, gently vibrating, softly illuminated

21

kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse. The dim light of one in
the morning, the moonlight from the open sky framed through the
great window, touched here and there on the brass and the copper and
the steel of the faintly trembling beast. Light flickered on bits of ruby
glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of
the creature that quivered gently, gently, gently, its eight legs spidered
under it on rubber-padded paws.
Montag slid down the brass pole. He went out to look at the city
and the clouds had cleared away completely, and he lit a cigarette and
came back to bend down and look at the Hound. It was like a great bee
come home from some field where the honey is full of poison wildness,
of insanity and nightmare, its body crammed with that over-rich nectar
and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself.
"Hello," whispered Montag, fascinated as always with the dead
beast, the living beast.
Nights when things got dull, which was every night, the men slid
down the brass poles, and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory
system of the Hound and let loose rats in the firehouse area-way, and
sometimes chickens, and sometimes cats that would have to be
drowned anyway, and there would be betting to see which the Hound
would seize first. The animals were turned loose. Three seconds later
the game was done, the rat, cat, or chicken caught half across the
areaway, gripped in gentling paws while a four-inch hollow steel
needle plunged down from the proboscis of the Hound to inject
massive jolts of morphine or procaine. The pawn was then tossed in the
incinerator. A new game began.
Montag stayed upstairs most nights when this went on. There had
been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them, and
lost a week's salary and faced Mildred's in-

22

sane anger, which showed itself in veins and blotches. But now at night
he lay in his bunk, face turned to the wall, listening to whoops of
laughter below and the piano-string scurry of rat feet, the violin
squeaking of mice, and the great shadowing, motioned silence of the
Hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light, finding, holding its
victim, inserting the needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a
switch had been turned.
Montag touched the muzzle. .
The Hound growled.
Montag jumped back.
The Hound half rose in its kennel and looked at him with greenblue neon light flickering in its suddenly activated eyebulbs. It growled
again, a strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle, a frying sound,
a scraping of metal, a turning of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient
with suspicion.
"No, no, boy," said Montag, his heart pounding.
He saw the silver needle extended upon the air an inch, pull back,
extend, pull back. The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at
him.
Montag backed up. The Hound took a step from its kennel.
Montag grabbed the brass pole with one hand. The pole, reacting, slid
upward, and took him through the ceiling, quietly. He stepped off in
the half-lit deck of the upper level. He was trembling and his face was
green-white. Below, the Hound had sunk back down upon its eight
incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again, its multi-faceted
eyes at peace.
Montag stood, letting the fears pass, by the drop-hole. Behind him,
four men at a card table under a green-lidded light in the corner
glanced briefly but said nothing. Only the man with the Captain's hat
and the sign of the Phoenix on his hat, at last, curious, his playing cards
in his thin hand, talked across the long room.

23

"Montag . . . ?"
"It doesn't like me," said Montag.
"What, the Hound?" The Captain studied his cards.
"Come off it. It doesn't like or dislike. It just `functions.' It's like a lesson
in ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide for it. It follows through. It
targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. It's only copper wire, storage
batteries, and electricity."
Montag swallowed. "Its calculators can be set to any combination,
so many amino acids, so much sulphur, so much butterfat and alkaline.
Right?"
"We all know that."
"All of those chemical balances and percentages on all of us here in
the house are recorded in the master file downstairs. It would be easy
for someone to set up a partial combination on the Hound's 'memory,' a
touch of amino acids, perhaps. That would account for what the animal
did just now. Reacted toward me."
"Hell," said the Captain.
"Irritated, but not completely angry. Just enough 'memory' set up
in it by someone so it growled when I touched it."
"Who would do a thing like that?." asked the Captain. "You
haven't any enemies here, Guy."
"None that I know of."
"We'll have the Hound checked by our technicians tomorrow.
"This isn't the first time it's threatened me," said Montag. "Last
month it happened twice."
"We'll fix it up. Don't worry"
But Montag did not move and only stood thinking of the ventilator
grille in the hall at home and what lay hidden behind the grille. If
someone here in the firehouse knew about the ventilator then mightn't
they "tell" the Hound . . . ?

24

The Captain came over to the drop-hole and gave Montag a
questioning glance.
"I was just figuring," said Montag, "what does the Hound think
about down there nights? Is it coming alive on us, really? It makes me
cold."
"It doesn't think anything we don't want it to think."
"That's sad," said Montag, quietly, "because all we put into it is
hunting and finding and killing. What a shame if that's all it can ever
know."'
Beatty snorted, gently. "Hell! It's a fine bit of craftsmanship, a good
rifle that can fetch its own target and guarantees the bull's-eye every
time."
"That's why," said Montag. "I wouldn't want to be its next victim.
"Why? You got a guilty conscience about something?"
Montag glanced up swiftly.
Beatty stood there looking at him steadily with his eyes, while his
mouth opened and began to laugh, very softly.
One two three four five six seven days. And as many times he came out
of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he
saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn
knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late
flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some
autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumbtacked to his door. Every day Clarisse walked him to the corner. One
day it was raining, the next it was clear, the day after that the wind
blew strong, and the day after that it was mild and calm, and the day
after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer and Clarisse
with her face all sunburnt by late afternoon.

25

"Why is it," he said, one time, at the subway entrance, "I feel I've
known you so many years?"
"Because I like you," she said, "and I don't want anything from
you. And because we know each other."
"You make me feel very old and very much like a father."
"Now you explain," she said, "why you haven't any daughters like
me, if you love children so much?"
"I don't know."
"You're joking!"
"I mean-" He stopped and shook his head. "Well, my wife, she . . .
she just never wanted any children at all."
The girl stopped smiling. "I'm sorry. I really, thought you were
having fun at my expense. I'm a fool."
"No, no," he said. "It was a good question. It's been a long time
since anyone cared enough to ask. A good question."
"Let's talk about something else. Have you ever smelled old
leaves? Don't they smell like cinnamon? Here. Smell."
"Why, yes, it is like cinnamon in a way."
She looked at him with her clear dark eyes. "You always seem
shocked."
"It's just I haven't had time--"
"Did you look at the stretched-out billboards like I told you?"
"I think so. Yes." He had to laugh.
"Your laugh sounds much nicer than it did"
"Does it?"
"Much more relaxed."
He felt at ease and comfortable. "Why aren't you in school? I see
you every day wandering around."
"Oh, they don't miss me," she said. "I'm anti-social, they say. I don't
mix. It's so strange. I'm very social indeed. It all depends

26

on what you mean by social, doesn't it? Social to me means talking
about things like this." She rattled some chestnuts that had fallen off the
tree in the front yard. "Or talking about how strange the world is. Being
with people is nice. But I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people
together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an
hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription
history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we
never ask questions, or at least most don't; they just run the answers at
you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of filmteacher. That's not social to me at all. It's a lot of funnels and a lot of
water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and them telling us
it's wine when it's not. They run us so ragged by the end of the day we
can't do anything but go to bed or head for a Fun Park to bully people
around, break windowpanes in the Window Smasher place or wreck
cars in the Car Wrecker place with the big steel ball. Or go out in the
cars and race on the streets, trying to see how close you can get to
lamp-posts, playing `chicken' and 'knock hub-caps.' I guess I'm
everything they say I am, all right. I haven't any friends. That's
supposed to prove I'm abnormal. But everyone I know is either
shouting or dancing around like wild or beating up one another. Do
you notice how people hurt each other nowadays?"
"You sound so very old."
"Sometimes I'm ancient. I'm afraid of children my own age. They
kill each other. Did it always used to be that way? My uncle says no. Six
of my friends have been shot in the last year alone. Ten of them died in
car wrecks. I'm afraid of them and they don't like me because I'm
afraid. My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children
didn't kill each other. But that was a long time ago when they had
things different. They believed

27

in responsibility, my uncle says. Do you know, I'm responsible. I was
spanked when I needed it, years ago. And I do all the shopping and
house-cleaning by hand.
"But most of all," she said, "I like to watch people. Sometimes I ride
the subway all day and look at them and listen to them. I just want to
figure out who they are and what they want and where they're going.
Sometimes I even go to the Fun Parks and ride in the jet cars when they
race on the edge of town at midnight and the police don't care as long
as they're insured. As long as everyone has ten thousand insurance
everyone's happy. Sometimes I sneak around and listen in subways. Or
I listen at soda fountains, and do you know what?"
"What?"
"People don't talk about anything."
"Oh, they must!"
"No, not anything. They name a lot of cars or clothes or
swimming-pools mostly and say how swell! But they all say the same
things and nobody says anything different from anyone else. And most
of the time in the cafes they have the joke-boxes on and the same jokes
most of the time, or the musical wall lit and all the colored patterns
running up and down, but it's only color and all abstract. And at the
museums, have you ever been? All abstract. That's all there is now. My
uncle says it was different once. A long time back sometimes pictures
said things or even showed people."
"Your uncle said, your uncle said. Your uncle must be a
remarkable man."
"He is. He certainly is. Well, I've got to be going. Goodbye, Mr.
Montag."
"Good-bye."
"Good-bye...."

28

***
One two three four five six seven days: the firehouse.
"Montag, you shin that pole like a bird up a tree."
Third day.
"Montag, I see you came in the back door this time. The Hound
bother you?"
"No, no."
Fourth day.
"Montag, a funny thing. Heard tell this morning. Fireman in
Seattle, purposely set a Mechanical Hound to his own chemical
complex and let it loose. What kind of suicide would you call that?"
Five six seven days.
And then, Clarisse was gone. He didn't know what there was
about the afternoon, but it was not seeing her somewhere in the world.
The lawn was empty, the trees empty, the street empty, and while at
first he did not even know he missed her or was even looking for her,
the fact was that by the time he reached the subway, there were vague
stirrings of un-ease in him. Something was the matter, his routine had
been disturbed. A simple routine, true, established in a short few days,
and yet . . . ? He almost turned back to make the walk again, to give her
time to appear. He was certain if he tried the same route, everything
would work out fine. But it was late, and the arrival of his train put a
stop to his plan.
The flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the timevoice in the firehouse ceiling ". . . one thirty-five. Thursday morning,
November 4th,... one thirty-six . . . one thirty-seven a.m... " The tick of
the playing-cards on the greasy table-top, all the sounds came to
Montag, behind his closed eyes, behind the

29

barrier he had momentarily erected. He could feel the firehouse full of
glitter and shine and silence, of brass colors, the colors of coins, of gold,
of silver: The unseen men across the table were sighing on their cards,
waiting. ". . .one forty-five..." The voice-clock mourned out the cold
hour of a cold morning of a still colder year.
"What's wrong, Montag?"
Montag opened his eyes.
A radio hummed somewhere. ". . . war may be declared any hour.
This country stands ready to defend its--"
The firehouse trembled as a great flight of jet planes whistled a
single note across the black morning sky.
Montag blinked. Beatty was looking at him as if he were a
museum statue. At any moment, Beatty might rise and walk about him,
touching, exploring his guilt and self-consciousness. Guilt? What guilt
was that?
"Your play, Montag."
Montag looked at these men whose faces were sunburnt by a
thousand real and ten thousand imaginary fires, whose work flushed
their cheeks and fevered their eyes. These men who looked steadily
into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning
black pipes. They and their charcoal hair and soot-colored brows and
bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had shaven close; but their
heritage showed. Montag started up, his mouth opened. Had he ever
seen a fireman that didn't have black hair, black brows, a fiery face, and
a blue-steel shaved but unshaved look? These men were all mirrorimages of himself! Were all firemen picked then for their looks as well
as their proclivities? The color of cinders and ash about them, and the
continual smell of burning from their pipes. Captain Beatty there, rising
in thunderheads of tobacco smoke. Beatty opening a fresh tobacco
packet, crumpling the cellophane into a sound of fire.

30

Montag looked at the cards in his own hands. "I-I've been thinking.
About the fire last week. About the man whose library we fixed. What
happened to him?"
"They took him screaming off to the asylum"
"He. wasn't insane."
Beatty arranged his cards quietly. "Any man's insane who thinks
he can fool the Government and us."
"I've tried to imagine," said Montag, "just how it would feel. I
mean to have firemen burn our houses and our books."
"We haven't any books."
"But if we did have some."
"You got some?"
Beatty blinked slowly.
"No." Montag gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists
of a million forbidden books. Their names leapt in fire, burning down
the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but
kerosene. "No." But in his mind, a cool wind started up and blew out of
the ventilator grille at home, softly, softly, chilling his face. And, again,
he saw himself in a green park talking to an old man, a very old man,
and the wind from the park was cold, too.
Montag hesitated, "Was-was it always like this? The firehouse, our
work? I mean, well, once upon a time..."
"Once upon a time!" Beatty said. "What kind of talk is that?"
Fool, thought Montag to himself, you'll give it away. At the last
fire, a book of fairy tales, he'd glanced at a single line. "I mean," he said,
"in the old days, before homes were completely fireproofed " Suddenly
it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him. He opened his
mouth and it was Clarisse McClellan saying, "Didn't firemen prevent
fires rather than stoke them up and get them going?"

31

"That's rich!" Stoneman and Black drew forth their rulebooks,
which also contained brief histories of the Firemen of America, and laid
them out where Montag, though long familiar with them, might read:
"Established, 1790, to burn English-influenced books in the Colonies.
First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin."
RULE

1. Answer the alarm swiftly.
2. Start the fire swiftly.
3. Burn everything.
4. Report back to firehouse immediately.
5. Stand alert for other alarms.

Everyone watched Montag. He did not move.
The alarm sounded.
The bell in the ceiling kicked itself two hundred times. Suddenly
there were four empty chairs. The cards fell in a flurry of snow. The
brass pole shivered. The men were gone.
Montag sat in his chair. Below, the orange dragon coughed into
life.
Montag slid down the pole like a man in a dream.
The Mechanical Hound leapt up in its kennel, its eyes all green
flame.
"Montag, you forgot your helmet!"
He seized it off the wall behind him, ran, leapt, and they were off,
the night wind hammering about their siren scream and their mighty
metal thunder!
It was a flaking three-storey house in the ancient part of the city, a
century old if it was a day, but like all houses it had been given

32

a thin fireproof plastic sheath many years ago, and this preservative
shell seemed to be the only thing holding it in the sky.
"Here we are !"
The engine slammed to a stop. Beatty, Stoneman, and Black ran up
the sidewalk, suddenly odious and fat in the plump fireproof slickers.
Montag followed.
They crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman, though she
was not running, she was not trying to escape. She was only standing,
weaving from side to side, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the
wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head. Her tongue
was moving in her mouth, and her eyes seemed to be trying to
remember something, and then they remembered and her tongue
moved again:
"'Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a
candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.'"
"Enough of that!" said Beatty. "Where are they?"
He slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the
question. The old woman's eyes came to a focus upon Beatty. "You
know where they are or you wouldn't be here," she said.
Stoneman held out the telephone alarm card with the complaint
signed in telephone duplicate on the back
"Have reason to suspect attic; 11 No. Elm, City. --- E. B."
"That would be Mrs. Blake, my neighbor;" said the woman,
reading the initials.
"All right, men, let's get 'em!"
Next thing they were up in musty blackness, swinging silver
hatchets at doors that were, after all, unlocked, tumbling through like
boys all rollick and shout. "Hey! " A fountain of books sprang down
upon Montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stair-well. How
inconvenient! Always before it had been like

33

snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victim's
mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when
you arrived you found an empty house. You weren't hurting anyone,
you were hurting only things! And since things really couldn't be hurt,
since things felt nothing, and things don't scream or whimper, as this
woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease
your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work,
essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene!
Who's got a match!
But now, tonight, someone had slipped. This woman was spoiling
the ritual. The men were making too much noise, laughing, joking to
cover her terrible accusing silence below. She made the empty rooms
roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was
sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor
correct. Montag felt an immense irritation. She shouldn't be here, on
top of everything!
Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face A
book alighted, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands,
wings fluttering. In the dim, wavering light, a page hung open and it
was like a snowy feather, the words delicately painted thereon. In all
the rush and fervor, Montag had only an instant to read a line, but it
blazed in his mind for the next minute as if stamped there with fiery
steel. "Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine." He dropped
the book. Immediately, another fell into his arms.
"Montag, up here! "
Montag's hand closed like a mouth, crushed the book with wild
devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above
were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air. They fell like
slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among
the bodies.

34

Montag had done nothing. His hand had done it all, his hand, with
a brain of its own, with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling
finger, had turned thief.. Now, it plunged the book back under his arm,
pressed it tight to sweating armpit, rushed out empty, with a
magician's flourish! Look here! Innocent! Look!
He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he
were far-sighted. He held it close, as if he were blind.
"Montag! "
He jerked about.
"Don't stand there, idiot!"
The books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry. The men
danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden
eyes, falling, gone.
"Kerosene!”
They pumped the cold fluid from the numbered 451 tanks
strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book, they pumped
rooms full of it.
They hurried downstairs, Montag staggered after them in the
kerosene fumes.
"Come on, woman!"
The woman knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather
and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes
accused Montag.
"You can't ever have my books," she said.
"You know the law," said Beatty. "Where's your common sense?
None of those books agree with each other. You've been locked up here
for years with a regular damned Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The
people in those books never lived. Come on now! "
She shook her head.

35

"The whole house is going up," said Beatty,
The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at
Montag, who stood near the woman.
"You're not leaving her here?" he protested.
"She won't come."
"Force her, then!"
Beatty raised his hand in which was concealed the igniter. "We're
due back at the house. Besides, these fanatics always try suicide; the
pattern's familiar."
Montag placed his hand on the woman's elbow. "You can come
with me."
"No," she said. "Thank you, anyway."
"I'm counting to ten," said Beatty. "One. Two."
"Please," said Montag.
"Go on," said the woman.
"Three. Four."
"Here." Montag pulled at the woman.
The woman replied quietly, "I want to stay here"
"Five. Six."
"You can stop counting," she said. She opened the fingers of one
hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.
An ordinary kitchen match.
The sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house.
Captain Beatty, keeping his dignity, backed slowly through the front
door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night
excitements. God, thought Montag, how true! Always at night the
alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because the fire is prettier by night?
More spectacle, a better show? The pink face of Beatty now showed the
faintest panic in the door. The woman's hand twitched on the single
matchstick. The

36

fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. Montag felt the hidden book
pound like a heart against his chest.
"Go on," said the woman, and Montag felt himself back away and
away out of the door, after Beatty, down the steps, across the lawn,
where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail.
On the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly
with her eyes, her quietness a condemnation, the woman stood
motionless.
Beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene.
He was too late. Montag gasped.
The woman on the porch reached out with contempt for them all,
and struck the kitchen match against the railing.
People ran out of houses all down the street.
They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse. Nobody
looked at anyone else. Montag sat in the front seat with Beatty and
Black. They did not even smoke their pipes. They sat there looking out
of the front of the great salamander as they turned a corner and went
silently on.
"Master Ridley," said Montag at last.
"What?" said Beatty.
"She said, `Master Ridley.' She said some crazy thing when we
came in the door. `Play the man,' she said, `Master Ridley.' Something,
something, something."
" `We shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in
England, as I trust shall never be put out,"' said Beatty. Stoneman
glanced over at the Captain, as did Montag, startled.
Beatty rubbed his chin. "A man named Latimer said that to a man
named Nicholas Ridley, as they were being burnt alive at Oxford, for
heresy, on October 16, 1555."

37

Montag and Stoneman went back to looking at the street as it
moved under the engine wheels.
"I'm full of bits and pieces," said Beatty. "Most fire captains have to
be. Sometimes I surprise myself. Watch it, Stoneman!"
Stoneman braked the truck.
"Damn!" said Beatty. "You've gone right by the comer where we
turn for the firehouse."
"Who is it?"
"Who would it be?" said Montag, leaning back against the closed
door in the dark.
His wife said, at last, "Well, put on the light."
"I don't want the light."
"Come to bed."
He heard her roll impatiently; the bedsprings squealed.
"Are you drunk?" she said.
So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the
other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants
out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been
infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison
working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders, and then
the jump-over from shoulder-blade to shoulder-blade like a spark
leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning
to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.
His wife said, "What are you doing?"
He balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers.
A minute later she said, "Well, just don't stand there in the middle
of the floor."
He made a small sound.

38

"What?" she asked.
He made more soft sounds. He stumbled towards the bed and
shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow. He fell into bed and
his wife cried out, startled. He lay far across the room from her, on a
winter island separated by an empty sea. She talked to him for what
seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about
that and it was only words, like the words he had heard once in a
nursery at a friend's house, a two-year-old child building word
patterns, talking jargon, making pretty sounds in the air. But Montag
said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small
sounds, he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand
over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek. He knew that when
she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet.
Late in the night he looked over at Mildred. She was awake. There was
a tiny dance of melody in the air, her Seashell was tamped in her ear
again and she was listening to far people in far places, her eyes wide
and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling.
Wasn't there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the
telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and
telephoned her to ask what was for dinner? Well, then, why didn't he
buy himself an audio-Seashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife
late at night, murmur, whisper, shout, scream, yell? But what would he
whisper, what would he yell? What could he say?
And suddenly she was so strange he couldn't believe he knew her
at all. He was in someone else's house, like those other jokes people
told of the gentleman, drunk, coming home late at night, unlocking the
wrong door, entering a wrong room,

39

and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work
and neither of them the wiser.
"Millie.... ?" he whispered.
"What?"
"I didn't mean to startle you. What I want to know is ...."
"Well?"
"When did we meet. And where?"
"When did we meet for what?" she asked.
"I mean-originally."
He knew she must be frowning in the dark.
He clarified it. "The first time we ever met, where was it, and
when?"
"Why, it was at --"
She stopped.
"I don't know," she said.
He was cold. "Can't you remember?"
"It's been so long."
"Only ten years, that's all, only ten!"
"Don't get excited, I'm trying to think." She laughed an odd little
laugh that went up and up. "Funny, how funny, not to remember
where or when you met your husband or wife."
He lay massaging his eyes, his brow, and the back of his neck,
slowly. He held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure
there as if to crush memory into place. It was suddenly more important
than any other thing in a life-time that he knew where he had met
Mildred.
"It doesn't matter," She was up in the bathroom now, and he heard
the water running, and the swallowing sound she made.
"No, I guess not," he said.
He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought
of the visit from the two zinc-oxide-faced men with

40

the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths and the electronic-eyed
snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and
stagnant spring water, and he wanted to call out to her, how many
have you taken TONIGHT! the capsules! how many will you take later
and not know? and so on, every hour! or maybe not tonight, tomorrow
night! And me not sleeping, tonight or tomorrow night or any night for
a long while; now that this has started. And he thought of her lying on
the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her, not bent
with concern, but only standing straight, arms folded. And he
remembered thinking then that if she died, he was certain he wouldn't
cry. For it would be the dying of an unknown, a street face, a
newspaper image, and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had
begun to cry, not at death but at the thought of not crying at death, a
silly empty man near a silly empty woman, while the hungry snake
made her still more empty.
How do you get so empty? he wondered. Who takes it out of you?
And that awful flower the other day, the dandelion! It had summed up
everything, hadn't it? "What a shame! You're not in love with anyone !"
And why not?
Well, wasn't there a wall between him and Mildred, when you
came down to it? Literally not just one, wall but, so far, three! And
expensive, too! And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the
nephews, that lived in those walls, the gibbering pack of tree-apes that
said nothing, nothing, nothing and said it loud, loud, loud. He had
taken to calling them relatives from the very first. "How's Uncle Louis
today?" "Who?" "And Aunt Maude?" The most significant memory he
had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how
odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees
(you could feel the memory of their shapes all about) sitting in the
center of

41

the "living-room." The living-room; what a good job of labeling that
was now. No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to
Mildred.
"Something must be done!"
"Yes, something must be done!"
"Well, let's not stand and talk!"
"Let's do it! "
"I'm so mad I could spit!"
What was it all about? Mildred couldn't say. Who was mad at
whom? Mildred didn't quite know. What were they going to do? Well,
said Mildred, wait around and see.
He had waited around to see.
A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music
bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost
shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in
his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt
like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge
and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and
emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-never-never-quite-no not
quite-touched-bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides
either ... never ... quite . . . touched . . . anything.
The thunder faded. The music died.
"There," said Mildred,
And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even
though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and
nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone
had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic
vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of
the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred
sat in her chair and the voices went on again:

42

"Well, everything will be all right now," said an "aunt."
"Oh, don't be too sure," said a "cousin."
"Now, don't get angry!"
"Who's angry?"
"You are ! "
“I am?”
"You're mad!"
"Why would I be mad!"
"Because!"
"That's all very well," cried Montag, "but what are they mad
about? Who are these people? Who's that man and who's that woman?
Are they husband and wife, are they divorced, engaged, what? Good
God, nothing's connected up."
"They--" said Mildred. "Well, they-they had this fight, you see.
They certainly fight a lot. You should listen. I think they're married.
Yes, they're married. Why?"
And if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the
dream complete, then it was the open car and Mildred driving a
hundred miles an hour across town, he shouting at her and she
shouting back and both trying to hear what was said, but hearing only
the scream of the car. "At least keep it down to the minimum !" he
yelled: "What?" she cried. "Keep it down to fifty-five, the minimum! "
he shouted. "The what?" she shrieked. "Speed!" he shouted. And she
pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath
from his mouth.
When they stepped out of the car, she had the Seashells stuffed in
her ears.
Silence. Only the wind blowing softly.
"Mildred." He stirred in bed.
He reached over and pulled one of the tiny musical insects out of
her ear. "Mildred. Mildred?"

43

"Yes." Her voice was faint.
He felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between
the slots of the phono-color walls, speaking, but the speech not piercing
the crystal barrier. He could only pantomime, hoping she would turn
his way and see him. They could not touch through the glass.
"Mildred, do you know that girl I was telling you about?"
"What girl?" She was almost asleep.
"The girl next door."
"What girl next door?"
"You know, the high-school girl. Clarisse, her name is."
"Oh, yes," said his wife.
"I haven't seen her for a few days-four days to be exact. Have you
seen her?"
"No."
"I've meant to talk to you about her. Strange."
"Oh, I know the one you mean."
"I thought you would."
"Her," said Mildred in the dark room.
"What about her?" asked Montag.
"I meant to tell you. Forgot. Forgot."
"Tell me now. What is it?"
"I think she's gone."
"Gone?"
"Whole family moved out somewhere. But she's gone for good. I
think she's dead."
"We couldn't be talking about the same girl."
"No. The same girl. McClellan. McClellan, Run over by a car. Four
days ago. I'm not sure. But I think she's dead. The family moved out
anyway. I don't know. But I think she's dead."
"You're not sure of it! "

44

"No, not sure. Pretty sure."
"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
"Forgot."
"Four days ago!"
"I forgot all about it."
"Four days ago," he said, quietly, lying there.
They lay there in the dark room not moving, either of them. "Good
night," she said.
He heard a faint rustle. Her hands moved. The electric thimble
moved like a praying mantis on the pillow, touched by her hand. Now
it was in her ear again, humming.
He listened and his wife was singing under her breath.
Outside the house, a shadow moved, an autumn wind rose up and
faded away But there was something else in the silence that he heard. It
was like a breath exhaled upon the window. It was like a faint drift of
greenish luminescent smoke, the motion of a single huge October leaf
blowing across the lawn and away.
The Hound, he thought. It's out there tonight. It's out there now. If
I opened the window . . .
He did not open the window.
He had chills and fever in the morning.
"You can't be sick," said Mildred.
He closed his eyes over the hotness. "Yes."
"But you were all right last night."
"No, I wasn't all right." He heard the "relatives" shouting in the
parlor.
Mildred stood over his bed, curiously. He felt her there, he saw her
without opening his eyes, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw,
her eyes with a kind of cataract unseen but suspect far behind the
pupils, the reddened pouting lips, the body

45

as thin as a praying mantis from dieting, and her flesh like white bacon.
He could remember her no other way.
"Will you bring me aspirin and water?"
"You've got to get up," she said. "It's noon. You've slept five hours
later than usual."
"Will you turn the parlor off?" he asked.
"That's my family."
"Will you turn it off for a sick man?"
"I'll turn it down."
She went out of the room and did nothing to the parlor and came
back. "Is that better?"
"Thanks."
"That's my favorite program," she said.
"What about the aspirin?"
"You've never been sick before." She went away again.
"Well, I'm sick now. I'm not going to work tonight. Call Beatty for
me."
"You acted funny last night." She returned, humming.
"Where's the aspirin?" He glanced at the water-glass she handed
him.
"Oh." She walked to the bathroom again. "Did something happen?"
"A fire, is all."
"I had a nice evening," she said, in the bathroom.
"What doing?"
"The parlor."
"What was on?"
"Programs."
"What programs?"
"Some of the best ever."
"Who?"

46

"Oh, you know, the bunch."
"Yes, the bunch, the bunch, the bunch." He pressed at the pain in
his eyes and suddenly the odor of kerosene made him vomit.
Mildred came in, humming. She was surprised. "Why'd you do
that?"
He looked with dismay at the floor. "We burned an old woman
with her books."
"It's a good thing the rug's washable." She fetched a mop and
worked on it. "I went to Helen's last night."
"Couldn't you get the shows in your own parlor?"
"Sure, but it's nice visiting."
She went out into the parlor. He heard her singing.
"Mildred?" he called.
She returned, singing, snapping her fingers softly.
"Aren't you going to ask me about last night?" he said.
"What about it?"
"We burned a thousand books. We burned a woman."
"Well?"
The parlor was exploding with sound.
"We burned copies of Dante and Swift and Marcus Aurelius."
"Wasn't he a European?"
"Something like that."
"Wasn't he a radical?"
"I never read him."
"He was a radical." Mildred fiddled with the telephone. "You don't
expect me to call Captain Beatty, do you?"
"You must! "
"Don't shout!"
"I wasn't shouting." He was up in bed, suddenly, enraged

47

and flushed, shaking. The parlor roared in the hot air. "I can't call him. I
can't tell him I'm sick."
"Why?"
Because you're afraid, he thought. A child feigning illness, afraid
to call because after a moment's discussion, the conversation would run
so: "Yes, Captain, I feel better already. I'll be in at ten o'clock tonight."
"You're not sick," said Mildred.
Montag fell back in bed. He reached under his pillow. The hidden
book was still there.
"Mildred, how would it be if, well, maybe, I quit my job awhile?"
"You want to give up everything? After all these years of working,
because, one night, some woman and her books--"
"You should have seen her, Millie! "
"She's nothing to me; she shouldn't have had books. It was her
responsibility, she should have thought of that. I hate her. She's got you
going and next thing you know we'll be out, no house, no job, nothing."
"You weren't there, you didn't see," he said. "There must be
something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in
a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for
nothing."
"She was simple-minded."
"She was as rational as you and I, more so perhaps, and we burned
her."
"That's water under the bridge."
"No, not water; fire. You ever seen a burned house? It smolders for
days. Well, this fire'll last me the rest of my life. God! I've been trying to
put it out, in my mind, all night. I'm crazy with trying."

48

"You should have thought of that before becoming a fireman."
"Thought! " he said. "Was I given a choice? My grandfather and father
were firemen. In my sleep, I ran after them."
The parlor was playing a dance tune.
"This is the day you go on the early shift," said Mildred. "You
should have gone two hours ago. I just noticed."
"It's not just the woman that died," said Montag. "Last night I
thought about all the kerosene I've used in the past ten years. And I
thought about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was
behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had
to take a long time to put them down on paper. And I'd never even
thought that thought before." He got out of bed.
"It took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts
down, looking around at the world and life, and then I came along in
two minutes and boom! it's all over."
"Let me alone," said Mildred. "I didn't do anything."
"Let you alone! That's all very well, but how can I leave myself
alone? We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once
in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About
something important, about something real?"
And then he shut up, for he remembered last week and the two
white stones staring up at the ceiling and the pump-snake with the
probing eye and the two soap-faced men with the cigarettes moving in
their mouths when they talked. But that was another Mildred, that was
a Mildred so deep inside this one, and so bothered, really bothered,
that the two women had never met. He turned away.
Mildred said, "Well, now you've done it. Out front of the house.
Look who's here.".
"I don't care."

49

"There's a Phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt
with an orange snake stitched on his arm coming up the front walk."
"Captain Beauty?" he said,
"Captain Beatty."
Montag did not move, but stood looking into the cold whiteness of
the wall immediately before him.
"Go let him in, will you? Tell him I'm sick."
"Tell him yourself!" She ran a few steps this way, a few steps that,
and stopped, eyes wide, when the front door speaker called her name,
softly, softly, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here,
Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone's here. Fading.
Montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow,
climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and
across his chest, half-sitting, and after a while Mildred moved and went
out of the room and Captain Beatty strolled in, his hands in his pockets.
"Shut the 'relatives' up," said Beatty, looking around at everything
except Montag and his wife.
This time, Mildred ran. The yammering voices stopped yelling in
the parlor.
Captain Beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a
peaceful look on his ruddy face. He took time to prepare and light his
brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud. "Just thought I'd come by
and see how the sick man is."
"How'd you guess?"
Beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his
gums and the tiny candy whiteness of his teeth. "I've seen it all. You
were going to call for a night off."
Montag sat in bed.

50

"Well," said Beatty, "take the night off!" He examined his eternal
matchbox, the lid of which said GUARANTEED: ONE MILLION LIGHTS IN THIS
IGNITER, and began to strike the chemical match abstractedly, blow out,
strike, blow out, strike, speak a few words, blow out. He looked at the
flame. He blew, he looked at the smoke. "When will you be well?"
"Tomorrow. The next day maybe. First of the week."
Beatty puffed his pipe. "Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this.
They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to
know the history of our profession. They don't feed it to rookies like
they used to. Damn shame." Puff. "Only fire chiefs remember it now."
Puff. "I'll let you in on it."
Mildred fidgeted.
Beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for
what he wanted to say.
"When did it all start, you ask, this job of ours, how did it come
about, where, when? Well, I'd say it really got started around about a
thing called the Civil War. Even though our rule-book claims it was
founded earlier. The fact is we didn't get along well until photography
came into its own. Then--motion pictures in the early twentieth
century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass."
Montag sat in bed, not moving.
"And because they had mass, they became simpler," said Beatty.
"Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They
could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world
got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple
population. Films and radios, magazines, books leveled down to a sort
of paste pudding norm, do you follow me?"
"I think so."

51

Beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air.
"Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow
motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera. Books
cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to
the gag, the snap ending."
"Snap ending." Mildred nodded.
"Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill
a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line
dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for
reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you
know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumor of a
title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet
was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: now at least you can read
all the classics; keep up with your neighbors. Do you see? Out of the
nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your
intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more."
Mildred arose and began to move around the room, picking things
up and putting them down. Beatty ignored her and continued
"Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick,
Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where,
Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digestdigest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then,
in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl man's mind around about so fast under
the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the
centrifuge flings off all unnecessary, time-wasting thought!"
Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and
jump again as she patted his pillow. Right now she was pulling at his
shoulder to try to get him to move so she

52

could take the pillow out and fix it nicely and put it back. And perhaps
cry out and stare or simply reach down her hand and say, "What's
this?" and hold up the hidden book with touching innocence.
"School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories,
languages dropped, English and spelling gradually neglected, finally
almost completely ignored. Life is immediate, the job counts, pleasure
lies all about after work. Why learn anything save pressing buttons,
pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts?"
"Let me fix your pillow," said Mildred.
"No! " whispered Montag,
"The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much
time to think while dressing at. dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a
melancholy hour."
Mildred said, "Here."
"Get away," said Montag.
"Life becomes one big pratfall, Montag; everything bang; boff, and
wow!"
"Wow," said Mildred, yanking at the pillow.
"For God's sake, let me be!" cried Montag passionately.
Beatty opened his eyes wide.
Mildred's hand had frozen behind the pillow. Her fingers were
tracing the book's outline and as the shape became familiar her face
looked surprised and then stunned. Her mouth opened to ask a
question . . .
"Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with
glass walls and pretty colors running up and down the walls like
confetti or blood or sherry or sauterne. You like baseball, don't you,
Montag?"
"Baseball's a fine game."

53

Now Beatty was almost invisible, a voice somewhere behind a
screen of smoke
"What's this?" asked Mildred, almost with delight. Montag heaved
back against her arms. "What's this here?"
"Sit down!" Montag shouted. She jumped away, her hands empty.
"We're talking! "
Beatty went on as if nothing had happened. "You like bowling,
don't you, Montag?"
"Bowling, yes."
"And golf?"
"Golf is a fine game."
"Basketball?"
"A fine game."
"Billiards, pool? Football?"
"Fine games, all of them."
"More sports for everyone, group spirit, fun, and you don't have to
think, eh? Organize and organize and super organize super-super
sports. More cartoons in books. More pictures. The mind drinks less
and less. Impatience. Highways full of crowds going somewhere,
somewhere, somewhere, nowhere. The gasoline refugee. Towns turn
into motels, people in nomadic surges from place to place, following
the moon tides, living tonight in the room where you slept this noon
and I the night before."
Mildred went out of the room and slammed the door. The parlor
"aunts" began to laugh at the parlor "uncles.",
"Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we?
Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the
dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs,
Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes,
Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon
or Mexico. The people in this

54

book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual
painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market,
Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor
minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil
thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice
blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said,
were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But
the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comicbooks survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course.
There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down.
There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no!
Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick,
thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you
are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade journals."
"Yes, but what about the firemen, then?" asked Montag.
"Ah." Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his
pipe. "What more easily explained and natural? With school turning
out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers,
and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative
creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it
deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember
the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did
most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many
leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for
beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be
alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but
everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are
happy, for there are no mountains to make

55

them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in
the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach
man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well read man?
Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were
finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in
your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen
for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our
peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of
being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you,
Montag, and that's me."
The door to the parlor opened and Mildred stood there looking in
at them, looking at Beatty and then at Montag. Behind her the walls of
the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks
sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of
trap drums, tom-toms, and cymbals. Her mouth moved and she was
saying something but the sound covered it.
Beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand, studied
the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for
meaning.
"You must understand that our civilization is so vast that we can't
have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want
in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?
Haven't you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well,
aren't they? Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun?
That's all we live for, isn't it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must
admit our culture provides plenty of these."
"Yes."
Montag could lip-read what Mildred was saying in the

56

doorway. He tried not to look at her mouth, because then Beatty might
turn and read what was there, too.
"Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people
don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it. Someone's written a
book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are
weeping? Bum the book. Serenity, Montag. Peace, Montag. Take your
fight outside. Better yet, into the incinerator. Funerals are unhappy and
pagan? Eliminate them, too. Five minutes after a person is dead he's on
his way to the Big Flue, the Incinerators serviced by helicopters all over
the country. Ten minutes after death a man's a speck of black dust. Let's
not quibble over individuals with memoriams. Forget them. Burn them
all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean."
The fireworks died in the parlor behind Mildred. She had stopped
talking at the same time; a miraculous coincidence. Montag held his
breath.
"There was a girl next door," he said, slowly. "She's gone now, I
think, dead. I can't even remember her face. But she was different.
How? How did she happen?"
Beatty smiled. "Here or there, that's bound to occur. Clarisse
McClellan? We've a record on her family. We've watched them
carefully. Heredity and environment are funny things. You can't rid
yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. The home
environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've
lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost
snatching them from the cradle. We had some false alarms on the
McClellans, when they lived in Chicago. Never found a book. Uncle
had a mixed record; antisocial. The girl? She was a time bomb. The
family had been feeding her subconscious, I'm sure, from what I saw of
her school record. She didn't want to know how a thing was done, but
why. That can be em-

57

barrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very
unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girl's better off dead."
"Yes, dead."
"Luckily, queer ones like her don't happen, often. We know how to
nip most of them in the bud, early. You can't build a house without
nails and wood. If you don't want a house built, hide the nails and
wood. If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two
sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him
none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the Government is
inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that
people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win
by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state
capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed,
but absolutely `brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're
thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be
happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any
slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That
way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it
back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any
man who tries to slide-rule, measure, and equate the universe, which
just won't be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and
lonely. I know, I've tried it; to hell with it. So bring on your clubs and
parties, your acrobats and magicians, your dare-devils, jet cars,
motorcycle helicopters, your sex and heroin, more of everything to do
with automatic reflex. If the drama is bad, if the film says nothing, if the
play is hollow, sting me with the Theremin, loudly. I'll think I'm
responding to the play, when it's only a tactile reaction to vibration. But
I don't care. I just like solid entertainment."

58

Beatty got up. "I must be going. Lecture's over. I hope I've clarified
things. The important thing for you to remember, Montag, is we're the
Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand
against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy
with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dyke.
Hold steady. Don't let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy
drown our world. We depend on you. I don't think you realize how
important you are, we are, to our happy world as it stands now."
Beatty shook Montag's limp hand. Montag still sat, as if the house
were collapsing about him and he could not move, in the bed. Mildred
had vanished from the door.
"One last thing," said Beatty. "At least once in his career, every
fireman gets an itch. What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch
that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, I've had to read a few
in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing!
Nothing you can teach or believe. They're about nonexistent people,
figments of imagination, if they're fiction. And if they're nonfiction, it's
worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher
screaming down another's gullet. All of them running about, putting
out the stars and extinguishing the sun. You come away lost."
"Well, then, what if a fireman accidentally, really not, intending
anything, takes a book home with him?"
Montag twitched. The open door looked at him with its great
vacant eye.
"A natural error. Curiosity alone," said Beatty. "We don't get overanxious or mad. We let the fireman keep the book twenty?-our hours. If
he hasn't burned it by then, we simply come and burn it for him."
"Of course." Montag's mouth was dry.

59

"Well, Montag. Will you take another, later shift, today? Will we
see you tonight perhaps?"
"I don't know," said Montag.
"What?" Beatty looked faintly surprised.
Montag shut his eyes. "I'll be in later. Maybe."
"We'd certainly miss you if you didn't show," said Beatty, putting
his pipe in his pocket thoughtfully.
I'll never come in again, thought Montag.
"Get well and keep well," said Beatty.
He turned and went out through the open door.
Montag watched through the window as Beatty drove away in his
gleaming yellow-flame-colored beetle with the black, char-colored tires.
Across the street and down the way the other houses stood with
their flat fronts. What was it Clarisse had said one afternoon? "No front
porches. My uncle says there used to be front porches. And people sat
there sometimes at night, talking when they wanted to talk, rocking,
and not talking when they didn't want to talk. Sometimes they just sat
there and thought about things, turned things over. My uncle says the
architects got rid of the front porches because they didn't look well. But
my uncle says that was merely rationalizing it; the real reason, hidden
underneath, might be they didn't want people sitting like that, doing
nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life. People
talked too much. And they had time to think. So they ran off with the
porches. And the gardens, too. Not many gardens any more to sit
around in. And look at the furniture. No rocking chairs any more.
They're too comfortable. Get people up and running around. My uncle
says . . . and . . . my uncle . . . and . . . my uncle . . ." Her voice faded.

60

***
Montag turned and looked at his wife, who sat in the middle of the
parlor talking to an announcer, who in turn was talking to her. "Mrs.
Montag," he was saying. This, that and the other. "Mrs. Montag?"
Something else and still another. The converter attachment, which had
cost them one hundred dollars, automatically supplied her name
whenever the announcer addressed his anonymous audience, leaving a
blank where the proper syllables could be filled in. A special spotwavex-scrambler also caused his televised image, in the area
immediately about his lips, to mouth the vowels and consonants
beautifully. He was a friend, no doubt of it, a good friend. "Mrs.
Montag-now look right here."
Her head turned. Though she quite obviously was not listening.
Montag said, "It's only a step from not going to work today to not
working tomorrow, to not working at the firehouse ever again."
"You are going to work tonight, though, aren't you?" said Mildred.
"I haven't decided. Right now I've got an awful feeling I want to
smash things and kill things.”
"Go take the beetle."
"No thanks."
"The keys to the beetle are on the night table. I always like to drive
fast when I feel that way. You get it up around ninety-five and you feel
wonderful. Sometimes I drive all night and come back and you don't
know it. It's fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit
dogs. Go take the beetle."
"No, I don't want to, this time. I want to hold on to this funny
thing. God, it's gotten big on me. I don't know what it is. I'm so

61

damned unhappy, I'm so mad, and I don't know why I feel like I'm
putting on weight. I feel fat. I feel like I've been saving up a lot of
things, and don't know what. I might even start reading books."
"They'd put you in jail, wouldn't they?" She looked at him as if he
were behind the glass wall.
He began to put on his clothes, moving restlessly about the
bedroom. "Yes, and it might be a good idea. Before I hurt someone. Did
you hear Beatty? Did you listen to him? He knows all the answers. He's
right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept sitting
there saying to myself, I'm not happy, I'm not happy."
"I am." Mildred's mouth beamed. "And proud of it."
"I'm going to do something," said Montag. "I don't even know
what yet, but I'm going to do something big."
"I'm tired of listening to this junk," said Mildred, turning from him
to the announcer again
Montag touched the volume control in the wall and the announcer
was speechless.
"Millie?" He paused. "This is your house as well as mine. I feel it's
only fair that I tell you something now. I should have told you before,
but I wasn't even admitting it to myself. I have something I want you to
see, something I've put away and hid during the past year, now and
again, once in a while, I didn't know why, but I did it and I never told
you."
He took hold of a straight-backed chair and moved it slowly and
steadily into the hall near the front door and climbed up on it and stood
for a moment like a statue on a pedestal, his wife standing under him,
waiting. Then he reached up and pulled back the grille of the airconditioning system and reached far back inside to the right and
moved still another sliding sheet of

62

metal and took out a book. Without looking at it he dropped it to the
floor. He put his hand back up and took out two books and moved his
hand down and dropped the two books to the floor. He kept moving
his hand and dropping books, small ones, fairly large ones, yellow, red,
green ones. When he was done he looked down upon some twenty
books lying at his wife's feet.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't really think. But now it looks as if
we're in this together."
Mildred backed away as if she were suddenly confronted by a
pack of mice that had come up out of the floor. He could hear her
breathing rapidly and her face was paled out and her eyes were
fastened wide. She said his name over, twice, three times. Then
moaning, she ran forward, seized a book and ran toward the kitchen
incinerator.
He caught her, shrieking. He held her and she tried to fight away
from him, scratching.
"No, Millie, no! Wait! Stop it, will you? You don't know . . . stop it!"
He slapped her face, he grabbed her again and shook her.
She said his name and began to cry.
"Millie! "' he said. "Listen. Give me a second, will you? We can't do
anything. We can't burn these. I want to look at them, at least look at
them once. Then if what the Captain says is true, we'll burn them
together, believe me, we'll burn them together. You must help me." He
looked down into her face and took hold of her chin and held her
firmly. He was looking not only at her, but for himself and what he
must do, in her face. "Whether we like this or not, we're in it. I've never
asked for much from you in all these years, but I ask it now, I plead for
it. We've got to start somewhere here, figuring out why we're in such a
mess, you and the medicine at night, and the car, and me and my work.
We're heading right for the cliff, Millie. God, I don't want to

63

go over. This isn't going to be easy. We haven't anything to go on, but
maybe we can piece it out and figure it and help each other. I need you
so much right now, I can't tell you. If you love me at all you'll put up
with this, twenty-four, forty-eight hours, that's all I ask, then it'll be
over. I promise, I swear! And if there is something here, just one little
thing out of a whole mess of things, maybe we can pass it on to
someone else."
She wasn't fighting any more, so he let her go. She sagged away
from him and slid down the wall, and sat on the floor looking at the
books. Her foot touched one and she saw this and pulled her foot away.
"That woman, the other night, Millie, you weren't there. You didn't
see her face. And Clarisse. You never talked to her. I talked to her. And
men like Beatty are afraid of her. I can't understand it. Why should they
be so afraid of someone like her? But I kept putting her alongside the
firemen in the house last night, and I suddenly realized I didn't like
them at all, and I didn't like myself at all any more. And I thought
maybe it would be best if the firemen themselves were burnt."
"Guy! "
The front door voice called softly:
"Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs.
Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here."
Softly.
They turned to stare at the door and the books toppled
everywhere, everywhere in heaps.
"Beatty!" said Mildred.
"It can't be him."
"He's come back!" she whispered.
The front door voice called again softly. "Someone here . . ."
"We won't answer." Montag lay back against the wall and

64

then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books,
bewilderedly, with his thumb, his forefinger. He was shivering and he
wanted above all to shove the books up through the ventilator again,
but he knew he could not face Beatty again. He crouched and then he
sat and the voice of the front door spoke again, more insistently.
Montag picked a single small volume from the floor. "Where do we
begin?" He opened the book half-way and peered at it. "We begin by
beginning, I guess."
"He'll come in," said Mildred, "and burn us and the books!"
The front door voice faded at last. There was a silence. Montag felt
the presence of someone beyond the door, waiting, listening. Then the
footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn.
"Let's see what this is," said Montag.
He spoke the words haltingly and with a terrible self-consciousness. He
read a dozen pages here and there and came at last to this:
" `It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several
times suffered death rather than submit to break eggs at the smaller
end."'
Mildred sat across the hall from him. "What does it mean? It
doesn't mean anything! The Captain was right! "
"Here now," said Montag. "We'll start over again, at the
beginning."

65

66

PART II
THE SIEVE AND THE SAND
They read the long afternoon through, while the cold November rain
fell from the sky upon the quiet house. They sat in the hall because the
parlor was so empty and grey-looking without its walls lit with orange
and yellow confetti and sky-rockets and women in gold-mesh dresses
and men in black velvet pulling one-hundred-pound rabbits from silver
hats. The parlor was dead and Mildred kept peering in at it with a
blank expression as Montag paced the floor and came back and
squatted down and read a page as many as ten times, aloud.
" `We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed.
As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it
run over, so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes
the heart run over.'"
Montag sat listening to the rain.

67

"Is that what it was in the girl next door? I've tried so hard to
figure."
"She's dead. Let's talk about someone alive, for goodness' sake."
Montag did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along
the hall to the kitchen, where he stood a long .time watching the rain
hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the grey light,
waiting for the tremble to subside.
He opened another book.
" `That favorite subject, Myself."'
He squinted at the wall. " `The favorite subject, Myself."'
"I understand that one," said Mildred.
"But Clarisse's favorite subject wasn't herself. It was everyone else,
and me. She was the first person in a good many years I've really liked.
She was the first person I can remember who looked straight at me as if
I counted." He lifted the two books. "These men have been dead a long
time, but I know their words point, one way or another, to Clarisse."
Outside the front door, in the rain, a faint scratching.
Montag froze. He saw Mildred thrust herself back to the wall and
gasp.
"Someone--the door--why doesn't the door-voice tell us--"
"I shut it off."
Under the door-sill, a slow, probing sniff, an exhalation of electric
steam.
Mildred laughed. "It's only a dog, that's what! You want me to
shoo him away?"
"Stay where you are!"
Silence. The cold rain falling. And the smell of blue electricity
blowing under the locked door.
"Let's get back to work," said Montag quietly.

68

Mildred kicked at a book. "Books aren't people. You read and I
look around, but there isn't anybody!"
He stared at the parlor that was dead and gray as the waters of an
ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun.
"Now," said Mildred, "my `family' is people. They tell me things; I
laugh, they laugh! And the colors!"
"Yes, I know."
"And besides, if Captain Beatty knew about those books--" She
thought about it. Her face grew amazed and then horrified. "He might
come and bum the house and the `family.' That's awful! Think of our
investment. Why should I read? What for?"
"What for! Why!" said Montag. "I saw the damnedest snake in the
world the other night. It was dead but it was alive. It could see but it
couldn't see. You want to see that snake? It's at Emergency Hospital
where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you!
Would you like to go and check their file? Maybe you'd look under
Guy Montag or maybe under Fear or War. Would you like to go to that
house that burnt last night? And rake ashes for the bones of the woman
who set fire to her own house! What about Clarisse McClellan, where
do we look for her? The morgue! Listen!"
The bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house,
gasping, murmuring, whistling like an immense, invisible fan, circling
in emptiness.
"Jesus God," said Montag. "Every hour so many damn things in
the sky! How in hell did those bombers get up there every single
second of our lives! Why doesn't someone want to talk about it? We've
started and won two atomic wars since 1960. Is it because we're having
so much fun at home we've forgotten the world? Is it because we're so
rich and the rest of the world's

69

so poor and we just don't care if they are? I've heard rumors; the world
is starving, but we're well-fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we
play? Is that why we're hated so much? I've heard the rumors about
hate, too, once in a long while, over the years. Do you know why? I
don't, that's sure! Maybe the books can get us half out of the cave. They
just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes! I don't
hear those idiot bastards in your parlor talking about it. God, Millie,
don't you see? An hour a day, two hours, with these books, and
maybe..."
The telephone rang. Mildred snatched the phone.
"Ann!" She laughed. "Yes, the White Clown's on tonight!"
Montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down.
"Montag," he said, "you're really stupid. Where do we go from here? Do
we turn the books in, forget it?" He opened the book to read over
Mildred's laughter.
Poor Millie, he thought. Poor Montag, it's mud to you, too. But
where do you get help, where do you find a teacher this late?
Hold on. He shut his eyes. Yes, of course. Again he found himself
thinking of the green park a year ago. The thought had been with him
many times recently, but now he remembered how it was that day in
the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide
something, quickly in his coat .
... The old man leapt up as if to run. And Montag said, "Wait ! "
"I haven't done anything! " cried the old man trembling.
"No one said you did."
They had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a
moment, and then Montag talked about the weather, and then the old
man responded with a pale voice. It was a strange quiet meeting. The
old man admitted to being a retired English professor who had been
thrown out upon the world forty years

70

ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and
patronage. His name was Faber, and when he finally lost his fear of
Montag, he talked in a cadenced voice, looking at the sky and the trees
and the green park, and when an hour had passed he said something to
Montag and Montag sensed it was a rhyme less poem. Then the old
man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was
a poem, too. Faber held his hand over his left coat-pocket and spoke
these words gently, and Montag knew if he reached out, he might pull
a book of poetry from the man's coat. But he did not reach out. His.
hands stayed on his knees, numbed and useless. "I don't talk things, sir,"
said Faber. "I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I'm alive."
That was all there was to it, really. An hour of monologue, a poem,
a comment, and then without even acknowledging the fact that Montag
was a fireman, Faber with a certain trembling, wrote his address on a
slip of paper. "For your file," he said, "in case you decide to be angry
with me."
"I'm not angry," Montag said, surprised.
Mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall.
Montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his filewallet to the heading: FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS (?). Faber's name
was there. He hadn't turned it in and he hadn't erased it.
He dialed the call on a secondary phone. The phone on the far end
of the line called Faber's name a dozen times before the professor
answered in a faint voice. Montag identified himself and was met with
a lengthy silence. "Yes, Mr. Montag?"
"Professor Faber, I have a rather odd question to ask. How many
copies of the Bible are left in this country?"
"I don't know what you're talking about! "

71

"I want to know if there are any copies left at all."
"This is some sort of a trap! I can't talk to just anyone on the
phone!"
"How many copies of Shakespeare and Plato?"
"None ! You know as well as I do. None!"
Faber hung up.
Montag put down the phone. None. A thing he knew of course
from the firehouse listings. But somehow he had wanted to hear it from
Faber himself.
In the hall Mildred's face was suffused with excitement. "Well, the
ladies are coming over!"
Montag showed her a book. "This is the Old and New Testament,
and-"
"Don't start that again!"
"It might be the last copy in this part of the world."
"You've got to hand it back tonight, don't you know? Captain
Beatty knows you've got it, doesn't he?"
"I don't think he knows which book I stole. But how do I choose a
substitute? Do I turn in Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Thoreau? Which is least
valuable? If I pick a substitute and Beatty does know which book I
stole, he'll guess we've an entire library here!"
Mildred's mouth twitched. "See what you're doing? You'll ruin us!
Who's more important, me or that Bible?" She was beginning to shriek
now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat.
He could hear Beatty's voice. "Sit down, Montag. Watch.
Delicately, like the petals of a flower. Light the first page, light the
second page. Each becomes a black butterfly. Beautiful, eh? Light the
third page from the second and so on, chain-smoking, chapter by
chapter, all the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, all
the second-hand notions and time-worn phi-

72

losophies." There sat Beatty, perspiring gently, the floor littered with
swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm.
Mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started. Montag was
not listening. "There's only one thing to do," he said. "Some time before
tonight when I give the book to Beatty, I've got to have a duplicate
made."
"You'll be here for the White Clown tonight, and the ladies coming
over?" cried Mildred.
Montag stopped at the door, with his back turned. "Millie?"
A silence "What?"
"Millie? Does the White Clown love you?"
No answer.
"Millie, does--" He licked his lips. "Does your `family' love you,
love you very much, love you with all their heart
and soul, Millie?"
He felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck.
"Why'd you ask a silly question like that?"
He felt he wanted to cry, but nothing would happen to his eyes or
his mouth.
"If you see that dog outside," said Mildred, "give him a kick for
me."
He hesitated, listening at the door. He opened it and stepped out.
The rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky. The
street and the lawn and the porch were empty. He let his breath go in a
great sigh.
He slammed the door.
He was on the subway.
I'm numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin in my
face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill-bottle in the dark, like
kicking a buried mine.

73

The numbness will go away, he thought. It'll take time, but I'll do
it, or Faber will do it for me. Someone somewhere will give me back the
old face and the old hands the way they were. Even the smile, he
thought, the old burnt-in smile, that's gone. I'm lost without it.
The subway fled past him, cream-tile, jet-black, cream-tile, jetblack, numerals and darkness, more darkness and the total adding
itself.
Once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the
middle of the blue and hot summer day, trying to fill a sieve with sand,
because some cruel cousin had said, "Fill this sieve and you'll get a
dime!" `And the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through with a hot
whispering. His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was
empty. Seated there in the midst of July, without a sound, he felt the
tears move down his cheeks.
Now as the vacuum-underground rushed him through the dead
cellars of town, jolting him, he remembered the terrible logic of that
sieve, and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the Bible
open. There were people in the suction train but he held the book in his
hands and the silly thought came to him, if you read fast and read all,
maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve. But he read and the
words fell through, and he thought, in a few hours, there will be Beatty,
and here will be me handing this over, so no phrase must escape me,
each line must be memorized. I will myself to do it.
He clenched the book in his fists.
Trumpets blared.
"Denham's Dentrifice."
Shut up, thought Montag. Consider the lilies of the field.
"Denham's Dentifrice."

74

They toil not"Denham's--"
Consider the lilies of the field, shut up, shut up.
"Dentifrice ! "
He tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt them as if he
were blind, he picked at the shape of the individual letters, not
blinking.
"Denham's. Spelled : D-E-N-"
They toil not, neither do they . . .
A fierce whisper of hot sand through empty sieve.
"Denham's does it!"
Consider the lilies, the lilies, the lilies...
"Denham's dental detergent."
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!" It was a plea, a cry so terrible that
Montag found himself on his feet, the shocked inhabitants of the loud
car staring, moving back from this man with the insane, gorged face,
the gibbering, dry mouth, the flapping book in his fist. The people who
had been sitting a moment before, tapping their feet to the rhythm of
Denham's Dentifrice, Denham's Dandy Dental Detergent, Denham's
Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice, one two, one two three, one two, one
two three. The people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the
words Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice. The train radio vomited upon
Montag, in retaliation, a great ton-load of music made of tin, copper,
silver, chromium, and brass. The people were pounded into
submission; they did not run, there was no place to run; the great airtrain fell down its shaft in the earth.
"Lilies of the field."
"Denham's."
"Lilies, I said!"
The people stared.

75

"Call the guard."
"The man's off--"
"Knoll View!"
The train hissed to its stop.
"Knoll View!" A cry.
"Denham's." A whisper.
Montag's mouth barely moved. "Lilies..."
The train door whistled open. Montag stood. The door gasped,
started shut. Only then did he leap past the other passengers,
screaming in his mind, plunge through the slicing door only in time.
He ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels, ignoring the
escalators, because he wanted to feel his feet-move, arms swing, lungs
clench, unclench, feel his throat go raw with air. A voice drifted after
him, "Denham's Denham's Denham's," the train hissed like a snake. The
train vanished in its hole.
"Who is it?"
"Montag out here."
"What do you want?"
"Let me in."
"I haven't done anything!"
"I'm alone, dammit! "
"You swear it?"
"I swear!"
The front door opened slowly. Faber peered out, looking very old
in the light and very fragile and very much afraid. The old man looked
as if he had not been out of the house in years. He and the white plaster
walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his
mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded,
with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the
book under Montag's

76

arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile.
Slowly, his fear went.
"I'm sorry. One has to be careful."
He looked at the book under Montag's arm and could not stop. "So
it's true."
Montag stepped inside. The door shut.
"Sit down." Faber backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish
if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood
open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn
upon a desk-top. Montag had only a glimpse, before Faber, seeing
Montag's attention diverted, turned quickly and shut the bedroom door
and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand. His gaze returned
unsteadily to Montag, who was now seated with the book in his lap.
"The book-where did you-?"
"I stole it."
Faber, for the first time, raised his eyes and looked directly into
Montag's face. "You're brave."
"No," said Montag. "My wife's dying. A friend of mine's already
dead. Someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than
twenty-four hours ago. You're the only one I knew might help me. To
see. To see. ."
Faber's hands itched on his knees. "May I?"
"Sorry." Montag gave him the book.
"It's been a long time. I'm not a religious man. But it's been a long
time." Faber turned the pages, stopping here and there to read. "It's as
good as I remember. Lord, how they've changed it- in our `parlors'
these days. Christ is one of the `family' now. I often wonder it God
recognizes His own son the way we've dressed him up, or is it dressed
him down? He's a regular peppermint stick now, all sugar-crystal and
saccharine when he isn't making

77

veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper
absolutely needs." Faber sniffed the book. "Do you know that books
smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land? I loved to smell
them when I was a boy. Lord, there were a lot of lovely books once,
before we let them go." Faber turned the pages. "Mr. Montag, you are
looking at a coward. I saw the way things were going, a long time back.
I said nothing. I'm one of the innocents who could have spoken up and
out when no one would listen to the `guilty,' but I did not speak and
thus became guilty myself. And when finally they set the structure to
burn the books, using the, firemen, I grunted a few times and subsided,
for there were no others grunting or yelling with me, by then. Now, it's
too late." Faber closed the Bible. "Well--suppose you tell me why you
came here?"
"Nobody listens any more. I can't talk to the walls because they're
yelling at me. I can't talk to my wife; she listens to the walls. I just want
someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough,
it'll make sense. And I want you to teach me to understand what I
read."
Faber examined Montag's thin, blue-jowled face. "How did you get
shaken up? What knocked the torch out of your hands?"
"I don't know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we
aren't happy. Something's missing. I looked around. The only thing I
positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or twelve
years. So I thought books might help."
"You're a hopeless romantic," said Faber. "It would be funny if it
were not serious. It's not books you need, it's some of the things that
once were in books. The same things could be in the `parlor families'
today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected
through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at
all you're looking for! Take it where you

78

can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old
friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only
one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid
we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is
only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe
together into one garment for us. Of course you couldn't know this, of
course you still can't understand what I mean when I say all this. You
are intuitively right, that's what counts. Three things are missing.
"Number one: Do you know why books such as this are so
important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality
mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This
book can go under the microscope. You'd find life under the glass,
streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more
truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet
of paper, the more `literary' you are. That's my definition, anyway.
Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The
mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and
leave her for the flies.
"So now do you see why books are hated and feared? They show the
pores in the face of life. The comfortable people want only wax moon
faces, poreless, hairless, expressionless. We are living in a time when
flowers are trying to live on flowers, instead of growing on good rain
and black loam. Even fireworks, for all their prettiness, come from the
chemistry of the earth. Yet somehow we think we can grow, feeding on
flowers and fireworks, without completing the cycle back to reality. Do
you know the legend of Hercules and Antaeus, the giant wrestler,
whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth.
But when he was held, rootless, in mid-air, by Hercules, he perished
easily. If there isn't something in that legend for us

79

today, in this city, in our time, then I am completely insane. Well, there
we have the first thing I said we needed. Quality, texture of
information."
"And the second?"
"Leisure."
"Oh, but we've plenty of off-hours."
"Off-hours, yes. But time to think? If you're not driving a hundred
miles an hour, at a clip where you can't think of anything else but the
danger, then you're playing some game or sitting in some room where
you can't argue with the fourwall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real.'
It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it
in. It must be, right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its
own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'"
"Only the 'family' is 'people.'"
"I beg your pardon?"
"My wife says books aren't 'real.'"
"Thank God for that. You can shut them, say, 'Hold on a moment.'
You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that
encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlor? It grows you any
shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and
is the truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my
knowledge and skepticism, I have never been able to argue with a onehundred-piece symphony orchestra, full color, three dimensions, and I
being in and part of those incredible parlors. As you see, my parlor is
nothing but four plaster walls. And here." He held out two small
rubber plugs. "For my ears when I ride the subway-jets."
"Denham's Dentifrice; they toil not, neither do they spin," said
Montag, eyes shut. "Where do we go from here? Would books help us?"

80

"Only if the third necessary thing could be given us. Number one,
as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And
number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn
from the inter-action of the first two. And I hardly think a very old man
and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game..."
"I can get books."
"You're running a risk."
"That's the good part of dying; when you've nothing to lose, you
run any risk you want."
"There, you've said an interesting thing," laughed Faber, "without
having read it!"
"Are things like that in books. But it came off the top of my mind!"
"All the better. You didn't fancy it up for me or anyone, even
yourself."
Montag leaned forward. "This afternoon I thought that if it turned
out that books were worth while, we might get a press and print some
extra copies--"
"We?"
"You and I"
"Oh, no!" Faber sat up.
"But let me tell you my plan---"
"If you insist on telling me, I must ask you to leave."
"But aren't you interested?"
"Not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for
my trouble. The only way I could possibly listen to you would be if
somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt. Now if you
suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in
firemen's houses all over the country, so that seeds of suspicion would
be sown among these arsonists, bravo, I'd say!"

81

"Plant the books, turn in an alarm, and see the firemen's houses
bum, is that what you mean?"
Faber raised his brows and looked at Montag as if he were seeing a
new man. "I was joking."
"If you thought it would be a plan worth trying, I'd have to take
your word it would help."
"You can't guarantee things like that! After all, when we had all
the books we needed, we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to
jump off. But we do need a breather. We do need knowledge. And
perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off.
The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are. They're
Caesar's praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the
avenue, `Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.' Most of us can't rush
around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we
haven't time, money or that many friends. The things you're looking
for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will
ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Don't ask for
guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person,
machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at
least die knowing you were headed for shore."
Faber got up and began to pace the room.
"Well?" asked Montag.
"You're absolutely serious?"
"Absolutely."
"It's an insidious plan, if I do say so myself." Faber glanced
nervously at his bedroom door. "To see the firehouses burn across the
land, destroyed as hotbeds of treason. The salamander devours his tail!
Ho, God! "
"I've a list of firemen's residences everywhere. With some sort of
underground--"

82

"Can't trust people, that's the dirty part. You and I and who else
will set the fires?"
"Aren't there professors like yourself, former writers, historians,
linguists . . .?"
"Dead or ancient."
"The older the better; they'll go unnoticed. You know dozens,
admit it!"
"Oh, there are many actors alone who haven't acted Pirandello or
Shaw or Shakespeare for years because their plays are too aware of the
world. We could use their anger. And we could use the honest rage of
those historians who haven't written a line for forty years. True, we
might form classes in thinking and reading."
"Yes!"
"But that would just nibble the edges. The whole culture's shot
through. The skeleton needs melting and re-shaping. Good God, it isn't
as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago.
Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped
reading of its own accord. You firemen provide a circus now and then
at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze,
but it's a small sideshow indeed, and hardly necessary to keep things in
line. So few want to be rebels any more. And out of those few, most,
like myself, scare easily. Can you dance faster than the White Clown,
shout louder than `Mr. Gimmick' and the parlor `families'? If you can,
you'll win your way, Montag. In any event, you're a fool. People are
having fun."
"Committing suicide! Murdering!"
A bomber flight had been moving east all the time they talked, and
only now did the two men stop and listen, feeling the great jet sound
tremble inside themselves.

83

"Patience, Montag. Let the war turn off the `families.' Our
civilization is flinging itself to pieces. Stand back from the centrifuge."
"There has to be someone ready when it blows up."
"What? Men quoting Milton? Saying, I remember Sophocles?
Reminding the survivors that man has his good side, too? They will
only gather up their stones to hurl at each other. Montag, go home. Go
to bed. Why waste your final hours racing about your cage denying
you're a squirrel?"
"Then you don't care any more?"
"I care so much I'm sick."
"And you won't help me?"
"Good night, good night."
Montag's hands picked up the Bible. He saw what his hands had
done and he looked surprised.
"Would you like to own this?"
Faber said, "I'd give my right arm."
Montag stood there and waited for the next thing to happen. His
hands, by themselves, like two men working together, began to rip the
pages from the book. The hands tore the flyleaf and then the first and
then the second page.
"Idiot, what're you doing!" Faber sprang up, as if he had been
struck. He fell, against Montag. Montag warded him off and let his
hands continue. Six more pages fell to the floor. He picked them up and
wadded the paper under Faber's gaze.
"Don't, oh, don't!" said the old man.
"Who can stop me? I'm a fireman. I can bum you!"
The old man stood looking at him. "You wouldn't."
"I could!"
"The book. Don't tear it any more." Faber sank into a chair, his face
very white, his mouth trembling. "Don't make me feel any more tired.
What do you want?"

84

"I need you to teach me."
"All right, all right."
Montag put the book down. He began to unwad the crumpled
paper and flatten it out as the old man watched tiredly.
Faber shook his head as if he were waking up.
"Montag, have you some money?"
"Some. Four, five hundred dollars. Why?"
"Bring it. I know a man who printed our college paper half a
century ago. That was the year I came to class at the start of the new
semester and found only one student to sign up for Drama from
Aeschylus to O'Neill. You see? How like a beautiful statue of ice it was,
melting in the sun. I remember the newspapers dying like huge moths.
No one wanted them back. No one missed them. And the Government,
seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about
passionate lips and the fist in the stomach, circled the situation with
your fire-eaters. So, Montag, there's this unemployed printer. We might
start a few books, and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us
the push we need. A few bombs and the `families' in the walls of all the
houses, like harlequin rats, will shut up! In silence, our stage-whisper
might carry."
They both stood looking at the book on the table.
"I've tried to remember," said Montag. "But, hell, it's gone when I
turn my head. God, how I want something to say to the Captain. He's
read enough so he has all the answers, or seems to have. His voice is
like butter. I'm afraid he'll talk me back the way I was. Only a week
ago, pumping a kerosene hose, I thought: God, what fun!"
The old man nodded. "Those who don't build must burn. It's as
old as history and juvenile delinquents."
"So that's what I am."

85

"There's some of it in all of us."
Montag moved towards the front door. "Can you help me in any
way tonight, with the Fire Captain? I need an umbrella to keep off the
rain. I'm so damned afraid I'll drown if he gets me again."
The old man said nothing, but glanced once more nervously, at his
bedroom. Montag caught the glance. "Well?"
The old man took a deep breath, held it, and let it out. He took
another, eyes closed, his mouth tight, and at last exhaled. "Montag..."
The old man turned at last and said, "Come along. I would
actually have let you walk right out of my house. I am a cowardly old
fool."
Faber opened the bedroom door and led Montag into a small
chamber where stood a table upon which a number of metal tools lay
among a welter of microscopic wire-hairs, tiny coils, bobbins, and
crystals.
"What's this?" asked Montag.
"Proof of my terrible cowardice. I've lived alone so many years,
throwing images on walls with my imagination. Fiddling with
electronics, radio-transmission, has been my hobby. My cowardice is of
such a passion, complementing the revolutionary spirit that lives in its
shadow, I was forced to design this."
He picked up a small green-metal object no larger than a .22 bullet.
"I paid for all this-how? Playing the stock-market, of course, the
last refuge in the world for the dangerous intellectual out of a job. Well,
I played the market and built all this and I've waited. I've waited,
trembling, half a lifetime for someone to speak to me. I dared speak to
no one. That day in the park when we sat together, I knew that some
day you might drop by, with

86

fire or friendship, it was hard to guess. I've had this little item ready for
months. But I almost let you go, I'm that afraid!"
"It looks like a Seashell radio."
"And something more! It listens! If you put it in your ear, Montag, I
can sit comfortably home, warming my frightened bones, and hear and
analyse the firemen's world, find its weaknesses, without danger. I'm
the Queen Bee, safe in the hive. You will be the drone, the travelling
ear. Eventually, I could put out ears into all parts of the city, with
various men, listening and evaluating. If the drones die, I'm still safe at
home, tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum
of chance. See how safe I play it, how contemptible I am?"
Montag placed the green bullet in his ear. The old man inserted a
similar object in his own ear and moved his lips.
"Montag! "
The voice was in Montag's head.
"I hear you!"
The old man laughed. "You're coming over fine, too!" Faber
whispered, but the voice in Montag's head was clear. "Go to the
firehouse when it's time. I'll be with you. Let's listen to this Captain
Beatty together. He could be one of us. God knows. I'll give you things
to say. We'll give him a good show. Do you hate me for this electronic
cowardice of mine? Here I am sending you out into the night, while I
stay behind the lines with my damned ears listening for you to get your
head chopped off."
"We all do what we do," said Montag. He put the Bible in the old
man's hands. "Here. I'll chance turning in a substitute. Tomorrow--"
"I'll see the unemployed printer, yes; that much I can do."
"Good night, Professor."
"Not good night. I'll be with you the rest of the night, a vin-

87

egar gnat tickling your ear when you need me. But good night and
good luck, anyway."
The door opened and shut. Montag was in the dark street again,
looking at the world.
You could feel the war getting ready in the sky that night. The way
the clouds moved aside and came back, and the way the stars looked, a
million of them swimming between the clouds, like the enemy discs,
and the feeling that the sky might fall upon the city and turn it to chalk
dust, and the moon go up in red fire; that was how the night felt.
Montag walked from the subway with the money in his pocket (he
had visited the bank which was open all night and every night with
robot tellers in attendance) and as he walked he was listening to the
Seashell radio in one car... "We have mobilized a million men. Quick
victory is ours if the war comes .. .." Music flooded over the voice
quickly and it was gone.
"Ten million men mobilized," Faber's voice whispered in his other
ear. "But say one million. It's happier."
"Faber?"
"Yes?"
"I'm not thinking. I'm just doing like I'm told, like always. You said
get the money and I got it. I didn't really think of it myself. When do I
start working things out on my own?"
"You've started already, by saying what you just said. You'll have
to take me on faith."
"I took the others on faith ! "
"Yes, and look where we're headed. You'll have to travel blind for
a while. Here's my arm to hold on to."
"I don't want to change sides and just be told what to do. There's
no reason to change if I do that."

88

"You're wise already!"
Montag felt his feet moving him on the sidewalk toward his house.
"Keep talking."
"Would you like me to read? I'll read so you can remember. I go to
bed only five hours a night. Nothing to do. So if you like; I'll read you
to sleep nights. They say you retain knowledge even when you're
sleeping, if someone whispers it in your ear."
"Yes."
"Here." Far away across town in the night, the faintest whisper of a
turned page. "The Book of Job."
The moon rose in the sky as Montag walked, his lips moving just a
trifle.
He was eating a light supper at nine in the evening when the front door
cried out in the hall and Mildred ran from the parlour like a native
fleeing an eruption of Vesuvius. Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came
through the front door and vanished into the volcano's mouth with
martinis in their hands: Montag stopped eating. They were like a
monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw
their Cheshire Cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and
now they were screaming at each other above the din.
Montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his
mouth.
"Doesn't everyone look nice!"
"Nice."
"You look fine, Millie! "
"Fine."
"Everyone looks swell."
"Swell!
"Montag stood watching them.

89

"Patience," whispered Faber.
"I shouldn't be here," whispered Montag, almost to himself. "I
should be on my way back to you with the money!"
"Tomorrow's time enough. Careful!"
"Isn't this show wonderful?" cried Mildred.
"Wonderful!"
On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice
simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought Montag,
insanely. In the other walls an X-ray of the same woman revealed the
contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her
delightful stomach! Abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into
the clouds, it plunged into a lime-green sea where blue fish ate red and
yellow fish. A minute later, Three White Cartoon Clowns chopped off
each other's limbs to the accompaniment of immense incoming tides of
laughter. Two minutes more and the room whipped out of town to the
jet cars wildly circling an arena, bashing and backing up and bashing
each other again. Montag saw a number of bodies fly in the air.
"Millie, did you see that?"
"I saw it, I saw it!"
Montag reached inside the parlour wall and pulled the main
switch. The images drained away, as if the water had been let out from
a gigantic crystal bowl of hysterical fish.
The three women turned slowly and looked with unconcealed
irritation and then dislike at Montag.
"When do you suppose the war will start?" he said. "I notice your
husbands aren't here tonight?"
"Oh, they come and go, come and go," said Mrs. Phelps. "In again
out again Finnegan, the Army called Pete yesterday. He'll be back next
week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and
everyone home. That's what the Army said.

90

Quick war. Pete was called yesterday and they said he'd be, back next
week. Quick..."
The three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty
mud-coloured walls.
"I'm not worried," said Mrs. Phelps. "I'll let Pete do all the
worrying." She giggled. "I'll let old Pete do all the worrying. Not me.
I'm not worried."
"It's always someone else's husband dies, they say."
"I've heard that, too. I've never known any dead man killed in a
war. Killed jumping off buildings, yes, like Gloria's husband last week,
but from wars? No."
"Not from wars," said Mrs. Phelps. "Anyway, Pete and I always
said, no tears, nothing like that. It's our third marriage each and we're
independent. Be independent, we always said. He said, if I get killed
off, you just go right ahead and don't cry, but get married again, and
don't think of me."
"That reminds me," said Mildred. "Did you see that Clara Dove
five-minute romance last night in your wall? Well, it was all about this
woman who--"
Montag said nothing but stood looking at the women's faces as he
had once looked at the faces of saints in a strange church he had
entered when he was a child. The faces of those enameled creatures
meant nothing to him, though he talked to them and stood in that
church for a long time, trying to be of that religion, trying to know
what that religion was, trying to get enough of the raw incense and
special dust of the place into his lungs and thus into his blood to feel
touched and concerned by the meaning of the colorful men and women
with the porcelain eyes and the blood-ruby lips. But there was nothing,
nothing; it was a stroll through another store, and his currency strange
and unusable there, and his passion cold, even when he touched the

91

wood and plaster and clay. So it was now, in his own parlor, with these
women twisting in their chairs under his gaze, lighting cigarettes,
blowing smoke, touching their sun-fired hair and examining their
blazing fingernails as if they had caught fire from his look. Their faces
grew haunted with silence. They leaned forward at the sound of
Montag's swallowing his final bite of food. They listened to his feverish
breathing. The three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows
of sleeping giants now, empty of dreams. Montag felt that if you
touched these three staring brows you would feel a fine salt sweat on
your finger-tips. The perspiration gathered with the silence and the
sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were
burning with tension. Any moment they might hiss a long sputtering
hiss and explode.
Montag moved his lips.
"Let's talk."
The women jerked and stared.
"How're your children, Mrs. Phelps?" he asked.
"You know I haven't any! No one in his right mind, the Good Lord
knows; would have children!" said Mrs. Phelps, not quite sure why she
was angry with this man.
"I wouldn't say that," said Mrs. Bowles. "I've had two children by
Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The
world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they
sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. Two Caesarians tamed the
trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians aren't necessary; you've
got the, hips for it, everything's normal, but I insisted."
"Caesarians or not, children are ruinous; you're out of your mind,"
said Mrs. Phelps.
"I plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. I put up

92

with them when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all.
You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn the switch. It's like washing
clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid." Mrs. Bowles tittered. "They'd
just as soon kick as kiss me. Thank God, I can kick back! "
The women showed their tongues, laughing.
Mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that Montag was still in the
doorway, clapped her hands. "Let's talk politics, to please Guy!"
"Sounds fine," said Mrs. Bowles. "I voted last election, same as
everyone, and I laid it on the line for President Noble. I think he's one
of the nicest-looking men who ever became president."
"Oh, but the man they ran against him!"
"He wasn't much, was he? Kind of small and homely and he didn't
shave too close or comb his hair very well."
"What possessed the 'Outs' to run him? You just don't go running
a little short man like that against a tall man. Besides -he mumbled.
Half the time I couldn't hear a word he said. And the words I did hear I
didn't understand!"
"Fat, too, and didn't dress to hide it. No wonder the landslide was
for Winston Noble. Even their names helped. Compare Winston Noble
to Hubert Hoag for ten seconds and you can almost figure the results."
"Damn it!" cried Montag. "What do you know about Hoag and
Noble?"
"Why, they were right in that parlor wall, not six months ago. One
was always picking his nose; it drove me wild."
"Well, Mr. Montag," said Mrs. Phelps, "do you want us to vote for
a man like that?"
Mildred beamed. "You just run away from the door, Guy, and
don't make us nervous."

93

But Montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his
hand.
"Guy!"
"Damn it all, damn it all, damn it!"
"What've you got there; isn't that a book? I thought that all special
training these days was done by film." Mrs. Phelps blinked. "You
reading up on fireman theory?"
"Theory, hell," said Montag. "It's poetry."
"Montag." A whisper.
"Leave me alone!" Montag felt himself turning in a great circling
roar and buzz and hum.
"Montag, hold on, don't..."
"Did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about
monsters? Oh God, the way they jabber about people and their own
children and themselves and the way they talk about their husbands
and the way they talk about war, dammit, I stand here and I can't
believe it!"
"I didn't say a single word about any war, I'll have you know," said
Mrs, Phelps.
"As for poetry, I hate it," said Mrs. Bowles.
"Have you ever read any?"
"Montag," Faber's voice scraped away at him. "You'll ruin
everything. Shut up, you fool!"
"All three women were on their feet.
"Sit down!"
They sat.
"I'm going home," quavered Mrs. Bowles.
"Montag, Montag, please, in the name of God, what are you up
to?" pleaded Faber.
"Why don't you just read us one of those poems from your little
book," Mrs. Phelps nodded. "I think that'd he very interesting."

94

"That's not right," wailed Mrs. Bowles. "We can't do that!"
"Well, look at Mr. Montag, he wants to, I know he does. And if we
listen nice, Mr. Montag will be happy and then maybe we can go on
and do something else." She glanced nervously at the long emptiness of
the walls enclosing them.
"Montag, go through with this and I'll cut off, I'll leave." The beetle
jabbed his ear. "What good is this, what'll you prove?"
"Scare hell out of them, that's what, scare the living daylights out!"
Mildred looked at the empty air. "Now Guy, just who are you
talking to?"
A silver needle pierced his brain. "Montag, listen, only one way
out, play it as a joke, cover up, pretend you aren't mad at all. Then-walk
to your wall-incinerator, and throw the book in!"
Mildred had already anticipated this in a quavery voice. "Ladies,
once a year, every fireman's allowed to bring one book home, from the
old days, to show his family how silly it all was, how nervous that sort
of thing can make you, how crazy. Guy's surprise tonight is to read you
one sample to show how mixed-up things were, so none of us will ever
have to bother our little old heads about that junk again, isn't that right,
darling?"
He crushed the book in his fists. "Say `yes’."
His mouth moved like Faber's:
"Yes."
Mildred snatched the book with a laugh. "Here! Read this one. No,
I take it back. Here's that real funny one you read out loud today.
Ladies, you won't understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go
ahead, Guy, that page, dear."
He looked at the opened page.
A fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. "Read."

95

"What's the title, dear?"
"Dover Beach." His mouth was numb.
"Now read in a nice clear voice and go slow."
The room was blazing hot, he was all fire, he was all coldness; they
sat in the middle of an empty desert with three chairs and him
standing, swaying, and him waiting for Mrs. Phelps to stop
straightening her dress hem and Mrs. Bowles to take her fingers away
from her hair. Then he began to read in a low, stumbling voice that
grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and his voice went out
across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting
women there in the great hot emptiness:
The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.
The chairs creaked under the three women. Montag finished it out:
Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,

96

Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.
Mrs. Phelps was crying.
The others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow
very loud as her face squeezed itself out of shape. They sat, not
touching her, bewildered by her display. She sobbed uncontrollably.
Montag himself was stunned and shaken.
"Sh, sh," said Mildred. "You're all right, Clara, now, Clara, snap out
of it! Clara, what's wrong?"
"I-I,", sobbed Mrs. Phelps, "don't know, don't know, I just don't
know, oh oh..."
Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. "You see? I knew it,
that's what I wanted to prove! I knew it would happen! I've always
said, poetry and tears, poetry and suicide and crying and awful
feelings, poetry and sickness; all that mush! Now I've had it proved to
me. You're nasty, Mr. Montag, you're nasty! "
Faber said, "Now..."
Montag felt himself turn and walk to the wall-slot and drop the
book in through the brass notch to the waiting flames.
"Silly words, silly words, silly awful hurting words," said Mrs.
Bowles. "Why do people want to hurt people? Not enough hurt in the
world, you've got to tease people with stuff like that ! "
"Clara, now, Clara," begged Mildred, pulling her arm. "Come on,
let's be cheery, you turn the `family' on, now. Go ahead. Let's laugh and
be happy, now, stop crying, we'll have a party!"
"No," said Mrs. Bowles. "I'm trotting right straight home. You want
to visit my house and `family,' well and good. But I won't come in this
fireman's crazy house again in my lifetime! "

97

"Go home." Montag fixed his eyes upon her, quietly. "Go home
and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband
killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, go home
and think of the dozen abortions you've had, go home and think of that
and your damn Caesarian sections, too, and your children who hate
your guts! Go home and think how it all happened and what did you
ever do to stop it? Go home, go home!" he yelled. "Before I knock you
down and kick you out of the door!"
Doors slammed and the house was empty. Montag stood alone in
the winter weather, with the parlour walls the colour of dirty snow.
In the bathroom, water ran. He heard Mildred shake the sleeping
tablets into her hand.
"Fool, Montag, fool, fool, oh God you silly fool..."
"Shut up!" He pulled the green bullet from his ear and jammed it
into his pocket.
It sizzled faintly,". . . fool . . . fool . . ."
He searched the house and found the books where Mildred had
stacked them behind the refrigerator. Some were missing and he knew
that she had started on her own slow process of dispersing the
dynamite in her house, stick by stick. But he was not angry now, only
exhausted and bewildered with himself. He carried the books into the
backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight
only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning.
He went back through the house. "Mildred?" He called at the door
of the darkened bedroom. There was no sound.
Outside, crossing the lawn, on his way to work, he tried not to see
how completely dark and deserted Clarisse McClellan's house was....

98

On the way downtown he was so completely alone with his
terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and
goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the
night. Already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known
Faber a lifetime. Now he knew that he was two people, that he was
above all Montag, who knew nothing, who did not even know himself
a fool, but only suspected it. And he knew that he was also the old man
who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one
end of the night city to the other on one long sickening gasp of motion.
In the days to follow, and in the nights when there was no moon and in
the nights when there was a very bright moon shining on the earth, the
old man would go on with this talking and this talking, drop by drop,
stone by stone, flake by flake. His mind would well over at last and he
would not be Montag any more, this the old man told him, assured
him, promised him. He would be Montag-plus-Faber, fire plus water,
and then, one day, after everything had mixed and simmered and
worked away in silence, there would be neither fire nor water, but
wine. Out of two separate and opposite things, a third. And one day he
would look back upon the fool and know the fool. Even now he could
feel the start of the long journey, the leave-taking, the going away from
the self he had been.
It was good listening to the beetle hum, the sleepy mosquito buzz
and delicate filigree murmur of the old man's voice at first scolding him
and then consoling him in the late hour of night as he emerged from
the steaming subway toward the firehouse world.
"Pity, Montag, pity. Don't haggle and nag them; you were so
recently of them yourself. They are so confident that they will run on
for ever. But they won't run on. They don't know that this is

99

all one huge big blazing meteor that makes a pretty fire in space, but
that some day it'll have to hit. They see only the blaze, the pretty fire, as
you saw it.
"Montag, old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanutbrittle bones, have no right to criticize. Yet you almost killed things at
the start. Watch it! I'm with you, remember that. I understand how it
happened. I must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. God,
how young I felt! But now-I want you to feel old, I want a little of my
cowardice to be distilled in you tonight. The next few hours, when you
see Captain Beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for you, let me
feel the situation out. Survival is our ticket. Forget the poor, silly
women ...."
"I made them unhappier than they have been in years, I think,"
said Montag. "It shocked me to see Mrs. Phelps cry. Maybe they're
right, maybe it's best not to face things, to run, have fun. I don't know. I
feel guilty--"
"No, you mustn't! If there were no war, if there was peace in the
world, I'd say fine, have fun! But, Montag, you mustn't go back to being
just a fireman. All isn't well with the world."
Montag perspired.
"Montag, you listening?"
"My feet," said Montag. "I can't move them. I feel so damn silly.
My feet won't move!"
"Listen. Easy now," said the old man gently. "I know, I know.
You're afraid of making mistakes. Don't be. Mistakes can be profited
by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in people's faces.
They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument
had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. If you hide your
ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn. Now, pick up
your feet, into the firehouse with you! We're twins, we're not alone any
more, we're not separated out

100

in different parlors, with no contact between. If you need help when
Beatty pries at you, I'll be sitting right here in your eardrum making
notes!"
Montag felt his right foot, then his left foot, move.
"Old man," he said, "stay with me."
The Mechanical Hound was gone. Its kennel was empty and the
firehouse stood all about in plaster silence and the orange Salamander
slept with its kerosene in its belly and the fire throwers crossed upon its
flanks and Montag came in through the silence and touched the brass
pole and slid up in the dark air, looking back at the deserted kennel, his
heart beating, pausing, beating. Faber was a grey moth asleep in his
ear, for the moment.
Beatty stood near the drop-hole waiting, but with his back turned
as if he were not waiting.
"Well," he said to the men playing cards, "here comes a very
strange beast which in all tongues is called a fool."
He put his hand to one side, palm up, for a gift. Montag put the
book in it. Without even glancing at the title, Beatty tossed the book
into the trash-basket and lit a cigarette. "`Who are a little wise, the best
fools be.' Welcome back, Montag. I hope you'll be staying, with us, now
that your fever is done and your sickness over. Sit in for a hand of
poker?"
They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beatty's sight, Montag felt the
guilt of his hands. His fingers were like ferrets that had done some evil
and now never rested, always stirred and picked and hid in pockets,
moving from under Beatty's alcohol-flame stare. If Beatty so much as
breathed on them, Montag felt that his hands might wither, turn over
on their sides, and never be shocked to life again; they would be buried
the rest of his life in his coat-sleeves, forgotten. For these were the
hands that had acted on their own, no part of him, here was where the
con-

101

science first manifested itself to snatch books, dart off with job and
Ruth and Willie Shakespeare, and now, in the firehouse, these hands
seemed gloved with blood.
Twice in half an hour, Montag had to rise from the game and go to
the latrine to wash his hands. When he came back he hid his hands
under the table.
Beatty laughed. "Let's have your hands in sight, Montag.
Not that we don't trust you, understand, but--"
They all laughed.
"Well," said Beatty, "the crisis is past and all is well, the sheep
returns to the fold. We're all sheep who have strayed at times. Truth is
truth, to the end of reckoning, we've cried. They are never alone that
are accompanied with noble thoughts, we've shouted to ourselves.
`Sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge,' Sir Philip Sidney said. But
on the other hand: `Words are like leaves and where they most abound,
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.' Alexander Pope. What do
you think of that?"
"I don't know."
"Careful," whispered Faber, living in another world, far away.
"Or this? 'A little learning is a dangerous thing. Drink deep, or
taste not the Pierian spring; There shallow draughts intoxicate the
brain, and drinking largely sobers us again.' Pope. Same Essay. Where
does that put you?"
Montag bit his lip.
"I'll tell you," said Beatty, smiling at his cards. "That made you for
a little while a drunkard. Read a few lines and off you go over the cliff.
Bang, you're ready to blow up the world, chop off heads, knock down
women and children, destroy authority. I know, I've been through it
all."
"I'm all right," said Montag, nervously.

102

"Stop blushing. I'm not needling, really I'm not. Do you know, I
had a dream an hour ago. I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream
you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered
with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I
said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said `Knowledge is more than
equivalent to force!' And I said, `Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy,
that "He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.'"
Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!"
"Don't listen," whispered Faber. "He's trying to confuse. He's
slippery. Watch out!"
Beatty chuckled. "And you said, quoting, `Truth will come to light,
murder will not be hid long!' And I cried in good humour, 'Oh God, he
speaks only of his horse!' And `The Devil can cite Scripture for his
purpose.' And you yelled, 'This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than
of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school!' And I whispered gently, 'The
dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.' And you screamed,
'Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!' And I said, patting your
hand, 'What, do I give you trench mouth?' And you shrieked,
'Knowledge is power!' and 'A dwarf on a giant's shoulders of the
furthest of the two!' and I summed my side up with rare serenity in,
'The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for
a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr.
Valery once said.'"
Montag's head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on
brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He
wanted to yell, "No! shut up, you're confusing things, stop it!" Beatty's
graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist.
"God, what a pulse! I've got you going, have I, Montag. Jesus God,
your pulse sounds like the day after the war. Every-

103

thing but sirens and bells! Shall I talk some more? I like your look of
panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I speak them all. A kind of excellent
dumb discourse, Willie!"
"Montag, hold on! " The moth brushed Montag's ear. "He's
muddying the waters!"
"Oh, you were scared silly," said Beatty, "for I was doing a terrible
thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand,
on every point! What traitors books can be! You think they're backing
you up, and they turn on you. Others can use them, too, and there you
are, lost in the middle of the moor, in a great welter of nouns and verbs
and adjectives. And at the very end of my dream, along I came with the
Salamander and said, Going my way? And you got in and we drove
back to the firehouse in beatific silence, all -dwindled away to peace."
Beatty let Montag's wrist go, let the hand slump limply on the table.
"All's well that is well in the end."
Silence. Montag sat like a carved white stone. The echo of the final
hammer on his skull died slowly away into the black cavern where
Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And then when the startled
dust had settled down about Montag's mind, Faber began, softly, "All
right, he's had his say. You must take it in. I'll say my say, too, in the
next few hours. And you'll take it in. And you'll try to judge them and
make your decision as to which way to jump, or fall. But I want it to be
your decision, not mine, and not the Captain's. But remember that the
Captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom,
the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny
of the majority. We all have our harps to play. And it's up to you now
to know with which ear you'll listen."
Montag opened his mouth to answer Faber and was saved this
error in the presence of others when the station bell rang.

104

The alarm-voice in the ceiling chanted. There was a tacking-tacking
sound as the alarm-report telephone typed out the address across the
room. Captain Beatty, his poker cards in one pink hand, walked with
exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the address when
the report was finished. He glanced perfunctorily at it, and shoved it in
his pocket. He came back and sat down. The others looked at him.
"It can wait exactly forty seconds while I take all the money away
from you," said Beatty, happily.
Montag put his cards down.
"Tired, Montag? Going out of this game?"
"Yes."
"Hold on. Well, come to think of it, we can finish this hand later.
Just leave your cards face down and hustle the equipment. On the
double now." And Beatty rose up again. "Montag, you don't look well?
I'd hate to think you were coming down with another fever..."
"I'll be all right."
"You'll be fine. This is a special case. Come on, jump for it!"
They leaped into the air and clutched the brass pole as if it were
the last vantage point above a tidal wave passing below, and then the
brass pole, to their dismay slid them down into darkness, into the blast
and cough and suction of the gaseous dragon roaring to life!
"Hey!"
They rounded a corner in thunder and siren, with concussion of
tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery
brass tank, like the food in the stomach of a giant; with Montag's
fingers jolting off the silver rail, swinging into cold space, with the
wind tearing his hair back from his head, with the wind whistling in
his teeth, and him all the while

105

thinking of the women, the chaff women in his parlor tonight, with the
kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and his silly
damned reading of a book to them. How like trying to put out fires
with water-pistols, how senseless and insane. One rage turned in for
another. One anger displacing another. When would he stop being
entirely mad and be quiet, be very quiet indeed?
"Here we go!"
Montag looked up. Beatty never drove, but he was driving tonight,
slamming the Salamander around corners, leaning forward high on the
driver's throne, his massive black slicker flapping out behind so that he
seemed a great black bat flying above the engine, over the brass
numbers, taking the full wind.
"Here we go to keep the world happy, Montag !"
Beatty's pink, phosphorescent cheeks glimmered in the high
darkness, and he was smiling furiously.
"Here we are!"
The Salamander boomed to a halt, throwing men off in slips and
clumsy hops. Montag stood fixing his raw eyes to the cold bright rail
under his clenched fingers.
I can't do it, he thought. How can I go at this new assignment, how
can I go on burning things? I can't go in this place.
Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had rushed, was at
Montag's elbow. "All right, Montag?"
The men ran like cripples in their clumsy boots, as quietly as
spiders.
At last Montag raised his eyes and turned. Beatty was watching
his face.
"Something the matter, Montag?"
"Why," said Montag slowly, "we've stopped in front of my house."

106

PART III
BURNING BRIGHT
Lights flicked on and house-doors opened all down the street, to watch
the carnival set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with dry satisfaction,
the other with disbelief, at the house before them, this main ring in
which torches would be juggled and fire eaten.
"Well," said Beatty, "now you did it. Old Montag wanted to fly near
the sun and now that he's burnt his damn wings, he wonders why.
Didn't I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?"
Montag's face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head
turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door, set in its bright
borders of flowers.
Beatty snorted. "Oh, no! You weren't fooled by that little idiot's
routine, now, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell!
It's all in her file. I'll be damned. I've hit the bull’s-eye. Look at the sick
look on your face. A few grass-blades and the quarters of the moon.
What trash. What good did she ever do with all that?"

107

Montag sat on the cold fender of the Dragon, moving his head half
an inch to the left, half an inch to the right, left, right, left right, left ....
"She saw everything. She didn't do anything to anyone. She just let
them alone."
"Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didn't she? One of those
damn do-gooders with their shocked, holier-than-thou silences, their
one talent making others feel guilty. God damn, they rise like the
midnight sun to sweat you in your bed!"
The front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, running,
one suitcase held with a dream-like clenching rigidity in her fist, as a
beetle-taxi hissed to the curb.
"Mildred!"
She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her
mouth gone, without lipstick.
"Mildred, you didn't put in the alarm!"
She shoved the valise in the waiting beetle, climbed in, and sat
mumbling, "Poor family, poor family, oh everything gone, everything,
everything gone now ...."
Beatty grabbed Montag's shoulder as the beetle blasted away and
hit seventy miles an hour, far down the street, gone.
There was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of
warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms. Montag drifted about as if
still another incomprehensible storm had turned him, to see Stoneman
and Black wielding axes, shattering window-panes to provide crossventilation.
The brush of a death's-head moth against a cold black screen.
"Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What is happening
"This is happening to me," said Montag.
"What a dreadful surprise," said Beatty. "For everyone nowadays
knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen

108

to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no
responsibilities. Except that there are. But let's not talk about them, eh?
By the time the consequences catch up with you, it's too late, isn't it,
Montag?"
"Montag, can you get away, run?" asked Faber.
Montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then
the night grasses. Beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange
flame drew his fascinated gaze.
"What is there about fire that's so lovely? No matter what age we
are, what draws us to it?" Beatty blew out the flame and lit it again. "It's
perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or
almost perpetual motion. If you let it go on, it'd burn our lifetimes out.
What is fire? It's a mystery. Scientists give us gobbledegook about
friction and molecules. But they don't really know. Its real beauty is
that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets too
burdensome, then into the furnace with it. Now, Montag, you're a
burden. And fire will lift you off my shoulders, clean, quick, sure;
nothing to rot later. Antibiotic, aesthetic, practical."
Montag stood looking in now at this queer house, made strange by
the hour of the night, by murmuring neighbour voices, by littered glass,
and there on the floor, their covers torn off and spilled out like swanfeathers, the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth
bothering with, for these were nothing but black type and yellowed
paper, and raveled binding.
Mildred, of course. She must have watched him hide the books in
the garden and brought them back in. Mildred. Mildred.
"I want you to do this job all by your lonesome, Montag. Not with
kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your
house, your clean-up."

109

"Montag, can't you run, get away!"
"No!" cried Montag helplessly. "The Hound! Because of the
Hound!"
Faber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was meant for him, heard.
"Yes, the Hound's somewhere about the neighborhood, so don't try
anything. Ready?"
"Ready." Montag snapped the safety-catch on the flamethrower.
"Fire!"
A great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and
knock them against the wall. He stepped into the bedroom and fired
twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering whisper, with
more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to
contain. He burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because
he wanted to change everything, the chairs, the tables, and in the
dining-room the silverware and plastic dishes, everything that showed
that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who
would forget him tomorrow, who had gone and quite forgotten him
already, listening to her Seashell radio pour in on her and in on her as
she rode across town, alone. And as before, it was good to burn, he felt
himself gush out in the fire, snatch, rend, rip in half with flame, and put
away the senseless problem. If there was no solution, well then now
there was no problem, either. Fire was best for everything!
"The books, Montag!"
The books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze
with red and yellow feathers.
And then he came to the parlor where the great idiot monsters lay
asleep with their white thoughts and their snowy dreams. And he shot
a bolt at each of the three blank walls and

110

the vacuum hissed out at him. The emptiness made an even emptier
whistle, a senseless scream. He tried to think about the vacuum upon
which the nothingness had performed, but he could not. He held his
breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs. He cut off its terrible
emptiness, drew back, and gave the entire room a gift of one huge
bright yellow flower of burning. The fire-proof plastic sheath on
everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame.
"When you're quite finished," said Beatty behind him. "You're
under arrest."
The house fell in red coals and black ash. It bedded itself down in
sleepy pink-grey cinders and a smoke plume blew over it, rising and
waving slowly back and forth in the sky. It was three-thirty in the
morning. The crowd drew back into the houses; the great tents of the
circus had slumped into charcoal and rubble and the show was well
over.
Montag stood with the flame-thrower in his limp hands, great
islands of perspiration drenching his armpits, his face smeared with
soot. The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces
illuminated faintly by the smoldering foundation.
Montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his
thought together.
"Was it my wife turned in the alarm?"
Beatty nodded. "But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I
let ride. One way or the other, you'd have got it. It was pretty silly,
quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly
damn snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks he's the Lord
of all Creation. You think you can walk on water with your books.
Well, the world can get by just fine

111

without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir
the slime with my little finger, you'll drown ! "
Montag could not move. A great earthquake had come with fire
and leveled the house and Mildred was under there somewhere and his
entire life under there and he could not move. The earthquake was still
shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there, his
knees half-bent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and
outrage, letting Beatty hit him without raising a hand.
"Montag, you idiot, Montag, you damn fool; why did you really do
it?"
Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was running with his
mind, he was gone, leaving this dead soot-covered body to sway in
front of another raving fool.
"Montag, get out of there! " said Faber.
Montag listened.
Beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back.
The green bullet in which Faber's voice whispered and cried, fell to the
sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He held it half in, half out of
his ear.
Montag heard the distant voice calling, "Montag, you all right?"
Beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket.
"Well--so there's more here than I thought. I saw you tilt your head,
listening. First I thought you had a Seashell. But when you turned
clever later, I wondered. We'll trace this and drop it on your friend."
"No!" said Montag.
He twitched the safety catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced
instantly at Montag's fingers and his eyes widened the faintest bit.
Montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced

112

to his hands to see what new thing they had done. Thinking back later
he could never decide whether the hands or Beatty's reaction to the
hands gave him the final push toward murder. The last rolling thunder
of the avalanche stoned down about his ears, not touching him.
Beatty grinned his most charming grin. "Well, that's one way to get
an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your
speech. Speech away. What'll it be this time? Why don't you belch
Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? `There is no terror, Cassius, in
your threats, for I am arm'd so strong in honesty that they pass by me
as an idle wind, which I respect not!' How's that? Go ahead now, you
second-hand litterateur, pull the trigger." He took one step toward
Montag.
Montag only said, "We never burned right..."
"Hand it over, Guy," said Beatty with a fixed smile.
And then he was a shrieking blaze, a jumping, sprawling,
gibbering mannikin, no longer human or known, all writhing flame on
the lawn as Montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on him.
There was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a red-hot
stove, a bubbling and frothing as if salt had been poured over a
monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction and a boiling over
of yellow foam. Montag shut his eyes, shouted, shouted, and fought to
get his hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound. Beatty
flopped over and over and over, and at last twisted in on himself like a
charred wax doll and lay silent.
The other two firemen did not move.
Montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flamethrower. "Turn around!"
They turned, their faces like blanched meat, streaming sweat; he
beat their heads, knocking off their helmets and bringing them down
on themselves. They fell and lay without moving.

113

The blowing of a single autumn leaf.
He turned and the Mechanical Hound was there.
It was half across the lawn, coming from the shadows, moving
with such drifting ease that it was like a single solid cloud of black-grey
smoke blown at him in silence.
It made a single last leap into the air, coming down at Montag
from a good three feet over his head, its spidered legs reaching, the
procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth. Montag caught it
with a bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of
yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new
covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten feet back
against the bole of a tree, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it
scrabble and seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before
the fire snapped the Hound up in the air, burst its metal bones at the
joints, and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour like a
skyrocket fastened to the street. Montag lay watching the dead-alive
thing fiddle the air and die. Even now it seemed to want to get back at
him and finish the injection which was now working through the flesh
of his leg. He felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled
back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car
hurtling by at ninety miles an hour. He was afraid to
get up, afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all, with an
anaesthetized leg. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a
numbness....
And now...?
The street empty, the house burnt like an ancient bit of stagescenery, the other homes dark, the Hound here, Beatty there, the three
other firemen another place, and the Salamander . . . ? He gazed at the
immense engine. That would have to go, too.
Well, he thought, let's see how badly off you are. On your feet
now. Easy, easy . . . there.

114

He stood and he had only one leg. The other was like a chunk of
burnt pine-log he was carrying along as a penance for some obscure
sin. When he put his weight on it, a shower of silver needles gushed up
the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on!
Come on, you, you can't stay here!
A few house-lights were going on again down the street, whether
from the incidents just passed, or because of the abnormal silence
following the fight, Montag did not know. He hobbled around the
ruins, seizing at his bad leg when it lagged, talking and whimpering
and shouting directions at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work
for him now when it was vital. He heard a number of people crying out
in the darkness and shouting. He reached the back yard and the alley.
Beatty, he thought, you're not a problem now. You always said, don't
face a problem, bum it. Well, now I've done both. Good-bye, Captain.
And he stumbled along the alley in the dark.
A shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he
thought, you're a fool, a damn fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful
idiot, a damn idiot, and a fool, a damn fool; look at the mess and
where's the mop, look at the mess, and what do you do? Pride, damn it,
and temper, and you've junked it all, at the very start you vomit on
everyone and on yourself. But everything at once, but everything one
on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, everything. No
excuse, though, no excuse. A fool, a damn fool, go give yourself up!
No, we'll save what we can, we'll do what there is left to do. If we
have to burn, let's take a few more with us. Here!
He remembered the books and turned back. Just on the off chance.
He found a few books where he had left them, near the

115

garden fence. Mildred, God bless her, had missed a few. Four books
still lay hidden where he had put them. Voices were wailing in the
night and flashbeams swirled about. Other Salamanders were roaring
their engines far away, and police sirens were cutting their way across
town with their sirens.
Montag took the four remaining books and hopped, jolted,
hopped his way down the alley and suddenly fell as if his head had
been cut off and only his body lay there. Something inside had jerked
him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay where he had fallen and
sobbed, his legs folded, his face pressed blindly to the gravel.
Beatty wanted to die.
In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty
had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save
himself, just stood there, joking, needling, thought Montag, and the
thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air.
How strange, strange, to want to die so much that you let a man walk
around armed and then instead of shutting up and staying alive, you
go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them
mad, and then ....
At a distance, running feet.
Montag sat up. Let's get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you
just can't sit! But he was still crying and that had to be finished. It was
going away now. He hadn't wanted to kill anyone, not even Beatty. His
flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He
gagged. He saw Beatty, a torch, not moving, fluttering out on the grass.
He bit at his knuckles. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh God, sorry ....
He tried to piece it all together, to go back to the normal pattern of
life a few short days ago before the sieve and the sand, Denham's
Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and

116

excursions, too much for a few short days, too much, indeed, for a
lifetime.
Feet ran in the far end of the alley.
"Get up!" he told himself. "Damn it, get up!" he said to the leg, and
stood. The pains were spikes driven in the kneecap and then only
darning needles and then only common, ordinary safety pins, and after
he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps, filling his hand with
slivers from the board fence, the prickling was like someone blowing a
spray of scalding water on that leg. And the leg was at last his own leg
again. He had been afraid that running might break the loose ankle.
Now, sucking all the night into his open mouth, and blowing it out
pale, with all the blackness left heavily inside himself, he set out in a
steady jogging pace. He carried the books in his hands.
He thought of Faber.
Faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name
or identity now. He had burnt Faber, too. He felt so suddenly shocked
by this that he felt Faber was really dead, baked like a roach in that
small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was
now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.
You must remember, burn them or they'll burn you, he thought.
Right now it's as simple as that.
He searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other
pocket he found the usual Seashell upon which the city was talking to
itself in the cold black morning.
"Police Alert. Wanted: Fugitive in city. Has committed murder and
crimes against the State. Name: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman.
Last seen . . ."
He ran steadily for six blocks, in the alley, and then the alley
opened out on to a wide empty thoroughfare ten lanes wide. It

117

seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high
white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too
wide, it was too open. It was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him
to run across, easily seen in the blazing illumination, easily caught,
easily shot down.
The Seashell hummed in his ear.
"... watch for a man running ... watch for the running man . . .
watch for a man alone, on foot . . . watch..."
Montag pulled back into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas
station, a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there, and two silver
beetles pulling in to fill up. Now he must be clean and presentable if he
wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly across that wide boulevard. It
would give him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed
his hair before he went on his way to get where . . . ?
Yes, he thought, where am I running?
Nowhere. There was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really.
Except Faber. And then he realized that he was indeed, running toward
Faber's house, instinctively. But Faber couldn't hide him; it would be
suicide even to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway,
for a few short minutes. Faber's would be the place where he might
refuel his fast draining belief in his own ability to survive. He just
wanted to know that there was a man like Faber in the world. He
wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body
shelled in another body. And some of the money must be left with
Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on his way. Perhaps he
could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near
the highways, in the fields and hills.
A great whirling whisper made him look to the sky.
The police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed

118

someone had blown the grey head off a dry dandelion flower. Two
dozen of them flurried, wavering, indecisive, three miles off, like
butterflies puzzled by autumn, and then they were plummeting down
to land, one by one, here, there, softly kneading the streets where,
turned back to beetles, they shrieked along the boulevards or, as
suddenly, leapt back into the sir, continuing their search.
And here was the gas station, its attendants busy now with customers.
Approaching from the rear, Montag entered the men's washroom.
Through the aluminum wall he heard a radio voice saying, "War has
been declared." The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the
beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines,
the gas, the money owed. Montag stood trying to make himself feel the
shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing would happen.
The war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file, an
hour, two hours from now.
He washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry, making
little sound. He came out of the washroom and shut the door carefully
and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the edge of the
empty boulevard.
There it lay, a game for him to win, a vast bowling alley in the cool
morning. The boulevard was as clean as the surface of an arena two
minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims and certain
unknown killers. The air over and above the vast concrete river
trembled with the warmth of Montag's body alone; it was incredible
how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to
vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it. And now
he must begin his little walk.

119

Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep
breath. His lungs were like burning brooms in his chest. His mouth was
sucked dry from running. His throat tasted of bloody iron and there
was rusted steel in his feet.
What about those lights there? Once you started walking you'd
have to gauge how fast those beetles could make it down here. Well,
how far was it to the other curb? It seemed like a hundred yards.
Probably not a hundred, but figure for that anyway, figure that with
him going very slowly, at a nice stroll, it might take as much as thirty
seconds, forty seconds to walk all the way. The beetles? Once started,
they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds. So,
even if halfway across he started to run . . . ?
He put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right.
He walked on the empty avenue.
Even if the street were entirely empty, of course, you couldn't be
sure of a safe crossing, for a car could appear suddenly over the rise
four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had taken a
dozen breaths.
He decided not to count his steps. He looked neither to left nor
right. The light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and
revealing as the midday sun and just as hot.
He listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks
away on his right. Its movable headlights jerked back and forth
suddenly, and caught at Montag.
Keep going.
Montag faltered, got a grip on the books, and forced himself not to
freeze. Instinctively he took a few quick, running steps then talked out
loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again. He was now half across
the street, but the roar from the beetle's engines whined higher as it put
on speed.

120

The police, of course. They see me. But slow now; slow, quiet,
don't turn, don't look, don't seem concerned. Walk, that's it, walls,
walk.
The beetle was rushing. The beetle was roaring. The beetle raised
its speed. The beetle was whining. The beetle was in high thunder. The
beetle came skimming. The beetle came in a single whistling trajectory,
fired from an invisible rifle. It was up to 120 mph. It was up to 130 at
least. Montag clamped his jaws. The heat of the racing headlights burnt
his cheeks, it seemed, and jittered his eye-lids and flushed the sour
sweat out all over his body.
He began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he
broke and just ran. He put out his legs as far as they would go and
down and then far out again and down and back and out and down
and back. God ! God! He dropped a book, broke pace, almost turned,
changed his mind, plunged on, yelling in concrete emptiness, the beetle
scuttling after its running food, two hundred, one hundred feet away,
ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag gasping, flailing his hands, legs up
down out, up down out, closer, closer, hooting, calling, his eyes burnt
white now as his head jerked about to confront the flashing glare, now
the beetle was swallowed in its own light, now it was nothing but a
torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. Now-almost on top of
him!
He stumbled and fell.
I'm done! It's over!
But the falling made a difference. An instant before reaching him
the wild beetle cut and swerved out. It was gone. Montag lay flat, his
head down. Wisps of laughter trailed back to him with the blue exhaust
from the beetle.
His right hand was extended above him, flat. Across the extreme
tip of his middle finger, he saw now as he lifted that hand,

121

a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tire had touched in
passing. He looked at that black line with disbelief, getting to his feet.
That wasn't the police, he thought.
He looked down the boulevard. It was clear now. A carful of
children, all ages, God knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling,
yelling, hurrahing, had seen a man, a very extraordinary sight, a man
strolling, a rarity, and simply said, "Let's get him," not knowing he was
the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a number of children out for a long
night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours, their
faces icy with wind, and coming home or not coming at dawn, alive or
not alive, that made the adventure.
They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still
torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek. For no
reason at all in the world they would have killed me.
He walked toward the far curb telling each foot to go and keep
going. Somehow he had picked up the spilled books; he didn't
remember bending or touching them. He kept moving them from hand
to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure.
I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse?
He stopped and his mind said it again, very loud.
I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse!
He wanted to run after them yelling.
His eyes watered.
The thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that
car, seeing Montag down, instinctively considered the probability that
running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and
spill them out. If Montag had remained an upright target. . . ?

122

Montag gasped.
Far down the boulevard, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed,
spun about on two wheels, and was now racing back, slanting over on
the wrong side of the street, picking up speed.
But Montag was gone, hidden in the safety of the dark alley for
which he had set out on a long journey, an hour or was it a minute,
ago? He stood shivering in the night, looking back out as the beetle ran
by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue, whirling laughter in
the air all about it, gone.
Further on, as Montag moved in darkness, he could see the
helicopters falling, falling, like the first flakes of snow in the long
winter to come....
The house was silent.
Montag approached from the rear, creeping through a thick nightmoistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass. He touched the
screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved across the porch,
listening.
Mrs. Black, are you asleep in there? he thought. This isn't good,
but your husband did it to others and never asked and never wondered
and never worried. And now since you're a fireman's wife, it's your
house and your turn, for all the houses your husband burned and the
people he hurt without thinking. .
The house did not reply.
He hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again
to the alley and looked back and the house was still dark and quiet,
sleeping.
On his way across town, with the helicopters fluttering like torn
bits of paper in the sky, he phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth
outside a store that was closed for the night. Then he stood in the cold
night air, waiting and at a distance he heard

123

the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders coming, coming to
bum Mr. Black's house while he was away at work, to make his wife
stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in
upon the fire. But now, she was still asleep.
Good night, Mrs. Black, he thought. "Faber! "
Another rap, a whisper, and a long waiting. Then, after a minute, a
small light flickered inside Faber's small house. After another pause,
the back door opened.
They stood looking at each other in the half-light, Faber and
Montag, as if each did not believe in the other's existence. Then Faber
moved and put out his hand and grabbed Montag and moved him in
and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The
sirens were wailing off in the morning distance. He came in and shut
the door.
Montag said, "I've been a fool all down the line. I can't stay long.
I'm on my way God knows where."
"At least you were a fool about the right things," said Faber. "I
thought you were dead. The audio-capsule I gave you--"
"Burnt."
"I heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was
nothing. I almost came out looking for you."
"The captain's dead. He found the audio-capsule, he heard your
voice, he was going to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower."
Faber sat down and did not speak for a time.
"My God, how did this happen?" said Montag. "It was only the
other night everything was fine and the next thing I know I'm
drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I
can't breathe. There's Beatty dead, and he was my friend

124

once, and there's Millie gone, I thought she was my wife, but now I
don't know. And the house all burnt. And my job gone and myself on
the run, and I planted a book in a fireman's house on the way. Good
Christ, the things I've done in a single week! "
"You did what you had to do. It was coming on for a long time."
"Yes, I believe that, if there's nothing else I believe. It saved itself
up to happen. I could feel it for a long time, I was saving something up,
I went around doing one thing and feeling another. God, it was all
there. It's a wonder it didn't show on me, like fat. And now here I am,
messing up your life. They might follow me here."
"I feel alive for the first time in years," said Faber. "I feel I'm doing
what I should have done a lifetime ago. For a little while I'm not afraid.
Maybe it's because I'm doing the right thing at last. Maybe it's because
I've done a rash thing and don't want to look the coward to you. I
suppose I'll have to do even more violent things, exposing myself so I
won't fall down on the job and turn scared again. What are your
plans?"
"To keep running."
"You know the war's on?"
"I heard."
"God, isn't it funny?" said the old man. "It seems so remote because
we have our own troubles."
"I haven't had time to think." Montag drew out a hundred dollars.
"I want this to stay with you, use it any way that'll help when I'm
gone."
"But-- "
"I might be dead by noon; use this."
Faber nodded. "You'd better head for the river if you can, follow
along it, and if you can hit the old railroad lines going

125

out into the country, follow them. Even though practically everything's
airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the rails are
still there, rusting. I've heard there are still hobo camps all across the
country, here and there; walking camps they call them, and if you keep
walking far enough and keep an eye peeled, they say there's lots of old
Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of
them are wanted and hunted in the cities. They survive, I guess. There
aren't many of them, and I guess the Government's never considered
them a great enough danger to go in and track them down. You might
hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in St. Louis, I'm
leaving on the five a.m. bus this morning, to see a retired printer there,
I'm getting out into the open myself, at last. The money will be put to
good use. Thanks and God bless you. Do you want to sleep a few
minutes?"
"I'd better run."
"Let's check."
He took Montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture
frame aside, revealing a television screen the size of a postal card. "I
always wanted something very small, something I could talk to,
something I could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary,
nothing that could shout me down, nothing monstrous big. So, you
see." He snapped it on. "Montag," the TV set said, and lit up. "M-O-NT-A-G." The name was spelled out by the voice. "Guy Montag. Still
running. Police helicopters are up. A new Mechanical Hound has been
brought from another district.. ."
Montag and Faber looked at each other.
“--Mechanical Hound never fails. Never since its first use in
tracking quarry has this incredible invention made a mistake. Tonight,
this network is proud to have the opportunity to fol-

126

low the Hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the
target--"
Faber poured two glasses of whisky. "We'll need these."
They drank.
"--nose so sensitive the Mechanical Hound can remember and
identify ten thousand odor-indexes on ten thousand men without resetting! "
Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house, at the
walls, the door, the doorknob, and the chair where Montag now sat.
Montag saw the look. They both looked quickly about the house and
Montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track
himself and his nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he
had made in the air of the room and the sweat of his hand hung from
the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the jewels of a small
chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about everything, he was
a luminous cloud, a ghost that made breathing once more impossible.
He saw Faber stop up his own breath for fear of drawing that ghost
into his own body, perhaps, being contaminated with the phantom
exhalations and odors of a running man.
"The Mechanical Hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of
the Burning!"
And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd,
and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came
the helicopter like a grotesque flower.
So they must have their game out, thought Montag. The circus
must go on, even with war beginning within the hour....
He watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed
so remote and no part of him; it was a play apart and separate,
wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. That's all for me,
you thought, that's all taking place just for me, by God.

127

If he wished, he could linger here, in comfort, and follow the entire
hunt on through its swift. phases, down alleys across streets, over
empty running avenues, crossing lots and playgrounds, with pauses
here or there for the necessary commercials, up other alleys to the
burning house of Mr. and Mrs. Black, and so on finally to this house
with Faber and himself seated, drinking, while the Electric Hound
snuffed down the last trail, silent as a drift of death itself, skidded to a
halt outside that window there. Then, if he wished, Montag might rise,
walk to the window, keep one eye on the TV screen, open the window,
lean out, look back, and see himself dramatized, described, made over,
standing there, limned in the bright small television screen from
outside, a drama to be watched objectively, knowing that in other
parlors he was large as life, in full color, dimensionally perfect! And if
he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself, an instant before
oblivion, being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlorsitters who had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the
frantic sirening of their living-room walls to come watch the big game,
the hunt, the one-man carnival.
Would he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in
view of ten or twenty or thirty million people, mightn't he sum up his
entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would
stay with them long after the. Hound had turned, clenching him in its
metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera
remained stationary, watching the creature dwindle in the distance--a
splendid fade-out! What could he say in a single word, a few words,
that would sear all their faces and wake them up?
"There," whispered Faber.
Out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine,

128

not animal, not dead, not alive, glowing with a pale green luminosity. It
stood near the smoking ruins of Montag's house and the men brought
his discarded flame-thrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of
the Hound. There was a whirring, clicking, humming.
Montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink.
"It's time. I'm sorry about this:"
"About what? Me? My house? I deserve everything. Run, for God's
sake. Perhaps I can delay them here--"
"Wait. There's no use your being discovered. When I leave, burn
the spread of this bed, that I touched. Burn the chair in the living room,
in your wall incinerator. Wipe down the furniture with alcohol, wipe
the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlor. Turn the airconditioning on full in all the rooms and spray with moth-spray if you
have it. Then, turn on your lawn sprinklers as high as they'll go and
hose off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the trail in here,
anyway.”
Faber shook his hand. "I'll tend to it. Good luck. If we're both in
good health, next week, the week after, get in touch. General Delivery,
St. Louis. I'm sorry there's no way I can go with you this time, by earphone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited.
You see, I never thought I would use it. What a silly old man. No
thought there. Stupid, stupid. So I haven't another green bullet, the
right kind, to put in your head. Go now!"
"One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest
clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, some old sneakers and
socks . . . ."
Faber was gone and back in a minute. They sealed the cardboard
valise with clear tape. "To keep the ancient odor of Mr. Faber in, of
course," said Faber sweating at the job.

129

Montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky. "I don't
want that Hound picking up two odors at once. May I take this
whiskey. I'll need it later. Christ I hope this works!"
They shook hands again and, going out of the door, they glanced
at the TV. The Hound was on its way, followed by hovering helicopter
cameras, silently, silently, sniffing the great night wind. It was running
down the first alley.
"Goodbye ! "
And Montag was out the back door lightly, running with the halfempty valise. Behind him he heard the lawn-sprinkling system jump
up, filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then with a steady
pour all about, washing on the sidewalks, and draining into the alley.
He carried a few drops of this rain with him on his face. He thought he
heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasn't certain.
He ran very fast away from the house, down toward the river.
Montag ran.
He could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and
swift, like a wind that didn't stir grass, that didn't jar windows or
disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Hound
did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it, so you could feel
the silence building up a pressure behind you all across town. Montag
felt the pressure rising, and ran.
He stopped for breath, on his way to the river, to peer through
dimly lit windows of wakened houses, and saw the silhouettes of
people inside watching their parlor walls and there on the walls the
Mechanical Hound, a breath of neon vapor, spidered along, here and
gone, here and gone! Now at Elm Terrace, Lincoln, Oak, Park, and up
the alley toward Faber's house.
Go past, thought Montag, don't stop, go on, don't turn in!

130

On the parlor wall, Faber's house, with its sprinkler system
pulsing in the night air.
The Hound paused, quivering.
No! Montag held to the window sill. This way! Here!
The procaine needle flicked out and in, out and in. A single clear
drop of the stuff of dreams fell from the needle as it vanished in the
Hound's muzzle.
Montag held his breath, like a doubled fist, in his chest.
The Mechanical Hound turned and plunged away from Faber's house
down the alley again.
Montag snapped his gaze to the sky. The helicopters were closer, a
great blowing of insects to a single light source.
With an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no
fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in
actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.
He shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last
house window, and the fascinating séance going on in there! Hell! and
he was away and gone! The alley, a street, the alley, a street, and the
smell of the river. Leg out, leg down, leg out and down. Twenty million
Montags running, soon, if the cameras caught him. Twenty million
Montags running, running like an ancient flickery Keystone Comedy,
cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had seen
it a thousand times. Behind him now twenty million silently baying
Hounds ricocheted across parlors, three-cushion shooting from right
wall to centre wall to left wall, gone, right wall, centre wall, left wall,
gone !
Montag jammed his Seashell to his ear.
"Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as
follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a

131

front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot
escape if everyone in the next minute looks from his house. Ready! "
Of course! Why hadn't they done it before! Why, in all the years,
hadn't this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldn't be
missed! The only man running alone in the night city, the only man
proving his legs!
"At the count of ten now! One! Two!"
He felt the city rise. Three .
He felt the city turn to its thousands of doors.
"Four ! "
The people sleepwalking in their hallways.
"Five! "
He felt their hands on the doorknobs!
The smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain. His throat was
burnt rust and his eyes were wept dry with running. He yelled as if this
yell would jet him on, fling him the last hundred yards.
"Six, seven, eight!"
The doorknobs turned on five thousand doors.
"Nine!"
He ran out away from the last row of houses, on a slope leading
down to a solid moving blackness.
"Ten!"
The doors opened.
He imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards,
into alleys, and into the sky, faces hid by curtains, pale, nightfrightened faces, like grey animals peering from electric caves, faces
with grey colorless eyes, grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out
through the numb flesh of the face.

132

But he was at the river.
He touched it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped
in darkness to the skin, splashed his body, arms, legs, and head with
raw liquor; drank it and snuffed some up his nose. Then he dressed in
Faber's old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river
and watched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out
in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the
dark.
He was three hundred yards downstream when the Hound reached the
river. Overhead the great racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A
storm of light fell upon the river and Montag dived under the great
illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds. He felt the river pull
him further on its way, into darkness. Then the lights switched back to
the land, the helicopters swerved over the city again, as if they had
picked up another trail. They were gone. The Hound was gone. Now
there was only the cold river and Montag floating in a sudden
peacefulness, away from the city and the lights and the chase, away
from everything.
He felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors. He felt as
if he had left the great séance and all the murmuring ghosts. He was
moving from an unreality that was frightening into a reality that was
unreal because it was new.
The black land slid by and he was going into the country among
the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out
above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great
juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush
him.
He floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river
was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate

133

shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper. The
river was very real; it held him comfortably and gave him the time at
last, the leisure, to consider this month, this year, and a lifetime of
years. He listened to his heart slow. His thoughts stopped rushing with
his blood.
He saw the moon low in the sky now. The moon there, and the
light of the moon caused by what? By the sun, of course. And what
lights the sun? Its own fire. And the sun goes on, day after day, burning
and burning. The sun and time. The sun and time and burning.
Burning. The river bobbled him along gently. Burning. The sun and
every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a single thing
in his mind. After a long time of floating on the land and a short time of
floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life.
The sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a
circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and
the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things
with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything
burned!
One of them had to stop burning. The sun wouldn't, certainly. So it
looked as if it had to be Montag and the people he had worked with
until a few short hours ago. Somewhere the saving and putting away
had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one
way or another, in books, in records, in people's heads, any way at all
so long as it was safe, free from moths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and
men with matches. The world was full of burning of all types and sizes.
Now the guild of the asbestos-weaver must open shop very soon.
He felt his heel bump land, touch pebbles and rocks, scrape sand.
The river had moved him toward shore.
He looked in at the great black creature without eyes or

134

light, without shape, with only a size that went a thousand miles
without wanting to stop, with its grass hills and forests that were
waiting for him.
He hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water. He
expected the Hound there. Suddenly the trees might blow under a
great wind of helicopters.
But there was only the normal autumn wind high up, going by
like another river. Why wasn't the Hound running? Why had the
search veered inland? Montag listened. Nothing. Nothing.
Millie, he thought. All this country here. Listen to it! Nothing and
nothing. So much silence, Millie, I wonder how you'd take it? Would
you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad.
Millie was not here and the Hound was not here, but the dry smell of
hay blowing from some distant field put Montag on the land. He
remembered a farm he had visited when he was very young, one of the
rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of
unreality, beyond the walls of parlors and beyond the tin moat of the
city, cows chewed grass and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs
barked after white sheep on a hill.
Now, the dry smell of hay, the motion of the waters, made him
think of sleeping in fresh hay in a lonely barn away from the loud
highways, behind a quiet farmhouse, and under an ancient windmill
that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead. He lay in the
high barn loft all night, listening to distant animals and insects and
trees, the little motions and stirrings.
During the night, he thought, below the loft, he would hear a
sound like feet moving, perhaps. He would tense and sit up. The sound
would move away, He would lie back and look out of the loft window,
very late in the night, and see the lights go out

135

in the farmhouse itself, until a very young and beautiful woman would
sit in an unlit window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to see her,
but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past
now, so very long ago, the girl who had known the weather and never
been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions
meant rubbed off on your chin. Then, she would be gone from the
warm window and appear again upstairs in her moon-whitened room.
And then, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets cutting the sky
into two black pieces beyond the horizon, he would lie in the loft,
hidden and safe, watching those strange new stars over the rim of the
earth, fleeing from the soft color of dawn.
In the morning he would not have needed sleep, for all the warm
odors and sights of a complete country night would have rested and
slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth, when he thought to
test it, was half a smile.
And there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, waiting for him, would be
the incredible thing. He would step carefully down, in the pink light of
early morning, so fully aware of the world that he would be afraid, and
stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it.
A cool glass of fresh milk, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of
the steps.
This was all he wanted now. Some sign that the immense world
would accept him and give him the long time needed to think all the
things that must be thought.
A glass of milk, an apple, a pear.
He stepped from the river.
The land rushed at him, a tidal wave. He was crushed by darkness
and the look of the country and the million odors on a wind that iced
his body. He fell back under the breaking curve

136

of darkness and sound and smell, his ears roaring. He whirled. The
stars poured over his sight like flaming meteors. He wanted to plunge
in the river again and let it idle him safely on down somewhere. This
dark land rising was like that day in his childhood, swimming, when
from nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed
him down in salt mud and green darkness, water burning mouth and
nose, retching his stomach, screaming! Too much water!
Too much land!
Out of the black wall before him, a whisper. A shape. In the shape,
two eyes. The night looking at him. The forest, seeing him.
The Hound!
After all the running and rushing and sweating it out and halfdrowning, to come this far, work this hard, and think yourself safe and
sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find . . .
The Hound!
Montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for
any man.
The shape exploded away. The eyes vanished. The leaf piles flew
up in a dry shower.
Montag was alone in the wilderness.
A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-like perfume mingled with
blood and the gummed exhalation of the animal's breath, all cardamom
and moss and ragweed odor in this huge night where the trees ran at
him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the pulse of the heart behind his
eyes.
There must have been a billion leaves on the land; he waded in
them, a dry river smelling of hot cloves and warm dust. And the other
smells! There was a smell like a cut potato from all the land, raw and
cold and white from having the moon on it most

137

of the night. There was a smell like pickles from a bottle and a smell
like parsley on the table at home. There was a faint yellow odour like
mustard from a jar. There was a smell like carnations from the yard
next door. He put down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child
brushing him. His fingers smelled of liquorice.
He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the
more he was filled up with all the details of the land. He was not
empty. There was more than enough here to fill him. There would
always be more than enough.
He walked in the shallow tide of leaves, stumbling.
And in the middle of the strangeness, a familiarity.
His foot hit something that rang dully.
He moved his hand on the ground, a yard this way, a yard that.
The railroad track.
The track that came out of the city and rusted across the land,
through forests and woods, deserted now, by the river.
Here was the path to wherever he was going. Here was the single
familiar thing, the magic charm he might need a little while, to touch, to
feel beneath his feet, as he moved on into the bramble bushes and the
lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and
the blowing down of leaves.
He walked on the track.
And he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single
fact he could not prove.
Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking
now.
Half an hour later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware
of his entire body, his face, his mouth, his eyes stuffed with blackness,
his ears stuffed with sound, his legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he
saw the fire ahead.

138

The fire was gone, then back again, like a winking eye. He
stopped, afraid he might blow the fire out with a single breath. But the
fire was there and he approached warily, from a long way off. It took
the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it,
and then he stood looking at it from cover. That small motion, the
white and red color, a strange fire because it meant a different thing to
him.
It was not burning; it was warming!
He saw many hands held to its warmth, hands without arms,
hidden in darkness. Above the hands, motionless faces that were only
moved and tossed and flickered with firelight. He hadn't known fire
could look this way. He had never thought in his life that it could give
as well as take. Even its smell was different.
How long he stood he did not know, but there was a foolish and
yet delicious sense of knowing himself as an animal come from the
forest, drawn by the fire. He was a thing of brush and liquid eye, of fur
and muzzle and hoof, he was a thing of horn and blood that would
smell like autumn if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long
long time, listening to the warm crackle of the flames.
There was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was
in the men's faces, and time was there, time enough to sit by this
rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn it over
with the eyes, as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of
steel these men were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was
different. It was the silence. Montag moved toward this special silence
that was concerned with all of the world.
And then the voices began and they were talking, and he could
hear nothing of what the voices said, but the sound rose and fell quietly
and the voices were turning the world over and

139

looking at it; the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which
lay down the track by the river. The voices talked of everything, there
was nothing they could not talk about, he knew from the very cadence
and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them.
And then one of the men looked up and saw him, for the first or
perhaps the seventh time, and a voice called to Montag:
"All right, you can come out now! "
Montag stepped back into the shadows.
"It's all right," the voice said. "You're welcome here."
Montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting
there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits.
He did not know what to say to them.
"Sit down," said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small
group. "Have some coffee?"
He watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin
cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it gingerly and felt
them looking at him with curiosity. His lips were scalded, but that was
good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean,
neat, and their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a
guest, and now they sat down again. Montag sipped.
"Thanks," he said. "Thanks very much."
"You're welcome, Montag. My name's Granger." He held out a
small bottle of colourless fluid. "Drink this, too. It'll change the
chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now you'll
smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the best thing is
Bottoms up."
Montag drank the bitter fluid.
"You'll stink like a bobcat, but that's all right," said Granger.
"You know my name;" said Montag.

140

Granger nodded to a portable battery TV set by the fire.
"We've watched the chase. Figured you'd wind up south along the
river. When we heard you plunging around out in the forest like a
drunken elk, we didn't hide as we usually do. We figured you were in
the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city.
Something funny there. The chase is still running. The other way,
though."
"The other way?"
"Let's have a look."
Granger snapped the portable viewer on. The picture was a
nightmare, condensed, easily passed from hand to hand, in the forest,
all whirring color and flight. A voice cried:
"The chase continues north in the city! Police helicopters are converging
on Avenue 87 and Elm Grove Park!"
Granger nodded. "They're faking. You threw them off at the river.
They can't admit it. They know they can hold their audience only so
long. The show's got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started
searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So they're
sniffing for a scape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. They'll catch
Montag in the next five minutes! "
"But how--"
"Watch."
The camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung
down at an empty street.
"See that?" whispered Granger. "It'll be you; right up at the end of
that street is our victim. See how our camera is coming in? Building the
scene. Suspense. Long shot. Right now, some poor fellow is out for a
walk. A rarity. An odd one. Don't think the police don't know the
habits of queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of
it, or for reasons of insomnia Anyway, the police have had him charted
for months, years. Never know

141

when that sort of information might be handy. And today, it turns out,
it's very usable indeed. It saves face. Oh, God, look there!"
The men at the fire bent forward.
On the screen, a man turned a corner. The Mechanical Hound
rushed forward into the viewer, suddenly. The helicopter light shot
down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the man.
A voice cried, "There's Montag! The search is done!"
The innocent man stood bewildered, a cigarette burning in his
hand. He stared at the Hound, not knowing what it was. He probably
never knew. He glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens. The
cameras rushed down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm
and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out.
It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast
audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victim's
face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target.
"Montag, don't move!" said a voice from the sky.
The camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both
reached him simultaneously. The victim was seized by Hound and
camera in a great spidering, clenching grip. He screamed. He screamed.
He screamed!
Blackout.
Silence.
Darkness.
Montag cried out in the silence and turned away.
Silence.
And then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces
expressionless, an announcer on the dark screen said, "The search is
over, Montag is dead; a crime against society has been avenged."

142

Darkness.
"We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a halfhour of Just-Before-Dawn, a program of-"
Granger turned it off.
"They didn't show the man's face in focus. Did you notice? ven
your best friends couldn't tell if it was you. They scrambled it just
enough to let the imagination take over. Hell," he whispered. "Hell."
Montag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed
to the blank screen, trembling.
Granger touched Montag's arm. "Welcome back from the dead."
Montag nodded. Granger went on. "You might as well know all of us,
now. This is Fred Clement, former occupant of the Thomas Hardy chair
at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Engineering
School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U.C.L.A., a specialist in Ortega
y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for ethics, an ancient study
now, for Columbia University quite some years ago. Reverend Padover
here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one
Sunday and the next for his views. He's been bumming with us some
time now. Myself: I wrote a book called The Fingers in the Glove; the
Proper Relationship between the Individual and Society, and here I am!
Welcome, Montag! "
"I don't belong with you," said Montag, at last, slowly. "I've been
an idiot all the way."
"We're used to that. We all made the right kind of mistakes, or we
wouldn't be here. When we were separate individuals, all we had was
rage. I struck a fireman when he came to burn my library years ago.
I've been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?"
"Yes."

143

"What have you to offer?"
"Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and
maybe a little of Revelation, but I haven't even that now."
"The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. Where was it?"
"Here," Montag touched his head.
"Ah," Granger smiled and nodded.
"What's wrong? Isn't that all right?" said Montag.
"Better than all right; perfect!" Granger turned to the Reverend.
"Do we have a Book of Ecclesiastes?"
"One. A man named Harris of Youngstown."
"Montag." Granger took Montag's shoulder firmly. "Walk
carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you
are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you've become in the
last minute!"
"But I've forgotten!"
"No, nothing's ever lost. We have ways to shake down your
clinkers for you."
"But I've tried to remember!"
"Don't try. It'll come when we need it. All of us have photographic
memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that
are really in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and
now we've got the method down to where we can recall anything that's
been read once. Would you like, some day, Montag, to read Plato's
Republic?"
"Of course!"
"I am Plato's Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons
is Marcus."
"How do you do?" said Mr. Simmons.
"Hello," said Montag.
"I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political
book, Gulliver's Travels! And this other fellow is Charles

144

Darwin, and-this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and this
one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher
indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi
and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Peacock and
Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John."
Everyone laughed quietly.
"It can't be," said Montag.
"It is," replied Granger, smiling. "We're book-burners, too. We read
the books and burnt them, afraid they'd be found. Micro-filming didn't
pay off; we were always travelling, we didn't want to bury the film and
come back later. Always the chance of discovery. Better to keep it in the
old heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and
pieces of history and literature and international law, Byron, Tom
Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, it's here. And the hour is late. And the
war's begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up
in its own coat of a thousand colours. What do you think, Montag?"
"I think I was blind trying to do things my way, planting books in
firemen's houses and sending in alarms."
"You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it
might have worked beautifully. But our way is simpler and, we think,
better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need,
intact and safe. We're not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we
are destroyed, the knowledge is dead, perhaps for good. We are model
citizens, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the
hills at night, and the city people let us be. We're stopped and searched
occasionally, but there's nothing on our persons to incriminate us. The
organization is flexible, very loose, and fragmentary. Some of us have
had plastic surgery on our faces and fingerprints. Right now we have

145

a horrible job; we're waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end.
It's not pleasant, but then we're not in control, we're the odd minority
crying in the wilderness. When the war's over, perhaps we can be of
some use in the world."
"Do you really think they'll listen then?"
"If not, we'll just have to wait. We'll pass the books on to our
children, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the
other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course.
But you can't make people listen. They have to come round in their own
time, wondering what happened and why the world blew up under
them. It can't last."
"How many of you are there?"
"Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, bums
on the outside, libraries inside. It wasn't planned, at first. Each man had
a book he wanted to remember, and did. Then, over a period of twenty
years or so, we met each other, travelling, and got the loose network
together and set out a plan. The most important single thing we had to
pound into ourselves was that we were not important, we mustn't be
pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world. We're
nothing more than dust-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise.
Some of us live in small towns. Chapter One of Thoreau's Walden in
Green River, Chapter Two in Willow Farm, Maine. Why, there's one
town in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bomb'll ever touch
that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell.
Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a
person. And when the war's over, some day, some year, the books can
be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what
they know and we'll set it up in type until another Dark Age, when we
might have to do the whole damn thing over again. But that's the
wonderful thing about man; he

146

never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all
over again, because he knows very well it is important and worth the
doing."
"What do we do tonight?" asked Montag.
"Wait," said Granger. "And move downstream a little way, just in
case."
He began throwing dust and dirt on the fire.
The other men helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the
wilderness, the men all moved their hands, putting out the fire
together.
They stood by the river in the starlight.
Montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. Five. Five o'clock
in the morning. Another year ticked by in a single hour, and dawn
waiting beyond the far bank of the river.
"Why do you trust me?" said Montag.
A man moved in the darkness.
"The look of you's enough. You haven't seen yourself in a mirror
lately. Beyond that, the city has never cared so much about us to bother
with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses
in their heads can't touch them, and they know it and we know it;
everyone knows it. So long as the vast population doesn't wander
about quoting the Magna Charta and the Constitution, it's all right. The
firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities don't
bother us. And you look like hell."
They moved along the bank of the river, going south. Montag tried
to see the men's faces, the old faces he remembered from the firelight,
lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a triumph
over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perhaps he had
expected their faces to burn and glitter

147

with the knowledge they carried, to glow as lanterns glow, with the
light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these
men had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race,
searched a long search, seen good things destroyed, and now, very late,
were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of
the lamps. They weren't at all certain that the things they carried in
their heads might make every future dawn glow with a purer light,
they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their
quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the
customers who might come by in later years, some with clean and some
with dirty fingers.
Montag squinted from one face to another as they walked.
"Don't judge a book by its cover," someone said.
And they all laughed quietly, moving downstream.
There was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long
before the men looked up. Montag stared back at the city, far down the
river, only a faint glow now.
"My wife's back there."
"I'm sorry to hear that. The cities won't do well in the next few
days," said Granger.
"It's strange, I don't miss her, it's strange I don't feel much of
anything," said Montag. "Even if she dies, I realized a moment ago, I
don't think I'll feel sad. It isn't right. Something must be wrong with
me."
"Listen," said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him,
holding aside the bushes to let him pass. "When I was a boy my
grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind man
who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the
slum in our town; and he made toys for us

148

and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his
hands. And when he died, I suddenly realized I wasn't crying for him
at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them
again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise
doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did,
or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all
the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way
he did. He was individual. He was an important man. I've never gotten
over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to
birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world,
and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands. He shaped
the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten
million fine actions the night he passed on."
Montag walked in silence. "Millie, Millie," he whispered. "Millie."
"What?"
"My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I can't remember
anything. I think of her hands but I don't see them doing anything at
all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or
there's a cigarette in them, but that's all."
Montag turned and glanced back.
What did you give to the city, Montag?
Ashes.
What did the others give to each other?
Nothingness.
Granger stood looking back with Montag. "Everyone must leave
something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a
book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or
a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your
soul has somewhere to go when you

149

die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted,
you're there. It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you
change something from the way it was before you touched it into
something that's like you after you take your hands away. The
difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is
in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have
been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime."
Granger moved his hand. "My grandfather showed me some V-2
rocket films once, fifty years ago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb
mushroom from two hundred miles up? It's a pinprick, it's nothing.
With the wilderness all around it.
"My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then
hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and
the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people that we're
allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness
that can take back what it has given, as easily as blowing its breath on
us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so big. When we forget how
close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will
come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it
can be. You see?" Granger turned to Montag. "Grandfather's been dead
for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by God, in the
convolutions of my brain you'd find the big ridges of his thumbprint.
He touched me. As I said earlier, he was a sculptor. 'I hate a Roman
named Status Quo!' he said to me. 'Stuff your eyes with wonder,' he
said, 'live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more
fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no
guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if
there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside
down in a tree all day every day,

150

sleeping its life away. To hell with that,' he said, 'shake the tree and
knock the great sloth down on his ass.'"
"Look!" cried Montag.
And the war began and ended in that instant.
Later, the men around Montag could not say if they had really
seen anything. Perhaps the merest flourish of light and motion in the
sky. Perhaps the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles,
one mile up, for the merest instant, like grain thrown over the heavens
by a great sowing hand, and the bombs drifting with dreadful
swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning city they had
left behind. The bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished,
once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five
thousand miles an hour; as quick as the whisper of a scythe the war
was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a
full three seconds, all of the time in history, before the bombs struck,
the enemy ships themselves were gone half around the visible world,
like bullets in which a savage islander might not believe because they
were invisible; yet the heart is suddenly shattered, the body falls in
separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air; the
brain squanders its few precious memories and, puzzled, dies.
This was not to be believed. It was merely a gesture. Montag saw
the flirt of a great metal fist over the far city and he knew the scream of
the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, disintegrate, leave
no stone on another, perish. Die.
Montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his
mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. "Run!" he cried to
Faber. To Clarisse, "Run!" To Mildred, "Get out, get out of there!" But
Clarisse, he remembered, was dead. And Faber was out; there in the
deep valleys of the country

151

somewhere the five a.m. bus was on its way from one desolation to
another. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air,
it was certain as man could make it. Before the bus had run another
fifty yards on the highway, its destination would be meaningless, and
its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard.
And Mildred . . .
Get out, run!
He saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond
remaining with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her building. He
saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of colour and
motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her, where the
family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and
said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a half-inch, now a
quarter-inch from the top of the hotel. Leaning into the wall as if all of
the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease
there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, nervously, as if to plunge, drop, fall
into that swarming immensity of color to drown in its bright happiness.
The first bomb struck.
"Mildred!"
Perhaps, who would ever know? Perhaps the great broadcasting
stations with their beams of color and light and talk and chatter went
first into oblivion.
Montag, falling flat, going down, saw or felt, or imagined he saw
or felt the walls go dark in Millie's face, heard her screaming, because
in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own face reflected there,
in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty
face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of
itself, that at last she recognized it as her own and looked quickly up at
the ceiling as it and the

152

entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a
million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people
in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the
explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way.
I remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago.
Chicago, a long time ago. Millie and I. That's where we met! I
remember now. Chicago. A long time ago.
The concussion knocked the air across and down the river, turned
the men over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in lifting sprays,
and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn with a great
wind passing away south. Montag crushed himself down, squeezing
himself small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant saw the
city, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For
another of those impossible instants the city stood, rebuilt and
unrecognizable, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller
than man had built it, erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and
sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a reversed avalanche, a
million colours, a million oddities, a door where a window should be, a
top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell
down dead.
The sound of its death came after.
Montag, lying there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine wet cement of
dust in his now shut mouth, gasping and crying, now thought again, I
remember, I remember, I remember something else. What is it? Yes,
yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it,
quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off,
before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to
himself

153

silently, lying flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many
times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denham's
Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Preacher by himself, standing there
in his mind, looking at him....
"There," said a voice.
The men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass. They held to
the earth as children hold to familiar things, no matter how cold or
dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were
clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums
from bursting, to keep their sanity from bursting, mouths open,
Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that ripped
their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed.
Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move
down upon their world. And lying there it seemed that he saw every
single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every
cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now. Silence fell
down in the sifting dust, and all the leisure they might need to look
around, to gather the reality of this day into their senses.
Montag looked at the river. We'll go on the river. He looked at the
old railroad tracks. Or we'll go that way. Or we'll walk on the highways
now, and we'll have time to put things into ourselves. And some day,
after it sets in us a long time, it'll come out of our hands and our
mouths. And a lot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right.
We'll just start walking today and see the world and the way the world
walks around and talks, the way it really looks. I want to see
everything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a
while it'll all gather together inside and it'll be me. Look at the world
out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there
beyond my face

154

and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it's finally me,
where it's in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten
thousand a day. I get hold of it so it'll never run off. I'll hold on to the
world tight some day. I've got one finger on it now; that's a beginning.
The wind died.
The other men lay a while, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet
ready to rise up and begin the day's obligations, its fires and foods, its
thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They
lay blinking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast,
then slower, then slow ....
Montag sat up.
He did not move any further, however. The other men did
likewise. The sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip.
The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain.
Silently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing
incessantly under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled
down to the river to look upstream.
"It's flat," he said, a long time later. "City looks like a heap of
baking-powder. It's gone." And a long time after that. "I wonder how
many knew it was coming? I wonder how many were surprised?"
And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities
dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a thousand?
Someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper
taken from their pocket, and shoved this under a bit of grass and
leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet and
sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early
morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking
up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly,

155

with nothing to say, and the sun colored the backs of their necks as
they bent down.
Granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. "We'll have a
bite. Then we'll turn around and walk upstream. They'll be needing us
up that way."
Someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it
and the frying-pan was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began
to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning
air with its aroma. The men watched this ritual silently.
Granger looked into the fire. "Phoenix."
"What?"
"There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ:
every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He
must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up
he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it
looks like we're doing the same thing, over and over, but we've got one
damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we
just did. We know all the damn silly things we've done for a thousand
years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where
we can see it, some day we'll stop making the goddam funeral pyres
and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people
that remember, every generation."
He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it,
slowly, thoughtfully.
"Now, let's get on upstream," said Granger. "And hold on to one
thought: You're not important. You're not anything. Some day the load
we're carrying with us may help someone. But even when we had the
books on hand, a long time ago, we didn't use what we got out of them.
We went right on insulting the dead.

156

We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died
before us. We're going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week
and the next month and the next year. And when they ask us what
we're doing, you can say, We're remembering. That's where we'll win
out in the long run. And some day we'll remember so much that we'll
build the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and dig the biggest
grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up. Come on now, we're
going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors
for the next year and take a long look in them."
They finished eating and put out the fire. The day was brightening
all about them as if a pink lamp had been given more wick. In the trees,
the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down.
Montag began walking and after a moment found that the others
had fallen in behind him, going north. He was surprised, and moved
aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him
on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the
rusting track going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns
stood full of hay, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on
their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and certainly
not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep
right on going until he caught up with the people.
But now there was a long morning's walk until noon, and if the
men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and
much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up
and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things
they remembered, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain
that things were safe in them. Montag felt the slow stir of words, the
slow simmer. And

157

when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a
day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a
season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time
to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What
else? Something, something . . .
And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve
manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree
were for the healing of the nations.
Yes, thought Montag, that's the one I'll save for noon. For noon...
When we reach the city.

ONE
A merry little surge of electricity piped by automatic alarm from the mood organ beside his bed
awakened Rick Deckard. Surprised - it always surprised him to find himself awake without prior
notice - he rose from the bed, stood up in his multicolored pajamas, and stretched. Now, in her bed,
his wife Iran opened her gray, unmerry eyes, blinked, then groaned and shut her eyes again.
"You set your Penfield too weak he said to her. "I'll reset it and you'll be awake and - "
"Keep your hand off my settings." Her voice held bitter sharpness. "I don't want to be awake."
He seated himself beside her, bent over her, and explained softly. "If you set the surge up high
enough, you'll be glad you're awake; that's the whole point. At setting C it overcomes the threshold
barring consciousness, as it does for me." Friendlily, because he felt well-disposed toward the world
his setting had been at D - he patted her bare, pate shoulder.
"Get your crude cop's hand away," Iran said.
"I'm not a cop - " He felt irritable, now, although he hadn't dialed for it.
"You're worse," his wife said, her eyes still shut. "You're a murderer hired by the cops.
"I've never killed a human being in my life." His irritability had risen, now; had become outright
hostility.
Iran said, "Just those poor andys."
"I notice you've never had any hesitation as to spending the bounty money I bring home on
whatever momentarily attracts your attention." He rose, strode to the console of his mood organ.
"Instead of saving," he said, "so we could buy a real sheep, to replace that fake electric one upstairs.
A mere electric animal, and me earning all that I've worked my way up to through the years." At his
console he hesitated between dialing for a thalamic suppressant (which would abolish his mood of
rage) or a thalamic stimulant (which would make him irked enough to win the argument).
"If you dial," Iran said, eyes open and watching, "for greater venom, then I'll dial the same. I'll dial
the maximum and you'll see a fight that makes every argument we've had up to now seem like
nothing. Dial and see; just try me." She rose swiftly, loped to the console of her own mood organ,
stood glaring at him, waiting.
He sighed, defeated by her threat. "I'll dial what's on my schedule for today." Examining the
schedule for January 3, 1992, he saw that a businesslike professional attitude was called for. "If I dial
by schedule," he said warily, "will you agree to also?" He waited, canny enough not to commit
himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit.
"My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression," Iran said.
"What? Why did you schedule that?" It defeated the whole purpose of the mood organ. "I didn't
even know you could set it for that," he said gloomily.
"I was sitting here one afternoon," Iran said, "and naturally I had tamed on Buster Friendly and His
Friendly Friends and he was talking about a big news item he's about to break and then that awful
commercial came on, the one I hate; you know, for Mountibank Lead Codpieces. And so for a
minute I shut off the sound. And I heard the building, this building; I heard the - " She gestured.
"Empty apartments," Rick said. Sometimes he heard them at night when he was supposed to be
asleep. And yet, for this day and age a one-half occupied conapt building rated high in the scheme of
population density; out in what had been before the war the suburbs one could find buildings entirely
empty . . . or so he had heard. He had let the information remain secondhand; like most people he
did not care to experience it directly.
"At that moment," Iran said, "when I had the TV sound off, I was in a 382 mood; I had just dialed
it. So although I heard the emptiness intellectually, I didn't feel it. My first reaction consisted of being

4

grateful that we could afford a Penfield mood organ. But then I read how unhealthy it was, sensing
the absence of life, not just in this building but everywhere, and not reacting - do you see? I guess
you don't. But that used to be considered a sign of mental illness; they called it 'absence of
appropriate affect.' So I left the TV sound off and I sat down at my mood organ and I experimented.
And I finally found a setting for despair." Her dark, pert face showed satisfaction, as if she had
achieved something of worth. "So I put it on my schedule for twice a month; I think that's a
reasonable amount of time to feel hopeless about everything, about staying here on Earth after
everybody who's small has emigrated, don't you think?"
"But a mood like that," Rick said, "you're apt to stay in it, not dial your way out. Despair like that,
about total reality, is self-perpetuating."
"I program an automatic resetting for three hours later," his wife said sleekly. "A 481. Awareness
of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future; new hope that - "
"I know 481," he interrupted. He had dialed out the combination many times; he relied on it
greatly. "Listen," he said, seating himself on his bed and taking hold of her hands to draw her down
beside him, "even with an automatic cutoff it's dangerous to undergo a depression, any kind. Forget
what you've scheduled and I'll forget what I've scheduled; we'll dial a 104 together and both
experience it, and then you stay in it while I reset mine for my usual businesslike attitude. That way I'll
want to hop up to the roof and check out the sheep and then head for the office; meanwhile I'll know
you're not sitting here brooding with no TV." He released her slim, long fingers, passed through the
spacious apartment to the living room, which smelled faintly of last night's cigarettes. There he bent to
turn on the TV.
From the bedroom Iran's voice came. "I can't stand TV before breakfast."
"Dial 888," Rick said as the set warmed. "The desire to watch TV, no matter what's on it."
"I don't feel like dialing anything at all now," Iran said.
"Then dial 3," he said.
"I can't dial a setting that stimulates my cerebral cortex into wanting to dial! If I don't want to dial,
I don't want to dial that most of all, because then I will want to dial, and wanting to dial is right now
the most alien drive I can imagine; I just want to sit here on the bed and stare at the floor." Her voice
had become sharp with overtones of bleakness as her soul congealed and she ceased to move, as
the instinctive, omnipresent film of great weight, of an almost absolute inertia, settled over her.
He turned up the TV sound, and the voice of Buster Friendly boomed out and filled the room. " ho ho, folks. Time now for a brief note on today's weather. The Mongoose satellite reports that
fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and will then taper off, so all you folks who'll be
venturing out - "
Appearing beside him, her long nightgown trailing wispily, Iran shut off the TV set. "Okay, I give
up; I'll dial. Anything you want me to be; ecstatic sexual bliss - I feel so bad I'll even endure that.
What the hell. What difference does it make?"
"I'll dial for both of us, Rick said, and led her back into the bedroom. There, at her console, he
dialed 594: pleased acknowledgment of husband's superior wisdom in all matters. On his own
console he dialed for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job, although this he hardly needed;
such was his habitual, innate approach without recourse to Penfield artificial brain stimulation.
After a hurried breakfast - he had lost time due to the discussion with his wife - he ascended clad
for venturing out, including his Ajax model Mountibank Lead Codpiece, to the covered roof pasture
whereon his electric sheep "grazed." Whereon it, sophisticated piece of hardware that it was,
chomped away in simulated contentment, bamboozling the other tenants of the building.

5

Of course, some of their animals undoubtedly consisted of electronic circuitry fakes, too; he had
of course never nosed into the matter, any more than they, his neighbors, had pried into the real
workings of his sheep. Nothing could be more impolite. To say, "Is your sheep genuine?" would be a
worse breach of manners than to inquire whether a citizen's teeth, hair, or internal organs would test
out authentic.
The morning air, spilling over with radioactive motes, gray and sun - beclouding, belched about
him, haunting his nose; fie sniffed involuntarily the taint of death. Well, that was too strong a
description for it, he decided as he made his way to the particular plot of sod which he owned along
with the unduly large apartment below. The legacy of World War Terminus had diminished in
potency; those who could not survive the dust had passed into oblivion years ago, and the dust,
weaker now and confronting the strong survivors, only deranged minds and genetic properties.
Despite his lead codpiece the dust - undoubtedly - filtered in and at him, brought him daily, so long
as he failed to emigrate, its little load of befouling filth. So far, medical checkups taken monthly
confirmed him as a regular: a man who could reproduce within the tolerances set by law. Any month,
however, the exam by the San Francisco Police Department doctors could reveal otherwise.
Continually, new specials came into existence, created out of regulars by the omnipresent dust. The
saying currently blabbed by posters, TV ads, and government junk mail, ran: "Emigrate or
degenerate! The choice is yours! " Very true, Rick thought as he opened the gate to his little pasture
and approached his electric sheep. But I can't emigrate, he said to himself. Because of my job.
The owner of the adjoining pasture, his conapt neighbor Bill Barbour, hailed him; he, like Rick,
had dressed for work but had stopped off on the way to check his animal, too.
"My horse," Barbour declared beamingly, "is pregnant." He indicated the big Percheron, which
stood staring off in an empty fashion into space. "What do you say to that?"
"I say pretty soon you'll have two horses," Rick said. He had reached his sheep, now; it lay
ruminating, its alert eyes fixed on him in case he had brought any rolled oats with him. The alleged
sheep contained an oat-tropic circuit; at the sight of such cereals it would scramble up convincingly
and amble over. "What's she pregnant by?" he asked Barbour. "The wind?"
"I bought some of the highest quality fertilizing plasma available in California," Barbour informed
him. "Through inside contacts I have with the State Animal Husbandry Board. Don't you remember
last week when their inspector was out here examining Judy? They're eager to have her foal; she's an
unmatched superior." Barbour thumped his horse fondly on the neck and she inclined her head
toward him.
"Ever thought of selling your horse?" Rick asked. He wished to god he had a horse, in fact any
animal. Owning and maintaining a fraud had a way of gradually demoralizing one. And yet from a
social standpoint it had to be done, given the absence of the real article. He had therefore no choice
except to continue. Even were he not to care himself, there remained his wife, and Iran did care.
Very much.
Barbour said, "It would be immoral to sell my horse."
"Sell the colt, then. Having two animals is more immoral than not having any."
Puzzled, Barbour said, "How do you mean? A lot of people have two animals, even three, four,
and like in the case of Fred Washborne, who owns the algae-processing plant my brother works at,
even five. Didn't you see that article about his duck in yesterday's Chronicle? It's supposed to be the
heaviest, largest Moscovy on the West Coast." The man's eyes glazed over, imagining such
possessions; he drifted by degrees into a trance.
Exploring about in his coat pockets, Rick found his creased, much-studied copy of Sidney's
Animal & Fowl Catalogue January supplement. He looked in the index, found colts (vide horses,

6

offsp.) and presently had the prevailing national price. "I can buy a Percheron colt from Sidney's for
five thousand dollars," he said aloud.
"No you can't," Barbour said. "Look at the listing again; it's in italics. That means they don't have
any in stock, but that would be the price if they did have."
"Suppose," Rick said, "I pay you five hundred dollars a month for ten months. Full catalogue
value."
Pityingly, Barbour said, "Deckard, you don't understand about horses; there's a reason why
Sidney's doesn't have any Percheron colts in stock. Percheron colts just don't change hands - at
catalogue value, even. They're too scarce, even relatively inferior ones." He leaned across their
common fence, gesticulating. "I've had Judy for three years and not in all that time have I seen a
Percheron mare of her quality. To acquire her I had to fly to Canada, and I personally drove her
back here myself to make sure she wasn't stolen. You bring an animal like this anywhere around
Colorado or Wyoming and they'll knock you off to get hold of it. You know why? Because back
before W.W.T. there existed literally hundreds - "
"But," Rick interrupted, "for you to have two horses and me none, that violates the whole basic
theological and moral structure of Mercerism."
"You have your sheep; hell, you can follow the Ascent in your individual life, and when you grasp
the two handles of empathy you approach honorably. Now if you didn't have that old sheep, there,
I'd see some logic in your position. Sure, if I had two animals and you didn't have any, I'd be helping
deprive you of true fusion with Mercer. But every family in this building - let's see; around fifty: one
to every three apts, as I compute it - every one of us has an animal of some sort. Graveson has that
chicken over there." He gestured north. "Oakes and his wife have that big red dog that barks in the
night." He pondered. "I think Ed Smith has a cat down in his apt; - at least he says so, but no one's
ever seen it. Possibly he's just pretending."
Going over to his sheep, Rick bent down, searching in the thick white wool - the fleece at least
was genuine - until he found what he was looking for: the concealed control panel of the mechanism.
As Barbour watched he snapped open the panel covering, revealing it. "See?" he said to Barbour.
"You understand now why I want your colt so badly?"
After an interval Barbour said, "You poor guy. Has it always been this way?"
"No," Rick said, once again closing the panel covering of his electric sheep; he straightened up,
turned, and faced his neighbor. "I had a real sheep, originally. My wife's father gave it to us outright
when he emigrated. Then, about a year ago, remember that time I took it to the vet - you were up
here that morning when I came out and found it lying on its side and it couldn't get up."
"You got it to its feet," Barbour said, remembering and nodding. "Yeah, you managed to lift it up
but then after a minute or two of walking around it fell over again."
Rick said, "Sheep get strange diseases. Or put another way, sheep get a lot of diseases but the
symptoms are always the same; the sheep can't get up and there's no way to tell how serious it is,
whether it's a sprained leg or the animal's dying of tetanus. That's what mine died of; tetanus."
"Up here?" Barbour said. "On the roof?"
"The hay," Rick explained. "That one time I didn't get all the wire off the bale; I left a piece and
Groucho - that's what I called him, then - got a scratch and in that way contracted tetanus. I took
him to the vet's and he died, and I thought about it, and finally I called one of those shops that
manufacture artificial animals and I showed them a photograph of Groucho. They made this." He
indicated the reclining ersatz animal, which continued to ruminate attentively, still watching alertly for
any indication of oats. "It's a premium job. And I've put as much time and attention into caring for it
as I did when it was real. But - " He shrugged.

7

"It's not the same," Barbour finished.
"But almost. You feel the same doing it; you have to keep your eye on it exactly as you did when
it was really alive. Because they break down and then everyone in the building knows. I've had it at
the repair shop six times, mostly little malfunctions, but if anyone saw them - for instance one time the
voice tape broke or anyhow got fouled and it wouldn't stop baaing - they'd recognize it as a
mechanical breakdown." He added, "The repair outfit's truck is of course marked 'animal hospital
something.' And the driver dresses like a vet, completely in white." He glanced suddenly at his watch,
remembering the time. "I have to get to work," he said to Barbour. "I'll see you this evening."
As he started toward his car Barbour called after him hurriedly, "Um, I won't say anything to
anybody here in the building."
Pausing, Rick started to say thanks. But then something of the despair that Iran had been talking
about tapped him on the shoulder and he said, "I don't know; maybe it doesn't make any difference."
"But they'll look down on you. Not all of them, but some. You know how people are about not
taking care of an animal; they consider it immoral and anti-empathic. I mean, technically it's not a
crime like it was right after W.W.T. but the feeling's still there."
"God," Rick said futilely, and gestured empty-handed. "I want to have an animal; I keep trying to
buy one. But on my salary, on what a city employee makes - " If, he thought, I could get lucky in my
work again. As I did two years ago when I managed to bag four andys during one month. If I had
known then, he thought, that Groucho was going to die . . . but that had been before the tetanus.
Before the two-inch piece of broken, hypodermic-like baling wire.
"You could buy a cat," Barbour offered. "Cats are cheap; look in your Sidney's catalogue."
Rick said quietly, "I don't want a domestic pet. I want what I originally had, a large animal. A
sheep or if I can get the money a cow or a steer or what you have; a horse." The bounty from retiring
five andys would do it, he realized. A thousand dollars apiece, over and above my salary. Then
somewhere I could find, from someone, what I want. Even if the listing in Sidney's Animal & Fowl is
in italics. Five thousand dollars - but, he thought, the five andys first have to make their way to Earth
from one of the colony planets; I can't control that, I can't make five of them come here, and even if I
could there are other bounty hunters with other police agencies throughout the world. The andys
would specifically have to take up residence in Northern California, and the senior bounty hunter in
this area, Dave Holden, would have to die or retire.
"Buy a cricket," Barbour suggested wittily. "Or a mouse. Hey, for twenty-five bucks you can buy
a full-grown mouse."
Rick said, "Your horse could die, like Groucho died, without warning. When you get home from
work this evening you could find her laid out on her back, her feet in the air, like a bug. Like what
you said, a cricket." He strode off, car key in his hand.
"Sorry if I offended you," Barbour said nervously.
In silence Rick Deckard plucked open the door of his hovercar. He had nothing further to say to
his neighbor; his mind was on his work, on the day ahead.

TWO
In a giant, empty, decaying building which had once housed thousands, a single TV set hawked its
wares to an uninhabited room.
This ownerless ruin had, before World War Terminus, been tended and maintained. Here had
been the suburbs of San Francisco, a short ride by monorail rapid transit; the entire peninsula had
chattered like a bird tree with life and opinions and complaints, and now the watchful owners had
either died or migrated to a colony world. Mostly the former; it had been a costly war despite the
valiant predictions of the Pentagon and its smug scientific vassel, the Rand Corporation - which had,
in fact, existed not far from this spot. Like the apartment owners, the corporation had departed,
evidently for good. No one missed it.
In addition, no one today remembered why the war had come about or who, if anyone, had won.
The dust which had contaminated most of the planet's surface had originated in no country and no
one, even the wartime enemy, had planned on it. First, strangely, the owls had died. At the time it
had seemed almost funny, the fat, fluffy white birds lying here and there, in yards and on streets;
coming out no earlier than twilight as they had while alive the owls escaped notice. Medieval plagues
had manifested themselves in a similar way, in the form of many dead rats. This plague, however, had
descended from above.
After the owls, of course, the other birds followed, but by then the mystery had been grasped and
understood. A meager colonization program had been underway before the war but now that the sun
had ceased to shine on Earth the colonization entered an entirely new phase. In connection with this a
weapon of war, the Synthetic Freedom Fighter, had been modified; able to function on an alien
world the humanoid robot - strictly speaking, the organic android - had become the mobile donkey
engine of the colonization program. Under U.N. law each emigrant automatically received possession
of an android subtype of his choice, and, by 1990, the variety of subtypes passed all understanding,
in the manner of American automobiles of the ig6os.
That had been the ultimate incentive of emigration: the android servant as carrot, the radioactive
fallout as stick. The U.N. had made it easy to emigrate, difficult if not impossible to stay. Loitering on
Earth potentially meant finding oneself abruptly classed as biologically unacceptable, a menace to the
pristine heredity of the race. Once pegged as special, a citizen, even if accepting sterilization,
dropped out of history. He ceased, in effect, to be part of mankind. And yet persons here and there
declined to migrate; that, even to those involved, constituted a perplexing irrationality. Logically,
every regular should have emigrated already. Perhaps, deformed as it was, Earth remained familiar,
to be clung to. Or possibly the non-emigrant imagined that the tent of dust would deplete itself finally.
In any case thousands of individuals remained, most of them constellated in urban areas where they
could physically see one another, take heart at their mutual presence. Those appeared to be the
relatively sane ones. And, in dubious addition to them, occasional peculiar entities remained in the
virtually abandoned suburbs.
John Isidore, being yammered at by the television set in his living room as he shaved in the
bathroom, was one of these.
He simply had wandered to this spot in the early days following the war. In those evil times no one
had known, really, what they were doing. Populations, detached by the war, had roamed, squatted
temporarily at first one region and then another. Back then the fallout had been sporadic and highly
variable; some states had been nearly free of it, others became saturated. The displaced populations
moved as the dust moved. The peninsula south of San Francisco had been at first dust-free, and a

9

great body of persons had responded by taking up residence there; when the dust arrived, some had
died and the rest had departed. J. R. Isidore remained.
The TV set shouted, " - duplicates the halcyon days of the pre-Civil War Southern states! Either
as body servants or tireless field hands, the custom-tailored humanoid robot designed specifically for
YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS, FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE - given to you on your arrival
absolutely free, equipped fully, as specified by you before your departure from Earth; this loyal,
trouble-free companion in the greatest, boldest adventure contrived by man in modern history will
provide - " It continued on and on.
I wonder if I'm late for work, Isidore wondered as he scraped. He did not own a working clock;
generally he depended on the TV for time signals, but today was Interspace Horizons Day, evidently.
Anyhow the TV claimed this to be the fifth (or sixth?) anniversary of the founding of New America,
the chief U.S. settlement on Mars. And his TV set, being partly broken, picked up only the channel
which had been nationalized during the war and still remained so; the government in Washington,
with its colonization program, constituted the sole sponsor which Isidore found himself forced to
listen to.
"Let's hear from Mrs. Maggie Klugman," the TV announcer suggested to John Isidore, who
wanted only to know the time. "A recent immigrant to Mars, Mrs. Klugman in an interview taped live
in New New York had this to say. Mrs. Klugman, how would you contrast your life back on
contaminated Earth with your new life here in a world rich with every imaginable possibility?" A
pause, and then a tired, dry, middle-aged, female voice said, "I think what I and my family of three
noticed most was the dignity." "The dignity, Mrs. Klugman? " the announcer asked. "Yes," Mrs.
Klugman, now of New New York, Mars, said. "It's a hard thing to explain. Having a servant you
can depend on in these troubled times . . . I find it reassuring."
"Back on Earth, Mrs. Klugman, in the old days, did you also worry about finding yourself
classified, ahem, as a special?"
"Oh, my husband and myself worried ourselves nearly to death. Of course, once we emigrated
that worry vanished, fortunately forever."
To himself John Isidore thought acidly, And it's gone away for me, too, without my having to
emigrate. He had been a special now for over a year, and not merely in regard to the distorted genes
which he carried. Worse still, he had failed to pass the minimum mental faculties test, which made
him in popular parlance a chickenhead. Upon him the contempt of three planets descended.
However, despite this, he survived. He had his job, driving a pickup and delivery truck for a falseanimal repair firm; the Van Ness Pet Hospital and his gloomy, gothic boss Hannibal Sloat accepted
him as human and this he appreciated. Mors certa, vita incerta, as Mr. Sloat occasionally declared.
Isidore, although he had heard the expression a number of times, retained only a dim notion as to its
meaning. After all, if a chickenhead could fathom Latin he would cease to be a chickenhead. Mr.
Sloat, when this was pointed out to him, acknowledged its truth. And there existed chickenheads
infinitely stupider than Isidore, who could hold no jobs at all, who remained in custodial institutions
quaintly called "Institute of Special Trade Skills of America," the word "special" having to get in there
somehow, as always.
" - your husband felt no protection," the TV announcer was saying, "in owning and continually
wearing an expensive and clumsy radiation-proof lead codpiece, Mrs. Klugman?"
"My husband," Mrs. Klugman began, but at that point, having finished shaving, Isidore strode into
the living room and shut off the TV set.
Silence. It flashed from the woodwork and the walls; it smote him with an awful, total power, as if
generated by a vast mill. It rose from the floor, up out of the tattered gray wall-to-wall carpeting. It

10

unleashed itself from the broken and semi-broken appliances in the kitchen, the dead machines which
hadn't worked in all the time Isidore had lived here. From the useless pole lamp in the living room it
oozed out, meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself from the fly-specked ceiling. It
managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision, as if it - the silence meant to
supplant all things tangible. Hence it assailed not only his ears but his eyes; as he stood by the inert
TV set he experienced the silence as visible and, in its own way, alive. Alive! He had often felt its
austere approach before; when it came it burst in without subtlety, evidently unable to wait. The
silence of the world could not rein back its greed. Not any longer. Not when it had virtually won.
He wondered, then, if the others who had remained on Earth experienced the void this way. Or
was it peculiar to his peculiar biological identity, a freak generated by his inept sensory apparatus?
Interesting question, Isidore thought. But whom could he compare notes with? He lived alone in this
deteriorating, blind building of a thousand uninhabited apartments, which like all its counterparts, fell,
day by day, into greater entropic ruin. Eventually everything within the building would merge, would
be faceless and identical, mere pudding-like kipple piled to the ceiling of each apartment. And, after
that, the uncared-for building itself would settle into shapelessness, buried under the ubiquity of the
dust. By then, naturally, he himself would be dead, another interesting event to anticipate as he stood
here in his stricken living room atone with the lungless, all-penetrating, masterful world-silence.
Better, perhaps, to turn the TV back on. But the ads, directed at the remaining regulars, frightened
him. They informed him in a countless procession of ways that he, a special, wasn't wanted. Had no
use. Could not, even if he wanted to, emigrate. So why listen to that? He asked himself irritably.
Fork them and their colonization, I hope a war gets started there - after all, it theoretically could and they wind up like Earth. And everybody who emigrated turns out to be special.
Okay, he thought; I'm off to work. He reached for the doorknob that opened the way out into the
unlit hall, then shrank back as he glimpsed the vacuity of the rest of the building. It lay in wait for him,
out here, the force which he had felt busily penetrating his specific apartment. God, he thought, and
reshut the door. He was not ready for the trip up those clanging stairs to the empty roof where he
had no animal. The echo of himself ascending: the echo of nothing. Time to grasp the handles, he said
to himself, and crossed the living room to the black empathy box.
When he turned it on the usual faint smell of negative ions surged from the power supply; he
breathed in eagerly, already buoyed up. Then the cathode-ray tube glowed like an imitation, feeble
TV image; a collage formed, made of apparently random colors, trails, and configurations which,
until the handles were grasped, amounted to nothing. So, taking a deep breath to steady himself, he
grasped the twin handles.
The visual image congealed; he saw at once a famous landscape, the old, brown, barren ascent,
with tufts of dried-out bonelike weeds poking slantedly into a dim and sunless sky. One single figure,
more or less human in form, toiled its way up the hillside: an elderly man wearing a dull, featureless
robe, covering as meager as if it had been snatched from the hostile emptiness of the sky. The man,
Wilbur Mercer, plodded ahead, and, as he clutched the handles, John Isidore gradually experienced
a waning of the living room in which he stood; the dilapidated furniture and walls ebbed out and he
ceased to experience them at all. He found himself, instead, as always before, entering into the
landscape of drab hill, drab sky. And at the same time he no longer witnessed the climb of the elderly
man. His own feet now scraped, sought purchase, among the familiar loose stones; he felt the same
old painful, irregular roughness beneath his feet and once again smelled the acrid haze of the sky not Earth's sky but that of some place alien, distant, and yet, by means of the empathy box, instantly
available.

11

He had crossed over in the usual perplexing fashion; physical merging - accompanied by mental
and spiritual identification - with Wilbur Mercer had reoccurred. As it did for everyone who at this
moment clutched the handles, either here on Earth or on one of the colony planets. He experienced
them, the others, incorporated the babble of their thoughts, heard in his own brain the noise of their
many individual existences. They - and he - cared about one thing; this fusion of their mentalities
oriented their attention on the hill, the climb, the need to ascend. Step by step it evolved, so slowly as
to be nearly imperceptible. But it was there. Higher, he thought as stones rattled downward under his
feet. Today we are higher than yesterday, and tomorrow - he, the compound figure of Wilbur
Mercer, glanced up to view the ascent ahead. Impossible to make out the end. Too far. But it would
come.
A rock, hurled at him, struck his arm. He felt the pain. He half turned and another rock sailed past
him, missing him; it collided with the earth and the sound startled him. Who? he wondered, peering to
see his tormentor. The old antagonists, manifesting themselves at the periphery of his vision; it, or
they, had followed him all the way up the hill and they would remain until at the top He remembered the top, the sudden leveling of the hill, when the climb ceased and the other part
of it began. How many times had he done this? The several times blurred; future and past blurred;
what he had already experienced and what he would eventually experience blended so that nothing
remained but the moment, the standing still and resting during which he rubbed the cut on his arm
which the stone had left. God, he thought in weariness. In what way is this fair? Why am I up here
alone like this, being tormented by something I can't even see? And then, within him, the mutual
babble of everyone else in fusion broke the illusion of aloneness.
You felt it, too, he thought. Yes, the voices answered. We got hit, on the left arm; it hurts like hell.
Okay, he said. We better get started moving again. He resumed walking, and all of them
accompanied him immediately.
Once, he remembered, it had been different. Back before the curse had come, an earlier, happier
part of life. They, his foster parents Frank and Cora Mercer, had found him floating on an inflated
rubber air-rescue raft, off the coast of New England . . . or had it been Mexico, near the port of
Tampico? He did not now remember the circumstances. Childhood had been nice; he had loved all
life, especially the animals, had in fact been able for a time to bring dead animals back as they had
been. He lived with rabbits and bugs, wherever it was, either on Earth or a colony world; now he
had forgotten that, too. But he recalled the killers, because they had arrested him as a freak, more
special than any of the other specials. And due to that everything had changed.
Local law prohibited the time-reversal faculty by which the dead returned to life; they had spelled
it out to him during his sixteenth year. He continued for another year to do it secret , in the still
remaining woods, but an old woman whom he had never seen or heard of had told. Without his
parents' consent they - the killers - had bombarded the unique nodule which had formed in his brain,
had attacked it with radioactive cobalt, and this had plunged him into a different world, one whose
existence he had never suspected. It had been a pit of corpses and dead bones and he had struggled
for years to get up from it. The donkey and especially the toad, the creatures most important to him,
had vanished, had become extinct; only rotting fragments, an eyeless head here, part of a hand there,
remained. At last a bird which had come there to die told him where he was. He had sunk down into
the tomb world. He could not get out until the bones strewn around him grew back into living
creatures; he had become joined to the metabolism of other lives and until they rose he could not rise
either.
How long that part of the cycle had lasted he did not now know; nothing had happened, generally,
so it had been measureless. But at last the bones had regained flesh; the empty eyepits had filled up

12

and the new eyes had seen, while meantime the restored beaks and mouths had cackled, barked,
and caterwauled. Possibly he had done it; perhaps the extrasensory node of his brain had finally
grown back. Or maybe he hadn't accomplished it; very likely it could have been a natural process.
Anyhow he was no longer sinking; he had begun to ascend, along with the others. Long ago he had
lost sight of them. He found himself evidently climbing alone. But they were there. They still
accompanied him; he felt them, strangely, inside him.
Isidore stood holding the two handles, experiencing himself as encompassing every other living
thing, and then, reluctantly, he let go. It had to end, as always, and anyhow his arm ached and bled
where the rock had struck it.
Releasing the handles he examined his arm, then made his way unsteadily to the bathroom of his
apartment to wash the cut off was not the first wound he had received while in fusion with Mercer
and it probably would not be the last. People, especially elderly ones, had died, particularly later on
at the top of the hill alien the torment began in earnest. I wonder if I can go through that part again,
he said to himself as he swabbed the injury. Chance of cardiac arrest; he better, he reflected, if I
lived in town where those buildings have a doctor standing by with those electro-spark machines.
Here, alone in this place, it's too risky.
But he knew he'd take the risk. He always had before. As did most people, even oldsters who
were physically fragile.
Using a Kleenex he dried his damaged arm.
And heard, muffled and far off, a TV set.
It's someone else in this building, he thought wildly, unable to believe it. Not my TV; that's off, and
I can feel the floor resonance. It's below, on another level entirely!
I'm not alone here any more, he realized. Another resident has moved in, taken one of the
abandoned apartments, and close enough for me to hear him. Must be level two or level three,
certainly no deeper. Let's see, he thought rapidly. What do you do when a new resident moves in?
Drop by and borrow something, is that how it's done? He could not remember; this had never
happened to him before, here or anywhere else: people moved out, people emigrated, but nobody
ever moved in. You take them something, he decided. Like a cup of water or rather milk; yes, it's
milk or flour or maybe an egg - or, specifically, their ersatz substitutes.
Looking in his refrigerator - the compressor had long since ceased working - he found a dubious
cube of margarine. And, with it, set off excitedly, his heart laboring, for the level below. I have to
keep calm, he realized. Not let him know I'm a chickenhead. If he finds out I'm a cliickenhead he
won't talk to me; that's always the way it is for some reason. I wonder why?
He hurried down the hall.

THREE
On his way to work Rick Deckard, as lord knew how many other people, stopped briefly to
skulk about in front of one of San Francisco's larger pet shops, along animal row. In the center of the
block-long display window an ostrich, in a heated clear-plastic cage, returned his stare. The bird,
according to the info plaque attached to the cage, had just arrived from a zoo in Cleveland. It was
the only ostrich on the West Coast. After staring at it, Rick spent a few more minutes staring grimly
at the price tag. He then continued on to the Hall of justice on Lombard Street and found himself a
quarter of an hour late to work.
As he unlocked his office door his superior Police Inspector Harry Bryant, jug-eared and
redheaded, sloppily dressed but wise-eyed and conscious of nearly everything of any importance,
hailed him. "Meet me at nine-thirty in Dave Holden's office." Inspector Bryant, as he spoke, flicked
briefly through a clipboard of onionskin typed sheets. "Holden," he continued as he started off, "is in
Mount Zion Hospital with a laser track through his spine. He'll be there for a month at least. Until
they can get one of those new organic plastic spinal sections to take hold."
"What happened?" Rick asked, chilled. The department's chief bounty hunter had been all right
yesterday; at the end of the day he had as usual zipped off in his hovercar to his apartment in the
crowded high-prestige Nob Hill area of the City.
Bryant muttered over his shoulder something about nine-thirty in Dave's office and departed,
leaving Rick standing alone.
As he entered his own office Rick heard the voice of his secretary, Ann Marsten, behind him.
"Mr. Deckard, you know what happened to Mr. Holden? He got shot." She followed after him into
the stuffy, closed-up office and set the air-filtering unit into motion.
"Yeah," he responded absently.
"It must have been one of those new, extra-clever andys the Rosen Association is turning out,"
Miss Marsten said. "Did you read over the company's brochure and the spec sheets? The Nexus-6
brain unit they're using now is capable of selecting within a field of two trillion constituents, or ten
million separate neural pathways." She lowered her voice. "You missed the vidcall this morning. Miss
Wild told me; it came through the switchboard exactly at nine."
"A call in?" Rick asked.
Miss Marsten said, "A call out by Mr. Bryant to the W.P.O. in Russia. Asking them if they would
be willing to file a formal written complaint with the Rosen Association's factory representative East."
"Harry still wants the Nexus-6 brain unit withdrawn from the market?" He felt no surprise. Since
the initial release of its specifications and performance charts back in August of 1991 most police
agencies which dealt with escaped andys had been protesting. "The Soviet police can't do any more
than we can," he said. Legally, the manufacturers of the Nexus-6 brain unit operated under colonial
law, their parent auto-factory being on Mars. "We had better just accept the new unit as a fact of
life," he said. "It's always been this way, with every improved brain unit that's come along. I
remember the howls of pain when the Sudermann people showed their old T-14 back in '89. Every
police agency in the Western Hemisphere clamored that no test would detect its presence, in an
instance of illegal entry here. As a matter of fact, for a while they were right." Over fifty of the T-14
android as he recalled had made their way by one means or another to Earth, and had not been
detected for a period in some cases up to an entire year. But then the Voigt Empathy Test had been
devised by the Pavlov Institute working in the Soviet Union. And no T-14 android - insofar, at least,
as was known - had managed to pass that particular test.

14

"Want to know what the Russian police said?" Miss Marsten asked. "I know that, too." Her
freckled, orange face glowed.
Rick said, "I'll find out from Harry Bryant." He felt irritable; office gossip annoyed him because it
always proved better than the truth. Seating himself at his desk he pointedly fished about in a drawer
until Miss Marsten, perceiving the hint, departed.
From the drawer he produced an ancient, creased manila envelope. Leaning back, tilting his
important - style chair, he rummaged among the contents of the envelope until he came across what
he wanted: the collected, extant data on the Nexus-6.
A moment's reading vindicated Miss Marsten's statement; the Nexus-6 did have two trillion
constituents plus a choice within a range of ten million possible combinations of cerebral activity. In
.45 of a second an android equipped with such a brain structure could assume any one of fourteen
basic reaction-postures. Well, no intelligence test would trap such an andy. But then, intelligence
tests hadn't trapped an andy in years, not since the primordial, crude varieties of the '70s The Nexus-6 android types, Rick reflected, surpassed several classes of human specials in terms
of intelligence. In other words, androids equipped with the new Nexus-6 brain unit had from a sort
of rough, pragmatic, no-nonsense standpoint evolved beyond a major - but inferior - segment of
mankind. For better or worse. The servant had in some cases become more adroit than its master.
But new scales of achievement, for example the Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test, had emerged as
criteria by which to judge. An android, no matter how gifted as to pure intellectual capacity, could
make no sense out of the fusion which took place routinely among the followers of Mercerism - an
experience which he, and virtually everyone else, including subnormal chickenheads, managed with
no difficulty.
He had wondered as had most people at one time or another precisely why an android bounced
helplessly about when confronted by an empathy-measuring test. Empathy, evidently, existed only
within the human community, whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every
phylum and order including the arachnids. For one thing, the emphatic faculty probably required an
unimpaired group instinct; a solitary organism, such as a spider, would have no use for it; in fact it
would tend to abort a spider's ability to survive. It would make him conscious of the desire to live on
the part of his prey. Hence all predators, even highly developed mammals such as cats, would starve.
Empathy, he once had decided, must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could
depart from a meat diet. Because, ultimatley, the emphatic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter
and victim, between the successful and the defeated. As in the fusion with Mercer, everyone
ascended together or, when the cycle had come to an end, fell together into the trough of the tomb
world. Oddly, it resembled a sort of biological insurance, but double-edged. As long as some
creature experienced joy, then the condition for all other creatures included a fragment of joy.
However, if any living being suffered, then for all the rest the shadow could not be entirely cast off. A
herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this; an owl or a cobra would
be destroyed.
Evidently the humanoid robot constituted a solitary predator.
Rick liked to think of them that way; it made his job palatable. In retiring - i.e. killing - an andy he
did not violate the rule of life laid down by Mercer. You shall kill only the killers, Mercer had told
them the year empathy boxes first appeared on Earth. And in Mercerism, as it evolved into a full
theology, the concept of The Killers had grown insidiously. In Mercerism, an absolute evil plucked at
the threadbare cloak of the tottering, ascending old man, but it was never clear who or what this evil
presence was. A Mercerite sensed evil without understanding it. Put another way, a Mercerite was
free to locate the nebulous presence of The Killers wherever he saw fit. For Rick Deckard an

15

escaped humanoid robot, which had killed its master, which had been equipped with an intelligence
greater than that of many human beings, which had no regard for animals, which possessed no ability
to feel emphatic joy for another life form's success or grief at its defeat - that, for him, epitomized
The Killers.
Thinking about animals reminded him of the ostrich he had seen in the pet store. Temporarily he
pushed away the specs on the Nexus-6 brain unit, took a pinch of Mrs. Siddons' No. 3 & 4 snuff
and cogitated. Then he examined his watch, saw that he had time; he picked up his desk vidphone
and said to Miss Marsten, "Get me the Happy Dog Pet Shop on Sutter Street."
"Yes sir," Miss Marsten said, and opened her phone book.
They can't really want that much for the ostrich, Rick said to himself. They expect you to cartrade, like in the old days.
"Happy Dog Pet Shop," a man's voice declared, and on Rick's vidscreen a minute happy face
appeared. Animals could be heard bawling.
"That ostrich you have in your display window," Rich said; he toyed with a ceramic ashtray before
him on the desk. "What sort of a down payment would I need for that?"
"Let's see," the animal salesman said, groping for a pen and pad of paper. "One-third down." He
figured. "May I ask, sit, if you're going to trade something in?
Guardedly, Rick said, "I haven't decided."
"Let's say we put the ostrich on a thirty-month contract," the salesman said. "At a low, low interest
rate of six percent a month. That would make your monthly payment, after a reasonable down - "
"You'll have to lower the price you're asking," Rick said. Knock off two thousand and I won't
trade anything in; I'll come up with cash." Dave Holden, he reflected, is out of action. That could
mean a great deal . . . depending on how many assignments show up during the coming month.
"Sir," the animal salesman said, "our asking price is already a thousand dollars under book. Check
your Sidney's; I'll hang on. I want you to see for yourself, sir, that our price is fair."
Christ, Rick thought. They're standing firm. However, just for the heck of it, he wiggled his bent
Sidney's out of his coat pocket, thumbed to ostrich comma male-female, old-young, sick-well, mintused, and inspected the prices.
"Mint, male, young, well," the salesman informed him. "Thirty thousand dollars." He, too, had his
Sidney's out. "We're exactly one thousand under book. Now, your down payment - "
"I'll think it over," Rick said, "and call you back." He started to hang up.
"Your name, sir?" the salesman asked alertly.
"Frank Merriwell," Rick said.
"And your address, Mr. Merriwell? In case I'm not here when you call back."
He made up an address and put the vidphone receiver back on its cradle. All that money, he
thought. And yet, people buy them; some people have that kind of money. Picking up the receiver
again he said harshly, "Give me an outside line, Miss Marsten. And don't listen in on the
conversation; it's confidential." He glared at her.
"Yes, sir," Miss Marsten said. "Go ahead and dial." She then cut herself out of the circuit, leaving
him to face the outside world.
He dialed - by memory - the number of the false-animal shop at which he had gotten his ersatz
sheep. On the small vidscreen a man dressed like a vet appeared. "Dr. McRae," the man declared.
"This is Deckard. How much is an electric ostrich?"
"Oh, I'd say we could fix you up for less than eight hundred dollars. How soon did you want
delivery? We would have to make it up for you; there's not that much call for - "

16

"I'll talk to you later," Rick interrupted; glancing at his watch he saw that nine-thirty had arrived.
"Good-by." He hurriedly hung up, rose, and shortly thereafter stood before Inspector Bryant's office
door. He passed by Bryant's receptionist - attractive, with waist-length braided silver hair - and then
the inspector's secretary, an ancient monster from the Jurassic swamp, frozen and sly, like some
archaic apparition fixated in the tomb world. Neither woman spoke to him nor he to them. Opening
the inner door he nodded to his superior, who was busy on the phone; seating himself he got out the
specs on Nexus-6, which he had brought with him, and once more read them over as Inspector
Bryant talked away He felt depressed. And yet, logically, because of Dave's sudden disappearance from the work
scene, he should be at least guardedly pleased.

17

FOUR
Maybe I'm worried, Rick Deckard conjectured, that what happened to Dave will happen to me.
An andy smart enough to laser him could probably take me, too. But that didn't seem to be it.
"I see you brought the poop sheet on that new brain unit," Inspector Bryant said, hanging up the
vidphone.
Rick said, "Yeah, I heard about it on the grapevine. How many andys are involved and how far
did Dave get?"
"Eight to start with," Bryant said, consulting his clipboard. "Dave got the first two."
"And the remaining six are here in Northern California?"
"As far as we know. Dave thinks so. That was him I was talking to. I have his notes; they were in
his desk. He says all he knows is here." Bryant tapped the bundle of notepaper. So far he did not
seem inclined to pass the notes on to Rick; for some reason he continued to leaf through them
himself, frowning and working his tongue in and around the fringes of his mouth.
"I have nothing on I my agenda," Rick offered. "I'm ready to take over in Dave's place."
Bryant said thoughtfully, "Dave used the Voigt-Kampff Altered Scale in testing out the individuals
he suspected. You realize - you ought to, anyhow - that this test isn't specific for the new brain units.
No test is; the Voigt scale, altered three years ago by Kampff, is all we have." He paused,
pondering. "Dave considered it accurate. Maybe it is. But I would suggest this, before you take out
after these six." Again he tapped the pile of notes. "Fly to Seattle and talk with the Rosen people.
Have them supply you a representative sampling of types employing the new Nexus-6 unit."
"And put them through the Voigt-Kampff," Rick said.
"It sounds so easy," Bryant said, half to himself.
"Pardon?"
Bryant said, "I think I'll talk to the Rosen organization myself, while you're on your way." He eyed
Rick, then, silently. Finally he grunted, gnawed on a fingernail, and eventually decided on what he
wanted to say. "I'm going to discuss with them the possibility of including several humans, as well as
their new androids. But you won't know. It'll be my decision, in conjunction with the manufacturers.
It should be set up by the time you get there." He abruptly pointed at Rick, his face severe. "This is
the first time you'll be acting as senior bounty bunter. Dave knows a lot; he's got years of experience
behind him."
"So have I," Rick said tensely.
"You've handled assignments devolving to you from Dave's schedule; he's always decided exactly
which ones to turn over to you and which not to. But now you've got six that he intended to retire
himself - one of which managed to get him first. This one." Bryant turned the notes around so that
Rick could see. "Max Polokov," Bryant said. "That's what it calls itself, anyhow. Assuming Dave was
right. Everything is based on that assumption, this entire list. And yet the Voigt-Kampff Altered Scale
has only been administered to the first three, the two Dave retired and then Polokov. It was while
Dave was administering the test; that's when Polokov lasered him."
"Which proves that Dave was right," Rick said. Otherwise he would not have been lasered;
Polokov would have no motive.
"You get started for Seattle," Bryant said. "Don't tell them first; I'll handle it. Listen." He rose to his
feet, soberly confronted Rick. "When you run the Voigt-Kampff scale up there, if one of the humans
fails to pass it - "
"That can't happen," Rick said.

18

"One day, a few weeks ago, I talked with Dave about exactly that. He had been thinking along the
same lines. I had a memo from the Soviet police, W.P.O. itself, circulated throughout Earth plus the
colonies. A group of psychiatrists in Leningrad have approached W.P.O. with the following
proposition. They want the latest and most accurate personality profile analytical tools used in
determining the presence of an android - in other words the Voigt-Kampff scaleapplied to a carefully
selected group of schizoid and schizophrenic human patients. Those, specifically, which reveal what's
called a 'flattening of affect.' You've heard of that."
Rick said, "That's specifically what the scale measures."
"Then you understand what they're worried about."
"This problem has always existed. Since we first encountered androids posing as humans. The
consensus of police opinion is known to you in Lurie Kampff s article, written eight years ago. Roletaking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic. Kampff compared the diminished emphatic
faculty found in human mental patients and a superficially similar but basically - "
"The Leningrad psychiatrists," Bryant broke in brusquely, "think that a small class of human beings
could not pass the Voigt-Kampff scale. If you tested them in line with police work you'd assess them
as humanoid robots. You'd be wrong, but by then they'd be dead." He was silent, now, waiting for
Rick's answer.
"But these individuals," Rick said, "would all be - "
"They'd be in institutions," Bryant agreed. "They couldn't conceivably function in the outside world;
they certainly couldn't go undetected as advanced psychotics - unless of course their breakdown had
come recently and suddenly and no one had gotten around to noticing. But this could happen."
"A million to one odds," Rick said. But he saw the point.
"What worried Dave," Bryant continued, "is this appearance of the new Nexus-6 advance type.
The Rosen organization assured us, as you know, that a Nexus-6 could be delineated by standard
profile tests. We took their word for it. Now we're forced, as we knew we would be, to determine it
on our own. That's what you'll be doing in Seattle. You understand, don't you that this could go
wrong either way. If you can't pick out all the humanoid robots, then we have no reliable analytical
tool and we'll never find the ones who're already escaping. If your scale factors out a human subject,
identifies him as android - " Bryant beamed at him icily. "It would be awkward, although no one,
absolutely not the Rosen people, will make the news public. Actually we'll be able to sit on it
indefinitely, although of course we'll have to inform W.P.O. and they in turn will notify Leningrad.
Eventually it'll pop out of the 'papes at us. But by then we may have developed a better scale." He
picked the phone up. "You want to get started? Use a department car and fuel yourself at our
pumps."
Standing, Rick said, "Can I take Dave Holden's notes with me? I want to read them along the
way."
Bryant said, "Let's wait until you've tried out your scale in Seattle." His tone was interestingly
merciless, and Rick Deckard noted it.
When he landed the police department hovercar on the roof of the Rosen Association Building in
Seattle he found a young woman waiting for him. Black-haired and slender, wearing the new huge
dust-filtering glasses, she approached his car, her hands deep in the pockets of her brightly striped
long coat. She had, on her sharply defined small face, an expression of sullen distaste.
"What's the matter?" Rick said as he stepped from the parked car.

19

The girl said, obliquely, "Oh, I don't know. Something about the way we got talked to on the
phone. It doesn't matter." Abruptly she held out her hand; he reflexively took it. "I'm Rachael Rosen.
I guess you're Mr. Deckard."
"This is not my idea," he said.
"Yes, Inspector Bryant told us that. But you're officially the San Francisco Police Department, and
it doesn't believe our unit is to the public benefit." She eyed him from beneath long black lashes,
probably artificial.
Rick said, "A humanoid robot is like any other machine; it can fluctuate between being a benefit
and a hazard very rapidly. As a benefit it's not our problem."
"But as a hazard," Rachael Rosen said, "then you come in. Is it true, Mr. Deckard, that you're a
bounty hunter?"
He shrugged, with reluctance, nodded.
"You have no difficulty viewing an android as inert," the girl said. "So you can 'retire' it, as they
say."
"Do you have the group selected out for me?" he said. "I'd like to - " He broke off. Because, all at
once, he had seen their animals.
A powerful corporation, he realized, would of course be able to afford this. In the back of his
mind, evidently, he had anticipated such a collection; it was not surprise that he felt but more a sort of
yearning. He quietly walked away from the girl, toward the closest pen. Already he could smell them,
the several scents of the creatures standing or sitting, or, in the case of what appeared to be a
raccoon, asleep.
Never in his life had he personally seen a raccoon. He knew the animal only from 3-D films shown
on television. For some reason the dust had struck that species almost as hard as it had the birds - of
which almost none survived, now. In an automatic response he brought out his much - thumbed
Sidney's and looked up raccoon with all the sublistings. The list prices, naturally, appeared in italics;
like Percheron horses, none existed on the market for sale at any figure. Sidney's catalogue simply
listed the price at which the last transaction involving a raccoon had taken place. It was astronomical.
"His name is Bill," the girl said from behind him. "Bill the raccoon. We acquired him just last year
from a subsidiary corporation." She pointed past him and he then perceived the armed company
guards, standing with their machine guns, the rapid-fire little light Skoda issue; the eyes of the guards
had been fastened on him since his car landed. And, he thought, my car is clearly marked as a police
vehicle.
"A major manufacturer of androids," he said thoughtfully, "invests its surplus capital on living
animals."
"Look at the owl," Rachael Rosen said. "Here, I'll wake it up for you." She started toward a small,
distant cage, in the center of which jutted up a branching dead tree.
There are no owls, he started to say. Or so we've been told. Sidney's, he thought; they list it in
their catalogue as extinct: the tiny, precise type, the E, again and again throughout the catalogue. As
the girl walked ahead of him he checked to see, and he was right. Sidney's never makes a mistake,
he said to himself. We know that, too. What else can we depend on?
"It's artificial," he said, with sudden realization; his disappointment welled up keen and intense.
"No." She smiled and he saw that she had small even teeth, as white as her eyes and hair were
black.
"But Sidney's listing," he said, trying to show her the catalogue. To prove it to her.
The girl said, "We don't buy from Sidney's or from any animal dealer. All our purchases are from
private parties and the prices we pay aren't reported." She added, "Also we have our own

20

naturalists; they're now working up in Canada. There's still a good deal of forest left, comparatively
speaking, anyhow. Enough for small animals and once in a while a bird."
For a long time he stood gazing at the owl, who dozed on its perch. A thousand thoughts came
into his mind, thoughts about the war, about the days when owls had fallen from the sky; he
remembered how in his childhood it had been discovered that species upon species had become
extinct and how the 'papes had reported it each day - foxes one morning, badgers the next, until
people had stopped reading the perpetual animal obits.
He thought, too, about his need for a real animal; within him an actual hatred once more
manifested itself toward his electric sheep, which he had to tend, had to care about, as if it lived. The
tyranny of an object, he thought. It doesn't know I exist. Like the androids, it had no ability to
appreciate the existence of another. He had never thought of this before, the similarity between an
electric animal and an andy. The electric animal, he pondered, could be considered a subform of the
other, a kind of vastly inferior robot. Or, conversely, the android could be regarded as a highly
developed, evolved version of the ersatz animal. Both viewpoints repelled him.
"If you sold your owl," he said to the girl Rachael Rosen, "how much would you want for it, and
how much of that down?"
"We would never sell our owl." She scrutinized him with a mixture of pleasure and pity; or so he
read her expression. "And even if we sold it, you couldn't possibly pay the price. What kind of
animal do you have at home?"
"A sheep," he said. "A black-faced Suffolk ewe."
"Well, then you should be happy."
"I'm happy," he answered. "It's just that I always wanted an owl, even back before they all
dropped dead." He corrected himself. "All but yours."
Rachael said, "Our present crash program and overall planning call for us to obtain an additional
owl which can nate with Scrappy." She indicated the owl dozing on its perch; it had briefly opened
both eyes, yellow slits which healed over as the owl settled back down to resume its slumber. Its
chest rose conspicuously and fell, as if the owl, in its hypnagogic state, had sighed.
Breaking away from the sight - k made absolute bitterness blend throughout his prior reaction of
awe and yearninghe said, "I'd like to test out the selection, now. Can we go downstairs? "
"My uncle took the call from your superior and by now he probably has - "
"You're a family?" Rick broke in. "A corporation this large is a family affair?"
Continuing her sentence, Rachael said, "Uncle Eldon should have an android group and a control
group set up by now. So let's go." She strode toward the elevator, hands again thrust violently in the
pockets of her coat; she did not look back, and he hesitated for a moment, feeling annoyance,
before he at last trailed after her.
"What have you got against me?" he asked her as together they descended.
She reflected, as if up to now she hadn't known. "Well," she said, "you, a little police department
employee, are in a unique position. Know what I mean?" She gave him a malice-filled sidelong
glance.
"How much of your current output," he asked, "consists of types equipped with the Nexus-6?"
"All," Rachael said.
"I'm sure the Voigt-Kampff scale will work with them."
"And if it doesn't we'll have to withdraw all Nexus-6 types from the market." Her black eyes
flamed up; she glowered at him as the elevator ceased descending and its doors slid back. "Because
you police departments can't do an adequate job in the simple matter of detecting the minuscule
number of Nexus-6s who balk - "

21

A man, dapper and lean and elderly, approached them, hand extended; on his face a harried
expression showed, as if everything recently had begun happening too fast. "I'm Eldon Rosen," he
explained to Rick as they shook hands. "Listen, Deckard; you realize we don't manufacture anything
here on Earth, right? We can't just phone down to production and ask for a diverse flock of items;
it's not that we don't want or intend to cooperate with you. Anyhow I've done the best I can." His
left hand, shakily, roved through his thinning hair.
Indicating his department briefcase, Rick said, "I'm ready to start. The senior Rosen's nervousness
buoyed up his own confidence. They're afraid of me, he realized with a start. Rachael Rosen
included. I can probably force them to abandon manufacture of their Nexus-6 types; what I do
during the next hour will affect the structure of their operation. It could conceivably determine the
future of the Rosen Association, here in the United States, in Russia, and on Mars.
The two members of the Rosen family studied him apprehensively and he felt the hollowness of
their manner; by coming here he had brought the void to them, had ushered in emptiness and the
hush of economic death. They control inordinate power, he thought. This enterprise is considered
one of the system's industrial pivots; the manufacture of androids, in fact, has become so linked to
the colonization effort that if one dropped into ruin, so would the other in time. The Rosen
Association, naturally, understood this perfectly. Eldon Rosen had obviously been conscious of it
since Harry Bryant's call.
"I wouldn't worry if I were you," Rick said as the two Rosens led him down a highly illuminated
wide corridor. He himself felt quietly content. This moment, more than any other which he could
remember, pleased him. Well, they would all soon know what his testing apparatus could accomplish
- and could not. "If you have no confidence in the Voigt-Kampff scale," he pointed out, "possibly
your organization should have researched an alternate test. It can be argued that the responsibility
rests partly on you. Oh, thanks." The Rosens had steered him from the corridor and into a chic, living
roomish cubicle furnished with carpeting, lamps, couch, and modern little end - tables on which
rested recent magazines . . . including, he noticed, the February supplement to the Sidney's
catalogue, which he personally had not seen. In fact, the February supplement wouldn't be out for
another three days. Obviously the Rosen Association had a special relationship with Sidney's.
Annoyed, he picked up the supplement. "This is a violation of public trust. Nobody should get
advance news of price changes." As a matter of fact this might violate a federal statute; he tried to
remember the relevant law, found he could not. "I'm taking this with me," he said, and, opening his
briefcase, dropped the supplement within.
After an interval of silence, Eldon Rosen said wearily, "Look, officer, it hasn't been our policy to
solicit advance - "
"I'm not a peace officer," Rick said. "I'm a bounty hunter." From his opened briefcase he fished
out the Voigt-Kampff apparatus, seated himself at a nearby rosewood coffee table, and began to
assemble the rather simple polygraphic instruments. "You may send the first testee in," he informed
Eldon Rosen, who now looked more haggard than ever.
"I'd like to watch," Rachael said, also seating herself. "I've never seen an empathy test being
administered. What do those things you have there measure?"
Rick said, "This" - he held up the flat adhesive disk with its trailing wires - "measures capillary
dilation in the facial area. We know this to be a primary autonomic response, the so - called 'shame'
or 'blushing' reaction to a morally shocking stimulus. It can't be controlled voluntarily, as can skin
conductivity, respiration, and cardiac rate." He showed her the other instrument, a pencil-beam light.
"This records fluctuations of tension within the eye muscles. Simultaneous with the blush phenomenon
there generally can be found a small but detectable movement of - "

22

"And these can't be found in androids," Rachael said.
"They're not engendered by the stimuli-questions; no. Although biologically they exist. Potentially."
Rachael said, "Give me the test."
"Why?" Rick said, puzzled.
Speaking up, Eldon Rosen said hoarsely, "We selected her as your first subject. She may be an
android. We're hoping you can tell." He seated himself in a series of clumsy motions, got out a
cigarette, lit it and fixedly watched.

23

FIVE
The small beam of white light shone steadily into the left eye of Rachael Rosen, and against her
cheek the wire-mesh disk adhered. She seemed calm.
Seated where he could catch the readings on the two gauges of the Voigt-Kampff testing
apparatus, Rick Deckard said, "I'm going to outline a number of social situations. You are to express
your reaction to each as quickly as possible. You will be timed, of course."
"And of course," Rachael said distantly, "my verbal responses won't count. It's solely the eyemuscle and capillary reaction that you'll use as indices. But I'll answer; I want to go through this and " She broke off. "Go ahead, Mr. Deckard."
Rick, selecting question three, said, "You are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday." Both
gauges immediately registered past the green and onto the red; the needles swung violently and then
subsided.
"I wouldn't accept it," Rachael said. "Also I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police."
After making a jot of notation Rick continued, turning to the eighth question of the Voigt-Kampff
profile scale. "You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing jar."
"I'd take him to the doctor." Rachael's voice was low but firm. Again the twin gauges registered,
but this time not so far. He made a note of that, too.
"You're sitting watching TV," he continued, "and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your
wrist."
Rachael said, "I'd kill it." The gauges, this time, registered almost nothing: only a feeble and
momentary tremor. He noted that and hunted cautiously for the next question.
"In a magazine you come across a full-page color picture of a nude girl." He paused.
"Is this testing whether I'm an android," Rachael asked tartly, "or whether I'm homosexual?" The
gauges did not register.
He continued, "Your husband likes the picture." Still the gauges failed to indicate a reaction. "The
girl," he added, "is lying face down on a large and beautiful bearskin rug." The gauges remained inert,
and he said to himself, An android response. Failing to detect the major element, the dead animal
pelt. Her - its - mind is concentrating on other factors. "Your husband hangs the picture up on the
wall of his study," he finished, and this time the needles moved.
"I certainly wouldn't let him," Rachael said.
"Okay," he said, nodding. "Now consider this. You're reading a novel written in the old days
before the war. The characters are visiting Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. They become
hungry and enter a seafood restaurant. One of them orders lobster, and the chef drops the lobster
into the tub of boiling water while the characters watch."
"Oh god," Rachael said. "That's awful! Did they really do that? It's depraved! You mean a live
lobster?" The gauges, however, did not respond. Formally, a correct response. But simulated.
"You rent a mountain cabin," he said, "in an area still verdant. It's rustic knotty pine with a huge
fireplace."
"Yes," Rachael said, nodding impatiently.
"On the walls someone has hung old maps, Currier and Ives prints, and above the fireplace a
deer's head has been mounted, a full stag with developed horns. The people with you admire the
decor of the cabin and you all decide - "
"Not with the deer head," Rachael said. The gauges, however, showed an amplitude within the
green only.

24

"You become pregnant," Rick continued, "by a man who has promised to marry you. The man
goes off with another woman, your best friend; you get an abortion and - "
"I would never get an abortion," Rachael said. "Anyhow you can't. It's a life sentence and the
police are always watching." This time both needles swung violently into the red.
"How do you know that?" Rick asked her, curiously. "About the difficulty of obtaining an
abortion?"
"Everybody knows that," Rachael answered.
"It sounded like you spoke from personal experience."' He watched the needles intently; they still
swept out a wide path across the dials. "One more. You're dating a man and he asks you to visit his
apartment. While you're there he offers you a drink. As you stand holding your glass you see into the
bedroom; it's attractively decorated with bullfight posters, and you wander in to look closer. He
follows after you, closing the door. Putting his arm around you, he says - "
Rachael interrupted, "What's a bullfight poster?"
"Drawings, usually in color and very large, showing a matador with his cape, a bull trying to gore
him." He was puzzled. "How old are you?" he asked; that might be a factor.
"I'm eighteen," Rachael said. "Okay; so this man closes the door and puts his arm around me.
What does he say?"
Rick said, "Do you know how bullfights ended;"
"I suppose somebody got hurt."
"The bull at the end, was always killed." He waited, watching the two needles. They palpitated
restlessly, nothing more. No real reading at all. "A final question," he said. "Two-part. You are
watching an old movie on TV, a movie from before the war. It shows a banquet in progress; the
guests are enjoying raw oysters."
"Ugh," Rachael said; the needles swung swiftly.
"The entree," he continued, "consists of boiled dog, stuffed with rice." The needles moved less this
time, less than they had for the raw oysters. "Are raw oysters more acceptable to you than a dish of
boiled dog? Evidently not." He put his pencil down, shut off the beam of light, removed the adhesive
patch from her check. "You're an android," he said. "That's the conclusion of the testing," he
informed her - or rather it - and Eldon Rosen, who regarded him with writhing worry; the elderly
man's face contorted, shifted plastically with angry concern. "I'm right, aren't I?" Rick said. There
was no answer, from either of the Rosens. "Look," he said reasonably. "We have no conflict of
interest; it's important to me that the Voigt-Kampff test functions, almost as important as it is to you."
The elder Rosen said, "She's not an android."
"I don't believe it," Rick said.
"Why would he lie?" Rachael said to Rick fiercely. "If anything, we'd lie the other way."
"I want a bone marrow analysis made of you," Rick said to her. "It can eventually be organically
determined whether you're android or not; it's slow and painful, admittedly, but - "
"Legally," Rachael said, "I can't be forced to undergo a bone marrow test. That's been established
in the courts; self-incrimination. And anyhow on a live person - not the corpse of a retired android it takes a long time. You can give that damn Voigt-Kampff profile test because of the specials; they
have to be tested for constantly, and while the government was doing that you police agencies
slipped the Voigt-Kampff through. But what you said is true; that's the end of the testing." She rose
to her feet, paced away from him, and stood with her hands on her hips, her back to him.
"The issue is not the legality of the bone marrow analysis," Eldon Rosen said huskily. "The issue is
that your empathy delineation test failed in response to my niece. I can explain why she scored as an
android might. Rachael grew up aboard Salander 3. She was born on it; she spent fourteen of her

25

eighteen years living off its tape library and what the nine other crew members, all adults, knew about
Earth. Then, as you know, the ship turned back a sixth of the way to Proxima. Otherwise Rachael
would never have seen Earth - anyhow not until her later life."
"You would have retired me," Rachael said over her shoulder. "In a police dragnet I would have
been killed. I've known that since I got here four years ago; this isn't the first time the Voigt-Kampff
test has been given to me. In fact I rarely leave this building; the risk is enormous, because of those
roadblocks you police set up, those flying wedge spot checks to pick up unclassified specials."
"And androids," Eldon Rosen added. "Although naturally the public isn't told that; they're not
supposed to know that androids are on Earth, in our midst."
"I don't think they are," Rick said. "I think the various police agencies here and in the Soviet Union
have gotten them all. The population is small enough now; everyone, sooner or later, runs into a
random checkpoint." That, anyhow, was the idea.
"What were your instructions," Eldon Rosen asked, "if you wound up designating a human as
android?"
"That's a departmental matter." He began restoring his testing gear to his briefcase; the two
Rosens watched silently. "Obviously," he added, "I was told to cancel further testing, as I'm now
doing. If it failed once there's no point in going on." He snapped the briefcase shut.
"We could have defrauded you," Rachael said. "Nothing forced us to admit you mistested me.
And the same for the other nine subjects we've selected." She gestured vigorously. "All we had to do
was simply go along with your test results, either way."
Rick said, "I would have insisted on a list in advance. A sealed-envelope breakdown. And
compared my own test results for congruity. There would have had to be congruity." And I can see
now, he realized, that I wouldn't have gotten it. Bryant was right. Thank god I didn't go out bounty
hunting on the basis of this test.
"Yes, I suppose you would have done that," Eldon Rosen said. He glanced at Rachael, who
nodded. "We discussed that possibility," Eldon said, then, with reluctance.
"This problem," Rick said, "stems entirely from your method of operation, Mr. Rosen. Nobody
forced your organization to evolve the production of humanoid robots to a point where - "
"We produced what the colonists wanted," Eldon Rosen said. "We followed the time-honored
principle underlying every commercial venture. If our firm hadn't made these progressively more
human types, other firms in the field would have. We knew the risk we were taking when we
developed the Nexus-6 brain unit. But your Voigt-Kampff test was a failure before we released that
type of android. If you had failed to classify a Nexus-6 android as an android, if you had checked it
out as human - but that's not what happened." His voice had become hard and bitingly penetrating.
"Your police department - others as well - may have retired, very probably have retired, authentic
humans with underdeveloped empathic ability, such as my innocent niece here. Your position, Mr.
Deckard, is extremely bad morally. Ours isn't."
"In other words," Rick said with acuity, "I'm not going to be given a chance to check out a single
Nexus-6. You people dropped this schizoid girl on me beforehand." And my test, he realized, is
wiped out. I shouldn't have gone for it, he said to himself. However, it's too late now.
"We have you, Mr. Deckard," Rachael Rosen agreed in a quiet, reasonable voice; she turned
toward him, then, and smiled.
He could not make out, even now, how the Rosen Association had managed to snare him, and so
easily. Experts, he realized. A mammoth corporation like this - it embodies too much experience. It
possesses in fact a sort of group mind. And Eldon and Rachael Rosen consisted of spokesmen for

26

that corporate entity. His mistake, evidently, had been in viewing them as individuals. It was a
mistake he would not make again.
"Your superior Mr. Bryant," Eldon Rosen said, "will have difficulty understanding how you
happened to let us void your testing apparatus before the test began." He pointed toward the ceiling,
and Rick saw the camera lens. His massive error in dealing with the Rosens had been recorded. "I
think the right thing for us all to do," Eldon said, "is sit down and - " He gestured affably. "We can
work something out, Mr. Deckard. There's no need for anxiety. The Nexus-6 variety of android is a
fact; we here at the Rosen Association recognize it and I think now you do, too."
Rachael, leaning toward Rick, said, 'How would you like to own an owl?
"I doubt if I'll ever own an owl." But he knew what she meant; he understood the business the
Rosen Association wanted to transact. Tension of a kind he had never felt before manifested itself
inside him; it exploded, leisurely, in every part of his body. He felt the tension, the consciousness of
what was happening, take over completely.
"But an owl," Eldon Rosen said, "is the thing you want." He glanced at his niece inquiringly. "I
don't think he has any idea - "
"Of course he does," Rachael contradicted. "He knows exactly where this is heading. Don't you,
Mr. Deckard?" Again she leaned toward him, and this time closer; he could smell a mild perfume
about her, almost a warmth. "You're practically there, Mr. Deckard. You practically have your owl."
To Eldon Rosen she said, "He's a bounty hunter; remember? So he lives off the bounty he makes,
not his salary. Isn't that so, Mr. Deckard?"
He nodded.
"How many androids escaped this time?" Rachael inquired.
Presently he said, "Eight. Originally. Two have already been retired, by someone else; not me."
"You get how much for each android?" Rachael asked.
Shrugging, he said, "It varies."
Rachael said, "If you have no test you can administer, then there is no way you can identify an
android. And if there's no way you can identify an android there's no way you can collect your
bounty. So if the Voigt-Kampff scale has to be abandoned - "
"A new scale," Rick said, "will replace it. This has happened before." Three times, to be exact.
But the new scale, the more modern analytical device, had been there already; no lag had existed.
This time was different.
"Eventually, of course, the Voigt-Kampff scale will become obsolete," Rachael agreed. "But not
now. We're satisfied ourselves that it will delineate the Nexus-6 types and we'd like you to proceed
on that basis in your own particular, peculiar work." Rocking back and forth, her arms tightly folded,
she regarded him with intensity. Trying to fathom his reaction.
"Tell him he can have his owl," Eldon Rosen grated.
"You can have the owl," Rachael said, still eyeing him. "The one up on the roof. Scrappy. But we
will want to mate it if we can get our hands on a male. And any offspring will be ours; that has to be
absolutely understood."
Rick said, "I'll divide the brood."
"No," Rachael said instantly; behind her Eldon Rosen shook his head, backing her up. "That way
you'd have claim to the sole bloodline of owls for the rest of eternity. And there's another condition.
You can't will your owl to anybody; at your death it reverts back to the association."
"That sounds," Rick said, "like an invitation for you to come in and kill me. To get your owl back
immediately. I won't agree to that; it's too dangerous."

27

"You're a bounty hunter," Rachael said. "You can handle a laser gun - in fact you're carrying one
right now. If you can't protect yourself, how are you going to retire the six remaining Nexus-6 andys?
They're a good deal smarter than the Grozzi Corporation's old W-4."
"But I hunt them," he said. "This way, with a reversion clause on the owl, someone would be
hunting me." And he did not like the idea of being stalked; he had seen the effect on androids. It
brought about certain notable changes, even in them.
Rachael said, "All right; we'll yield on that. You can will the owl to your heirs. But we insist on
getting the complete brood. If you can't agree to that, go on back to San Francisco and admit to
your superiors in the department that the Voigt-Kampff scale, at least as administered by you, can't
distinguish an andy from a human being. And then look for another job."
"Give me some time," Rick said.
"Okay," Rachael said. "We'll leave you in here, where it's comfortable." She examined her
wristwatch.
"Half an hour," Eldon Rosen said. He and Rachael filed toward the door of the room, silently.
They had said what they intended to say, he realized; the rest lay in his lap.
As Rachael started to close the door after herself and her uncle, Rick said starkly, "You managed
to set me up perfectly. You have it on tape that I missed on you; you know that my job depends on
the use of the Voigt-Kampff scale; and you own that goddamn owl."
"Your owl, dear," Rachael said. "Remember? We'll tie your home address around its leg and have
it fly down to San Francisco; it'll meet you there when you get off work."
It, he thought. She keeps calling the owl it. Not her. "Just a second," he said.
Pausing at the door, Rachael said, "You've decided?"
"I want," he said, opening his briefcase, "to ask you one more question from the Voigt-Kampff
scale. Sit down again."
Rachael glanced at her uncle; he nodded and she grudgingly returned, seating herself as before.
"What's this for?" she demanded, her eyebrows lifted in distaste - and wariness. He perceived her
skeletal tension, noted it professionally.
Presently he had the pencil of light trained on her right eye and the adhesive patch again in contact
with her check. Rachael stared into the light rigidly, the expression of extreme distaste still manifest.
"My briefcase," Rick said as he rummaged for the Voigt-Kampff forms. "Nice, isn't it?
Department issue."
"Well, well," Rachael said remotely.
"Babyhide," Rick said. He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase. "One hundred
percent genuine human babyhide." He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically. But only after a
pause. The reaction had come, but too late. He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a
second, the correct reaction period; there should have been none. "Thanks, Miss Rosen," he said,
and gathered together the equipment again; he had concluded his retesting. "That's all."
"You're leaving?" Rachael asked.
"Yes," he said. "I'm satisfied."
Cautiously, Rachael said, "What about the other nine subjects?"
"The scale has been adequate in your case," he answered. "I can extrapolate from that; it's clearly
still effective." To Eldon Rosen, who slumped morosely by the door of the room, he said, "Does she
know?" Sometimes they didn't; false memories had been tried various times, generally in the mistaken
idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered.
Eldon Rosen said, "No. We programmed her completely.

28

But I think toward the end she suspected." To the girl he said, "You guessed when he asked for
one more try."
Pale, Rachael nodded fixedly.
"Don't be afraid of him," Eldon Rosen told her. "You're not an escaped android on Earth illegally;
you're the property of the Rosen Association, used as a sales device for prospective emigrants." He
walked to the girl, put his hand comfortingly on her shoulder; at the touch the girl flinched.
"He's right," Rick said. "I'm not going to retire you, Miss Rosen. Good day." He started toward
the door, then halted briefly. To the two of them he said, "is the owl genuine?"
Rachael glanced swiftly at the elder Rosen.
"He's leaving anyhow," Eldon Rosen said. "It doesn't matter; the owl is artificial. There are no
owls."
"Hmm," Rick muttered, and stepped numbly out into the corridor. The two of them watched him
go. Neither said anything. Nothing remained to say. So that's how the largest manufacturer of
androids operates, Rick said to himself. Devious, and in a manner he had never encountered before.
A weird and convoluted new personality type; no wonder law enforcement agencies were having
trouble with the Nexus-6.
The Nexus-6. He had now come up against it. Rachael, he realized; she must be a Nexus-6. I'm
seeing one of them for the first time. And they damn near did it; they came awfully damn close to
undermining the Voigt-Kampff scale, the only method we have for detecting them. The Rosen
Association does a good job - makes a good try, anyhow - at protecting its products.
And I have to face six more of them, he reflected. Before I'm finished.
He would earn the bounty money. Every cent.
Assuming he made it through alive.

SIX
The TV set boomed; descending the great empty apartment building's dust-stricken stairs to the
level below, John Isidore made out now the familiar voice of Buster Friendly, burbling happily to his
system-wide vast audience.
" - ho ho, folks! Zip click zip! Time for a brief note on tomorrow's weather; first the Eastern
seaboard of the U.S.A. Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward
noon and then will taper off. So all you dear folks who'll be venturing out ought to wait until
afternoon, eh? And speaking of waiting, it's now only ten hours 'til that big piece of news, my special
exposé! Tell your friends to watch! I'm revealing something that'll amaze you. Now, you might guess
that it's just the usual - "
As Isidore knocked on the apartment door the television died immediately into nonbeing. It had
not merely become silent; it had stopped existing, scared into its grave by his knock.
He sensed, behind the closed door, the presence of life, beyond that of the TV. His straining
faculties manufactured or else picked up a haunted, tongueless fear, by someone retreating from him,
someone blown back to the farthest wall of the apartment in an attempt to evade him.
"Hey," he called. "I live upstairs. I heard your TV. Let's meet; okay?" He waited, listening. No
sound and no motion; his words had not pried the person loose. "I brought you a cube of margarine,"
he said, standing close to the door in an effort to speak through its thickness. "My name's J. R.
Isidore and I work for the well-known animal vet Mr. Hannibal Sloat; you've heard of him. I'm
reputable; I have a job. I drive Mr. Sloat's truck."
The door, meagerly, opened and he saw within the apartment a fragmented and misaligned
shrinking figure, a girl who cringed and slunk away and yet held onto the door, as if for physical
support. Fear made her seem ill; it distorted her body lines, made her appear as if someone had
broken her and then, with malice, patched her together badly. Her eyes, enormous, glazed over
fixedly as she attempted to smile.
He said, with sudden understanding, "You thought no one lived in this building. You thought it was
abandoned."
Nodding, the girl whispered, "Yes."
"But," Isidore said, "it's good to have neighbors. Heck, until you came along I didn't have any."
And that was no fun, god knew.
"You're the only one?" the girl asked. "In this building besides me?" She seemed less timid, now;
her body straightened and with her hand she smoothed her dark hair. Now he saw that she had a
nice figure, although small, and nice eyes markedly established by long black lashes. Caught by
surprise, the girl wore pajama bottoms and nothing more. And as he looked past her he perceived a
room in disorder. Suitcases lay here and there, opened, their contents half spilled onto the littered
floor. But this was natural; she had barely arrived.
"I'm the only one besides you," Isidore said. "And I won't bother you." He felt glum; his offering,
possessing the quality of an authentic old pre-war ritual, had not been accepted. In fact the girl did
even seem aware of it. Or maybe she did not understand what a cube of margarine was for. He had
that intuition; the girl seemed more bewildered than anything else. Out of her depth and helplessly
floating in now-receding circles of fear. "Good old Buster," he said, trying to reduce her rigid postural
stance. "You like him? I watch him every morning and then again at night when I get home; I watch
him while I'm eating dinner and then his late late show until I go to bed. At least until my TV set
broke."
"Who - " the girl began and then broke off; she bit her lip as if savagely angry. Evidently at herself.

30

"Buster Friendly," he explained. It seemed odd to him that this girl had never heard of Earth's most
knee-slapping TV comic. "Where did you come here from? " he asked curiously.
"I don't see that it matters." She shot a swift glance upward at him. Something that she saw
seemed to ease her concern; her body noticeably relaxed. "I'll be glad to receive company," she said,
"later on when I'm more moved in. Right now, of course, it's out of the question."
"Why out of the question?" He was puzzled; everything about her puzzled him. Maybe, he thought,
I've been living here alone too long. I've become strange. They say chickenheads are like that. The
thought made him feel even more glum. "I could help you unpack," he ventured; the door, now, had
virtually shut in his face. "And your furniture."
The girl said, "I have no furniture. All these things" - she indicated the room behind her - "they
were here."
"They won't do," Isidore said. He could tell that at a glance. The chairs, the carpet, the tables - all
had rotted away; they sagged in mutual ruin, victims of the despotic force of time. And of
abandonment. No one had lived in this apartment for years; the ruin had become almost complete.
He couldn't imagine how she figured on living in such surroundings. "Listen," he said earnestly. "If we
go all over the building looking we can probably find you things that aren't so tattered. A lamp from
one apartment, a table from another."
"I'll do it," the girl said. "Myself, thanks."
"You'd go into those apartments alone?" He could not believe it.
"Why not?" Again she shuddered nervously, grimacing in awareness of saying something wrong.
Isidore said, "I've tried it. Once. After that I just come home and go in my own place and I don't
think about the rest. The apartments in which no one lives - hundreds of them and all full of the
possessions people had, like family photographs and clothes. Those that died couldn't take anything
and those who emigrated didn't want to. This building, except for my apartment, is completely
kipple-ized."
"Kipple-ized'?" She did not comprehend.
"Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum
wrappers or yesterday's homeopape. When nobody's around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance,
if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning
there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more."
"I see." The girl regarded him uncertainly, not knowing whether to believe him. Not sure if he
meant it seriously.
"There's the First Law of Kipple," he said. "'Kipple drives out nonkipple.' Like Gresham's law
about bad money. And in these apartments there's been nobody there to fight the kipple."
"So it has taken over completely," the girl finished. She nodded. "Now I understand."
"Your place, here," he said, "this apartment you've picked - it's too kipple-ized to live in. We can
roll the kipple-factor back; we can do like I said, raid the other apts. But - " He broke off.
"But what?"
Isidore said, "We can't win."
"Why not? The girl stepped into the hall, closing the door behind her; arms folded self-consciously
before her small high breasts she faced him, eager to understand. Or so it appeared to him, anyhow.
She was at least listening.
"No one can win against kipple," he said, "except temporarily and maybe in one spot, like in my
apartment I've sort of created a stasis between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple, for the time
being. But eventually I'll die or go away, and then the kipple will again take over. It's a universal

31

principle operating throughout the universe; the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total,
absolute kippleization." He added, "Except of course for the upward climb of Wilbur Mercer."
The girl eyed him. "I don't see any relation."
"That's what Mercerism is all about." Again he found himself puzzled. "Don't you participate in
fusion? Don't you own an empathy box?"
After a pause the girl said carefully, "I didn't bring mine with me. I assumed I'd find one here."
"But an empathy box," he said, stammering in his excitement, "is the most personal possession you
have! It's an extension of your body; it's the way you touch other humans, it's the way you stop being
alone. But you know that. Everybody knows that. Mercer even lets people like me - " He broke off.
But too late; he had already told her and he could see by her face, by the flicker of sudden aversion,
that she knew. "I almost passed the IQ test," he said in a low, shaky voice. "I'm not very special,
only moderately; not like some you see. But that's what Mercer doesn't care about."
"As far as I'm concerned," the girl said, "you can count that as a major objection to Mercerism."
Her voice was clean and neutral; she intended only to state a fact, he realized. The fact of her attitude
toward chickenheads.
"I guess I'll go back upstairs," he said, and started away from her, his cube of margarine clutched;
it had become plastic and damp from the squeeze of his hand.
The girl watched him go, still with the neutral expression on her face. And then she called, "Wait."
Turning, he said, "Why?"
"I'll need you. For getting myself adequate furniture. From other apartments, as you said." She
strolled toward him, her bare upper body sleek and trim, without an excess gram of far. "What time
do you get home from work? You can help me then."
Isidore said, "Could you maybe fix dinner for us? If I brought home the ingredients?"
"No, I have too much to do." The girl shook off the request effortlessly and he noticed that,
perceived it without understanding it. Now that her initial fear had diminished, something else had
begun to emerge from her. Something more strange. And, he thought, deplorable. A coldness. Like,
he thought, a breath from the vacuum between inhabited worlds, in fact from nowhere: it was not
what she did or said but what she did not do and say. "Some other time," the girl said, and moved
back toward her apartment door.
"Did you get my name?" he said eagerly, "John Isidore, and I work for - "
"You told me who you work for." She had stopped briefly at her door; pushing it open she said,
"Some incredible person named Hannibal Sloat, who I'm sure doesn't exist outside your imagination.
My name is - " She gave him one last warmthless glance as she returned to her apartment, hesitated,
and said, "I'm Rachael Rosen.
"Of the Rosen Association?" he asked. "The system's largest manufacturer of humanoid robots
used in our colonization program?
A complicated expression instantly crossed her face, fleetingly, gone at once. "No," she said. "I
never heard of them; I don't know anything about it. More of your chickenbead imagination, I
suppose. John Isidore and his personal, private empathy box. Poor Mr. Isidore."
"But your name suggests - "
"My name," the girt said, "is Pris Stratton. That's my married name; I always use it. I never use any
other name but Pris. You can call me Pris." She reflected, then said, "No, you'd better address me as
Miss Stratton. Because we don't really know each other. At least I don't know you." The door shut
after her and he found himself alone in the dust-strewn dim hall.

32

SEVEN
Well, so it goes, J. R. Isidore thought as he stood clutching his soft cube of margarine. Maybe she'll
change her mind about letting me call her Pris. And possibly, if I can pick up a can of pre-war
vegetables, about dinner, too.
But maybe she doesn't know how to cook, he thought suddenly. Okay, I can do it; I'll fix dinner
for both of us. And I'll show her how so she can do it in the future if she wants. She'll probably want
to, once I show her how; as near as I can make out, most women, even young ones like her, like to
cook: it's an instinct.
Ascending the darkened stairs he returned to his own apartment.
She's really out of touch, he thought as he donned his white work uniform; even if he hurried he'd
be late to work and Mr. Sloat would be angry but so what? For instance, she's never beard of
Buster Friendly. And that's impossible; Buster is the most important human being alive, except of
course for Wilbur Mercer . . . but Mercer, he reflected, isn't a human being; he evidently is an
archetypal entity from the stars, superimposed on our culture by a cosmic template. At least that's
what I've heard people say; that's what Mr. Sloat says, for instance. And Hannibal Sloat would
know.
Odd that she isn't consistent about her own name, he pondered. She may need help. Can I give
her any help? he asked himself. A special, a chickenhead; what do I know? I can't marry and I can't
emigrate and the dust will eventually kill me. I have nothing to offer.
Dressed and ready to go he left his apartment, ascended to the roof where his battered used
hovercar lay parked.
An hour later, in the company track, he had picked up the first malfunctioning animal for the day.
An electric cat: it lay in the plastic dust-proof carrying cage in the rear of the truck and panted
erratically. You'd almost think it was real,
Isidore observed as he headed back to the Van Ness Pet Hospital - that carefully misnamed little
enterprise which barely existed in the tough, competitive field of false-animal repair.
The cat, in its travail, groaned.
Wow, Isidore said to himself. It really sounds as if it's dying. Maybe its ten-year battery has
shorted, and all its circuits are systematically burning out. A major job; Milt Borogrove, Van Ness
Pet Hospital's repairman, would have his bands full. And I didn't give the owner an estimate, Isidore
realized gloomily. The guy simply thrust the cat at me, said it had begun failing during the night, and
then I guess he took off for work. Anyhow all of a sudden the momentary verbal exchange had
ceased; the cat's owner had gone roaring up into the sky in his custom new-model handsome
hovercar. And the man constituted a new customer.
To the cat, Isidore said, "Can you hang on until we reach the shop?" The cat continued to wheeze.
"I'll recharge you while we're en route," Isidore decided; he dropped the truck toward the nearest
available roof and there, temporarily parked with the motor running, crawled into the back of the
truck and opened the plastic dust-proof carrying cage, which, in conjunction with his own white suit
and the name on the truck, created a total impression of a true animal vet picking up a true animal.
The electric mechanism, within its compellingly authentic style gray pelt, gurgled and blew bubbles,
its vid-lenses glassy, its metal jaws locked together. This had always amazed him, these "disease"
circuits built into false animals; the construct which he now held on his lap had been put together in
such a fashion that when a primary component misfired, the whole thing appeared - not broken - but
organically ill. It would have fooled me, Isidore said to himself as he groped within the ersatz

33

stomach fur for the concealed control panel (quite small on this variety of false animal) plus the
quick-charge battery terminals, He could find neither. Nor could he search very long; the mechanism
had almost failed. If it does consist of a short, he reflected, which is busy burning out circuits, then
maybe I should try to detach one of the battery cables; the mechanism will shut down, but no more
harm will be done. And then, in the shop, Milt can charge it back up.
Deftly, he ran his fingers along the pseudo bony spine. The cables should be about here. Damn
expert workmanship; so absolutely perfect an imitation. Cables not apparent even under close
scrutiny. Must be a Wheelright & Carpenter product - they cost more, but look what good work
they do.
He gave up; the false cat had ceased functioning, so evidently the short - if that was what ailed the
thing - had finished off the power supply and basic drive-train. That'll run into money, he thought
pessimistically. Well, the guy evidently hadn't been getting the three-times-yearly preventive cleaning
and lubricating, which made all the difference. Maybe this would teach the owner - the hard way.
Crawling back in the driver's seat he put the wheel into climb position, buzzed up into the air once
I more, and resumed his flight back to the repair shop.
Anyhow he no longer had to listen to the nerve-wracking wheezing of the construct; he could
relax. Funny, he thought; even though I know rationally it's faked the sound of a false animal burning
out its drive-train and power supply ties my stomach in knots. I wish, he thought painfully, that I
could get another job. If I hadn't failed that IQ test I wouldn't be reduced to this ignominious task
with its attendant emotional by-products. On the other hand, the synthetic sufferings of false animals
didn't bother Milt Borogrove or their boss Hannibal Sloat. So maybe it's I, John Isidore said to
himself. Maybe when you deteriorate back down the ladder of evolution - as I have, when you sink
into the tomb world slough of being a special- well, best to abandon that line of inquiry. Nothing
depressed him more than the moments in which he contrasted his current mental powers with what
he had formerly possessed. Every day he declined in sagacity and vigor. He and the thousands of
other specials throughout Terra, all of them moving toward the ash heap. Turning into living Ripple.
For company he clicked on the truck's radio and tuned for Buster Friendly's aud show, which,
Eke the TV version, continued twenty-three unbroken warm hours a day . . . the additional one hour
being a religious sign-off, ten minutes of silence, and then a religious sign-on.
" - glad to have you on the show again," Buster Friendly was saying. "Let's see, Amanda; it's been
two whole days since we've visited with you. Starting on any new pics, dear?"
"Veil, I vuz goink to do a pic yestooday baht vell, dey vanted me to staht ad seven - "
"Seven A.M.?" Buster Friendly broke in.
"Yess, dot's right, Booster; it vuz seven hey hem!" Amanda Werner laughed her famous laugh,
nearly as imitated as Buster's. Amanda Werner and several other beautiful, elegant, conically
breasted foreign ladies, from unspecified vaguely defined countries, plus a few bucolic so-called
humorists, comprised Buster's perpetual core of repeats. Women like Amanda Werner never made
movies, never appeared in plays; they lived out their queer, beautiful lives as guests on Buster's
unending show, appearing, Isidore had once calculated, as much as seventy hours a week.
How did Buster Friendly find the time to tape both his aud and vid shows? Isidore wondered.
And how did Amanda Werner find time to be a guest every other day, month after month, year after
year? How did they keep talking? They never repeated themselves - not so far as he could
determine. Their remarks, always witty, always new, weren't rehearsed. Amanda's hair glowed, her
eyes glinted, her teeth shone; she never ran down, never became tired, never found herself at a loss
as to a clever retort to Buster's bang-bang string of quips, jokes, and sharp observations. The Buster
Friendly Show, telecast and broadcast over all Earth via satellite, also poured down on the emigrants

34

of the colony planets. Practice transmissions beamed to Proxima had been attempted, in case human
colonization extended that far. Had the Salander 3 reached its destination the travelers aboard would
have found the Buster Friendly Show awaiting them. And they would have been glad.
But something about Buster Friendly irritated John Isidore, one specific thing. In subtle, almost
inconspicuous ways, Buster ridiculed the empathy boxes. Not once but many times. He was, in fact,
doing it right now.
" - no rock nicks on me," Buster prattled away to Amanda Werner. "And if I'm going up the side
of a mountain I want a couple of bottles of Budweiser beer along!" The studio audience laughed, and
Isidore heard a sprinkling of handclaps. "And I'll reveal my carefully documented exposé from up
there - that exposé coming exactly ten hours from now!"
"Ent me, too, dahiink! " Amanda gushed. "Tek me wit you! I go alonk en ven dey trow a rock et
us I protek you! " Again the audience howled, and John Isidore felt baffled and impotent rage seep
up into the back of his neck. Why did Buster Friendly always chip away at Mercerism? No one else
seemed bothered by it; even the U.N. approved. And the American and Soviet police had publicly
stated that Mercerism reduced crime by making citizens more concerned about the plight of their
neighbors. Mankind needs more empathy, Titus Corning, the U. N. Secretary General, had declared
several times. Maybe Buster is jealous, Isidore conjectured. Sure, that would explain it; he and
Wilbur Mercer are in competition. But for what?
Our minds, Isidore decided. They're fighting for control of our psychic selves; the empathy box on
one hand, Buster's guffaws and off-the-cuff jibes on the other. I'll have to tell Hannibal Sloat that, he
decided. Ask him if it's true; he'll know.
When he had parked his truck on the roof of the Van Ness Pet Hospital he quickly carried the
plastic cage containing the inert false cat downstairs to Hannibal Sloat's office. As he entered, Mr.
Sloat glanced up from a parts-inventory page, his gray, seamed face rippling like troubled water.
Too old to emigrate, Hannibal Sloat, although not a special, was doomed to creep out his remaining
life on Earth. The dust, over the years, had eroded him; it had left his features gray, his thoughts gray;
it had shrunk him and made his legs spindly and his gait unsteady. He saw the world through glasses
literally dense with dust. For some reason Sloat never cleaned his glasses. It was as if he had given
up; he had accepted the radioactive dirt and it had begun its job, long ago, of burying him. Already it
obscured his sight. In the few years he had remaining it would corrupt his other senses until at last
only his bird-screech voice would remain, and then that would expire, too.
"What do you have there?" Mr. Sloat asked.
"A cat with a short in its power supply." Isidore set the cage down on the document-littered desk
of his boss.
"Why show it to me?" Sloat demanded. "Take it down in the shop to Milt." However, reflexively,
he opened the cage and tugged the false animal out. Once, he had been a repairman. A very good
one.
Isidore said, "I think Buster Friendly and Mercerism are fighting for control of our psychic souls."
"If so," Sloat said, examining the cat, "Buster is winning."
"He's winning now," Isidore said, "but ultimately he'll lose."
Sloat lifted his bead, peered at him. "Why?"
"Because Wilbur Mercer is always renewed. He's eternal. At the top of the hill he's struck down;
he sinks into the tomb world but then he rises inevitably. And us with him. So we're eternal, too." He
felt good, speaking so well; usually around Mr. Sloat he stammered.
Sloat said, "Buster is immortal, like Mercer. There's no difference."

35

"How can he he? He's a man."
"I don't know," Sloat said. "But it's true. They've never admitted it, of course."
"Is that how come Buster Friendly can do forty-six hours of show a day?"
"That's right," Sloat said.
"What about Amanda Werner and those other women?"
"They're immortal, too."
"Are they a superior life form from another system?"
"I've never been able to determine that for sure," Mr. Sloat said, still examining the cat. He now
removed his dust-filmed glasses, peered without them at the half-open mouth. "As I have
conclusively in the case of Wilbur Mercer," he finished almost inaudibly. He cursed, then, a string of
abuse lasting what seemed to Isidore a full minute. "This cat," Sloat said finally, "isn't false. I knew
sometime this would happen. And it's dead." He stared down at the corpse of the cat. And cursed
again.
Wearing his grimy blue sailcloth apron, burly pebble-skinned Milt Borogrove appeared at the
office door. "What's the matter?" he said. Seeing the cat he entered the office and picked up the
animal.
"The chickenhead," Sloat said, "brought it in." Never before had he used that term in front of
Isidore.
"If it was still alive," Milt said, "we could take it to a real animal vet. I wonder what it's worth.
Anybody got a copy of Sidney's? "
"D-doesn't y-y-your insurance c-c-cover this?" Isidore asked Mr. Sloat. Under him his legs
wavered and he felt the room begin to turn dark maroon cast over with specks of green.
"Yes," Sloat said finally, half snarling. "But it's the waste that gets me. The loss of one more living
creature. Couldn't you tell, Isidore? Didn't you notice the difference?"
"I thought," Isidore managed to say, "it was a really good job. So good it fooled me; I mean, it
seemed alive and a job that good - "
"I don't think Isidore can tell the difference," Milt said mildly. "To him they're all alive, false animals
included. He probably tried to save it." To Isidore he said, "What did you do, try to recharge its
battery? Or locate a short in it?
"Y - yes," Isidore admitted.
"It probably was so far gone it wouldn't have made it anyhow," Milt said. "Let the chickenhead off
the hook, Han. He's got a point; the fakes are beginning to be darn near real, what with those
disease circuits they're building into the new ones. And living animals do die; that's one of the risks in
owning them. We're just not used to it because all we see are fakes."
"The goddamn waste," Sloat said.
"According to M-mercer," Isidore pointed Out, "a-all life returns. The cycle is c-c-complete for aa-animals, too. I mean, we all ascend with him, die - "
"Tell that to the guy that owned this cat," Mr. Sloat said.
Not sure if his boss was serious Isidore said, "You mean I have to? But you always handle
vidcalls." He had a phobia about the vidphone and found making a call, especially to a stranger,
virtually impossible. Mr. Sloat, of course, knew this.
"Don't make him," Milt said. "I'll do it." He reached for the receiver. "What's his number?"
"I've got it here somewhere." Isidore fumbled in his work smock pockets.
Sloat said, "I want the chickenhead to do it."

36

"I c-c-can't use the vidphone," Isidore protested, his heart laboring. "Because I'm hairy, ugly,
dirty, stooped, snaggletoothed, and gray. And also I feel sick from the radiation; I think I'm going to
die."
Milt smiled and said to Sloat, "I guess if I felt that way I wouldn't use the vidphone either. Come
on, Isidore; if you don't give me the owner's number I can't make the call and you'll have to." He held
out his hand amiably.
"The chickenhead makes it," Sloat said, "or he's fired." He did not look either at Isidore or at Milt;
he glared fixedly forward.
"Aw come on," Milt protested.
Isidore said, "I d-d-don't like to be c-c-called a chickenhead. I mean, the d-d-dust has d-d-done
a lot to you, too, physically. Although maybe n-n-not your brain, as in m-my case." I'm fired, he
realized. I can't make the call. And then all at once he remembered that the owner of the cat had
zipped off to work. There would be no one home. "I g-guess I can call him," he said, as he fished out
the tag with the information on it.
"See? " Mr. Sloat said to Milt. "He can do it if he has to."
Seated at the vidphone, receiver in hand, Isidore dialed.
"Yeah," Milt said, "but he shouldn't have to. And he's right; the dust has affected you; you're damn
near blind and in a couple of years you won't be able to hear."
Sloat said, "It's got to you, too, Borogrove. Your skin is the color of dog manure."
On the vidscreen a face appeared, a mitteleuropaische some-what careful-looking woman who
wore her hair in a tight bun. "Yes?" she said.
"M-m-mrs. Pilsen?" Isidore said, terror spewing through him; he had not thought of it naturally but
the owner had a wife, who of course was home. "I want to t-t-talk to you about your c-c-c-c-c-c - "
He broke off, rubbed his chin tic-wise. "Your cat."
"Oh yes, you picked up Horace," Mrs. Pilsen said. "Did it turn out to be pneumonitis? That's what
Mr. Pilsen thought."
Isidore said, "Your cat died."
"Oh no god in heaven."
"We'll replace it," he said. "We have insurance." He glanced toward Mr. Sloat; he seemed to
concur. "The owner of our firm, Mr. Hannibal Sloat - " He floundered. "Will personally - "
"No," Sloat said, "we'll give them a check. Sidney's list price."
" - will personally pick the replacement cat out for you," Isidore found himself saying. Having
started a conversation which he could not endure he discovered himself unable to get back out.
What he was saying possessed an intrinsic logic which he had no means of halting; it had to grind to
its own conclusion. Both Mr. Sloat and Milt Borogrove stared at him as he rattled on, "Give us the
specifications of the cat you desire. Color, sex, subtype, such as Manx, Persian, Abyssinian - "
"Horace is dead," Mrs. Pilsen said.
"He had pneumonitis," Isidore said. "He died on the trip to the hospital. Our senior staff physician,
Dr. Hannibal Sloat, expressed the belief that nothing at this point could have saved him. But isn't it
fortunate, Mrs. Pilsen, that we're going to replace him. Am I correct?"
Mrs. Pilsen, tears appearing in her eyes, said, "There is only one cat like Horace. He used to when he was just a kitten - stand and stare up at us as if asking a question. We never understood
what the question was. Maybe now he knows the answer." Fresh tears appeared. "I guess we all will
eventually."

37

An inspiration came to Isidore. "What about an exact electric duplicate of your cat? We can have
a superb handcrafted job by Wheelright & Carpenter in which every detail of the old animal is
faithfully repeated in permanent - "
"Oh that's dreadful!" Mrs. Pilsen protested. "What are you saying? Don't tell my husband that;
don't suggest that to Ed or he'll go mad. He loved Horace more than any cat he ever had, and he's
had a cat since he was a child."
Taking the vidphone receiver from Isidore, Milt said to the woman, "We can give you a check in
the amount of Sidney's list, or as Mr. Isidore suggested we can pick out a new cat for you. We're
very sorry that your cat died, but as Mr. Isidore pointed out, the cat had pneumonitis, which is
almost always fatal." His tone rolled out professionally; of the three of them at the Van Ness Pet
Hospital, Milt performed the best in the matter of business phone calls.
"I can't tell my husband," Mrs. Pilsen said.
"All right, ma'am," Milt said, and grimaced slightly. "We'll call him. Would you give me his number
at his place of employment?" He groped for a pen and pad of paper; Mr. Sloat handed them to him.
"Listen," Mrs. Pilsen said; she seemed now to rally. "Maybe the other gentleman is right. Maybe I
ought to commission an electric replacement of Horace but without Ed ever knowing; could it be so
faithful a reproduction that my husband wouldn't be able to tell?"
Dubiously, Milt said, "If that's what you want. But it's been our experience that the owner of the
animal is never fooled. It's only casual observers such as neighbors. You see, once you get real close
to a false animal - "
"Ed never got physically close to Horace, even though he loved him; I was the one who took care
of all Horace's personal needs such as his sandbox. I think I would like to try a false animal, and if it
didn't work then you could find us a real cat to replace Horace. I just don't want my husband to
know; I don't think he could live through it. That's why he never got close to Horace; he was afraid
to. And when Horace got sick - with pneumonitis, as you tell me - Ed got panic-stricken and just
wouldn't face it. That's why we waited so long to call you. Too long . . . as I knew before you called.
I knew." She nodded, her tears under control, now. "How long will it take?"
Milt essayed, "We can have it ready in ten days. "We'll deliver it during the day while your
husband is at work." He wound up the call, said good-by, and hung up. "He'll know," he said to Mr.
Sloat. "In five seconds. But that's what she wants."
"Owners who get to love their animals," Sloat said somberly, "go to pieces. I'm glad we're not
usually involved with real animals. You realize that actual animal vets have to make calls like that all
the time?" He contemplated John Isidore. "In some ways you're not so stupid after all, Isidore. You
handled that reasonably well. Even though Milt had to come in and take over."
"He was doing fine," Milt said. "God, that was tough." He picked up the dead Horace. "I'll take
this down to the shop; Han, you phone Wheelright & Carpenter and get their builder over to
measure and photograph it. I'm not going to let them take it to their shop; I want to compare the
replica myself."
"I think I'll have Isidore talk to them," Mr. Sloat decided. "He got this started; he ought to be able
to deal with Wheelright & Carpenter after handling Mrs. Pilsen."
Milt said to Isidore, "Just don't let them take the original." He held up Horace. "They'll want to
because it makes their work a hell of a lot easier. Be firm."
"Um," Isidore said, blinking. "Okay. Maybe I ought to call them now before it starts to decay.
Don't dead bodies decay or something?" He felt elated.

After parking the departments speedy beefed-up hovercar on the roof of the San Francisco Hall of
Justice on Lombard Street, bounty hunter Rick Deckard, briefcase in hand, descended to Harry
Bryant's office.
"You're back awfully soon," his superior said, leaning back in his chair and taking a pinch of
Specific No. 1 snuff.
"I got what you sent me for." Rick seated himself facing the desk. He set his briefcase down. I'm
tired, he realized. It had begun to hit him, now that he had gotten back; he wondered if he would be
able to recoup enough for the job ahead. "How's Dave?" he asked. "Well enough for me to go talk
to him? I want to before I tackle the first of the andys."
Bryant said, "You'll be trying for Polokov first. The one that lasered Dave. Best to get him right
out of it, since he knows we've got him listed."
"Before I talk to Dave?"
Bryant reached for a sheet of onionskin paper, a blurred third or fourth carbon. "Polokov has
taken a job with the city as a trash collector, a scavenger."
"Don't only specials do that kind of work?"
"Polokov is mimicking a special, an anthead. Very deteriorated - or so he pretends to be. That's
what suckered Dave; Polokov apparently looks and acts so much like an anthead that Dave forgot.
Are you sure about the Voigt-Kampff scale now? You're absolutely certain, from what happened up
in Seattle, that - "
"I am," Rick said shortly. He did not amplify.
Bryant said, "I'll take your word for it. But there can't be even one slip-up."
"There never could be in andy hunting. This is no different."
"The Nexus-6 is different."
"I already found my first one," Rick 'said. "And Dave found two. Three, if you count Polokov.
Okay, I'll retire Polokov today, and then maybe tonight or tomorrow talk to Dave." He reached for
the blurred carbon, the poop sheet on the android Polokov.
"One more item," Bryant said. "A Soviet cop, from the W.P.O., is on his way here. While you
were in Seattle I got a call from him; he's aboard an Aeroflot rocket that'll touch down at the public
field, here, in about an hour. Sandor Kadalyi, his name is."
"What's he want?" Rarely if ever did W.P.O. cops show up in San Francisco.
"W.P.O. is enough interested in the new Nexus-6 types that they want a man of theirs to be with
you. An observer and also, if he can, he'll assist you. It's for you to decide when and if he can be of
value. But I've already given him permission to tag along."
"What about the bounty?" Rick said.
"You won't have to split it," Bryant said, and smiled creakily.
"I just wouldn't regard it as financially fair." He had absolutely no intention of sharing his winnings
with a thug from W.P.O. He studied the poop sheet on Polokov; it gave a description of the man or rather the andy - and his current address and place of business: The Bay Area Scavengers
Company with offices on Geary.
"Want to wait on the Polokov retirement until the Soviet cop gets here to help you?" Bryant
asked.
Rick bristled. "I've always worked alone. Of course, it's your decision - I'll do whatever you say.
But I'd just as soon tackle Polokov right now, without waiting for Kadalyi to hit town."

39

"You go ahead on your own," Bryant decided. "And then on the next one, which'll be a Miss Luba
Luft - you have the sheet there on her, too - you can bring in Kadalyi."
Having stuffed the onionskin carbons in his briefcase, Rick left his superior's office and ascended
once more to the roof and his parked hovercar. And now let's visit Mr. Polokov, he said to himself.
He patted his laser tube.
For his first try at the android Polokov, Rick stopped off at the offices of the Bay Area
Scavengers Company.
"I'm looking for an employee of yours," he said to the severe, gray-haired switchboard woman.
The scavengers' building impressed him; large and modern, it held a good number of high-cllass
purely office employees. The deep-pile carpets, the expensive genuine wood desks, reminded him
that garbage collecting and trash disposal had, since the war, become one of Earth's important
industries. The entire planet had begun to disintegrate into junk, and to keep the planet habitable for
the remaining population the junk had to be hauled away occasionally . . . or, as Buster Friendly
liked to declare, Earth would die under a layer - not of radioactive dust - but of kipple.
"Mr. Ackers," the switchboard woman informed him. "He's the personnel manager." She pointed
to an impressive but imitation oak desk at which sat a prissy, tiny, bespectacled individual, merged
with his plethora of paperwork.
Rick presented his police ID. "Where's your employee Polokov right now? At his job or at
home?"
After reluctantly consulting his records Mr. Ackers said, "Polokov ought to be at work. Flattening
hovercars at our Daly City plant and dumping them into the Bay. However - " The personnel
manager consulted a further document, then picked up his vidphone and made an inside call to
someone else in the building. "He's not, then," he said, terminating the call; hanging up he said to
Rick, "Polokov didn't show up for work today. No explanation. What's he done, officer? "
"If he should show up," Rick said, "don't tell him I here asking about him. You understand?"
"Yes, I understand," Ackers said sulkily, as if his deep schooling in police matters had been
derided.
In the department's beefed-up hovercar Rick next flew to Polokov's apartment building in the
Tenderloin. We'll never get him, he told himself. They - Bryant and Holden - waited too long.
Instead of sending me to Seattle, Bryant should have sicced me on Polokov - better still last night, as
soon as Dave Holden got his.
What a grimy place, he observed as he walked across the roof to the elevator. Abandoned animal
pens, encrusted with months of dust. And, in one cage, a no longer functioning false animal, a
chicken. By elevator he descended to Polokov's floor, found the hall limit, like a subterranean cave.
Using his police A-powered sealed-beam light he illuminated the hall and once again glanced over
the onionskin carbon. The Voigt-Kampff test had been administered to Polokov; that part could be
bypassed, and he could go directly to the task of destroying the android.
Best to get him from out here, he decided. Setting down his weapons kit he fumbled it open, got
out a nondirectional Penfield wave transmitter; he punched the key for catalepsy, himself protected
against the mood emanation by means of a counterwave broadcast through the transmitter's metal
hull directed to him alone.
They're now all frozen stiff, he said to himself as he shut off the transmitter. Everyone, human and
andy alike, in the vicinity. No risk to me; all I have to do is walk in and laser him. Assuming, of
course, that he's in his apartment, which isn't likely.

40

Using an infinity key, which anayzed and opened all forms of locks known, he entered Polokov's
apartment, laser beam in hand.
No Polokov. Only semi-ruined furniture, a place of kipple and decay. In fact no personal articles:
what greeted him consisted of unclaimed debris which Polokov had inherited when he took the
apartment and which in leaving he had abandoned to the next - if any - tenant.
I knew it, he said to himself. Well, there goes the first thousand dollars bounty; probably skipped
all the way to the Antarctic Circle. Out of my jurisdiction; another bounty hunter from another police
department will retire Polokov and claim the money. On, I suppose, to the andys who haven't been
warned, as was Polokov. On to Luba Luft.
Back again on the roof in his hovercar he reported by phone to Harry Bryant. "No luck on
Polokov. Left probably right after he lasered Dave." He inspected his wristwatch. "Want me to pick
up Kadalyi at the field? It'll save time and I'm eager to get started on Miss Luft." He already had the
poop sheet on her laid out before him, had begun a thorough study of it.
"Good idea," Bryant said, "except that Mr. Kadalyi is already here; his Aeroflot ship - as usual, he
says - arrived early. Just a moment." An invisible conference. "He'll fly over and meet you where you
are now," Bryant said, returning to the screen. "Meanwhile read up on Miss Luft."
"An opera singer. Allegedly from Germany. At present attached to the San Francisco Opera
Company." He nodded in reflexive agreement, mind on the poop sheet. "Must have a good voice to
make connections so fast. Okay, I'll wait here for Kadalyi." He gave Bryant his location and rang off.
I'll pose as an opera fan, Rick decided as he read further. I particularly would like to see her as
Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. In my personal collection I have tapes by such oldtime greats as
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Lotte Lehmann and Lisa Della Casa; that'll give us something to discuss
while I set up my Voigt-Kampff equipment.
His car phone buzzed. He picked up the receiver.
The police operator said, "Mr. Deckard, a call for Von from Seattle; Mr. Bryant said to put it
through to you. From the Rosen Association."
"Okay," Rick said, and waited. What do they want? he wondered. As far as he could discern, the
Rosens had already proven to be bad news. And undoubtedly would continue so, whatever they
intended.
Rachel Rosen's face appeared on the tiny screen. "Hello, Officer Deckard." Her tone seemed
placating; that caught his attention. "Are you busy right now or can I talk to you?"
"Go ahead," he said.
"We of the association have been discussing your situation regarding the escaped Nexus-6 types
and knowing them as we do we feel that you'll have better luck if one of us works in conjunction with
you."
"By doing what?"
"Well, by one of us coming along with you. When you go out looking for them."
"Why? What would you add?"
Rachael said, "The Nexus-6s would be wiry at being approached by a human. But if another
Nexus-6 made the contact - "
You specifically mean yourself."
"Yes." She nodded, her face sober.
"I've got too much help already."
"But I really think you need me."

41

"I doubt it. I'll think it over and call you back." At some distant, unspecified future time, he said to
himself. Or more likely never. That's all I need: Rachael Rosen popping up through the dust at every
step.
"You don't really mean it," Rachael said. "You'll never call me. You don't realize how agile an
illegal escaped Nexus-6 is, how impossible it'll be for you. We feel we owe you this because of you know. What we did."
"I'll take it under advisement." He started to hang up.
"Without me," Rachael said, "one of them will get you before you can get it."
"Good-by," he said and hung up. What kind of world is it, he asked himself, when an android
phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance? He rang the police operator back. "Don't put
any more calls through to me from Seattle," he said.
"Yes, Mr. Deckard. Has Mr. Kadalyi reached you, yet?"
"I'm still waiting. And he had better hurry because I'm not going to be here long." Again he hung
up.
As he resumed reading the poop sheet on Luba Luft a hovercar taxi spun down to land on the
roof a few yards off. From it a red-faced, cherubic-looking man, evidently in his mid-fifties, wearing
a heavy and impressive Russian-style greatcoat, stepped and, smiling, his hand extended,
approached Rick's car.
"Mr. Deckard?" the man asked with a Slavic accent. "The bounty hunter for the San Francisco
Police Department?" The empty taxi rose, and the Russian watched it go, absently. "I'm Sandor
Kadalyi," the man said, and opened the car door to squeeze in beside Rick.
As he shook hands with Kadalyi, Rick noticed that the W.P.O. representative carried an unusual
type of laser tube, a subform which he had never seen before.
"Oh, this?" Kadalyi said. "Interesting, isn't it?" He tugged it from his belt holster. "I got this on
Mars."
"I thought I knew every handgun made," Rick said. "Even those manufactured at and for use in the
colonies."
"We made this ourselves," Kadalyi said, beaming like a Slavic Santa, his ruddy face inscribed with
pride. "You like it? What is different about it, functionally, is - here, take it." He passed the gun over
to Rick, who inspected it expertly, by way of years of experience.
"How does it differ functionally?" Rick asked. He couldn't tell.
"Press the trigger."
Aiming upward, out the window of the car, Rick squeezed the trigger of the weapon. Nothing
happened; no beam emerged. Puzzled, he turned to Kadalyi.
"The triggering circuit," Kadalyi said cheerfully, "isn't attached. It remains with me. You see?" He
opened his hand, revealed a tiny unit. "And I can also direct it, within certain limits. Irrespective of
where it's aimed."
"You're not Polokov, you're Kadalyi," Rick said.
"Don't you mean that the other way around? You're a bit confused."
"I mean you're Polokov, the android; you're not from the Soviet police." Rick, with his toe,
pressed the emergency button on the floor of his car.
"Why won't my laser tube fire?" Kadalyi-Polokov said, switching on and off the miniaturized
triggering and aiming device which he held in the palm of his hand.
"A sine wave," Rick said. "That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary
light."

42

"Then I'll have to break your pencil neck." The android dropped the device and, with a snarl,
grabbed with both hands for Rick's throat.
As the android's hands sank into his throat Rick fired his regulation issue old-style pistol from its
shoulder holster; the .38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst. The
Nexus-6 unit which operated it blew into pieces, a raging, mad wind which carried throughout the
car. Bits of it, like the radioactive dust itself, whirled down on Rick. The retired remains of the
android rocked back, collided with the car door, bounced off and struck heavily against him; he
found himself struggling to shove the twitching remnants of the android away.
Shakily, he at last reached for the car phone, called in to the Hall of Justice. "Shall I make my
report?" he said. "Tell Harry Bryant that I got Polokov."
"'You got Polokov.' He'll understand that, will he?"
"Yes," Rick said, and hung up. Christ that came close, he said to himself. I must have overreacted
to Rachael Rosen's warning; I went the other way and it almost finished me. But I got Polokov, he
said to himself. His adrenal gland, by degrees, ceased pumping its several secretions into his
bloodstream; his heart slowed to normal, his breathing became less frantic. But he still shook.
Anyhow I made myself a thousand dollars just now, he informed himself. So it was worth it. And I'm
faster to react than Dave Holden. Of course, however, Dave's experience evidently prepared me;
that has to be admitted. Dave had not had such warning.
Again picking up the phone he placed a call home to his apt, to Iran. Meanwhile he managed to
light a cigarette; the shaking had begun to depart.
His wife's face, sodden with the six-hour self-accusatory depression which she had prophesied,
manifested itself on the vidscreen. "Oh hello, Rick."
"What happened to the 594 I dialed for you before I left? Pleased acknowledgment of - "
"I redialed. As soon as you left. What do you want?" Her voice sank into a dreary drone of
despond. "I'm so tired and I just have no hope left, of anything. Of our marriage - and you possibly
getting killed by one of those andys. Is that what you want to tell me, Rick? That an andy got you?"
In the background the racket of Buster Friendly boomed and brayed, eradicating her words; he saw
her mouth moving but heard only the TV.
"Listen," he broke in. "Can you hear me? I'm on to something. A new type of android that
apparently nobody can handle but me. I've retired one already, so that's a grand to start with. You
know what we're going to have before I'm through?"
Iran stared at him sightlessly. "Oh," she said, nodding.
"I haven't said yet!" He could tell, now; her depression this time had become too vast for her even
to hear him. For all intents he spoke into a vacuum. "I'll see you tonight," he finished bitterly and
slammed the receiver down. Damn her, he said to himself. What good does it do, my risking my life?
She doesn't care whether we own an ostrich or not; nothing penetrates. I wish I had gotten rid of her
two years ago when we were considering splitting up. I can still do it, he reminded himself.
Broodingly, he leaned down, gathered together on the car floor his crumpled papers, including the
info on Luba Luft. No support, he informed himself. Most androids I've known have more vitality
and desire to live than my wife. She has nothing to give me.
That made him think of Rachael Rosen again. Her advice to me as to the Nexus-6 mentality, he
realized, turned out to be correct. Assuming she doesn't want any of the bounty money, maybe I
could use her.
The encounter with Kadalyi-Polokov had changed his ideas rather massively.

43

Snapping on his hovercar's engine he whisked nippity-nip up into the sky, heading toward the old
War Memorial Opera House, where, according to Dive Holden's notes, he would find Luba Luft this
time of the day.
He wondered, now, about her, too. Some female androids seemed to him pretty; he had found
himself physically attracted by several, and it was an odd sensation, knowing intellectually that they
were machines but emotionally reacting anyhow.
For example Rachael Rosen. No, he decided; she's too thin. No real development, especially in
the bust. A figure like a child's, flat and tame. He could do better. How old did the poop sheet say
Luba Luft was? As he drove he hauled out the now wrinkled notes, found her so-called "age."
Twenty-eight, the sheet read. Judged by appearance, which, with andys, was the only useful
standard.
It's a good thing I know something about opera, Rick reflected. That's another advantage I have
over Dave; I'm more culturally oriented.
I'll try one more andy before I ask Rachael for help, he decided. If Miss Luft proves exceptionally
hard-but he had an intuition she wouldn't. Polokov had been the rough one; the others, unaware that
anyone actively hunted them, would crumble in succession, plugged like a file of ducks.
As he descended toward the ornate, expansive roof of the opera house he loudly sang a potpourri
of arias, with pseudo-Italian words made up on the spot by himself; even without the Penfield mood
organ at hand his spirits brightened into optimism. And into hungry, gleeful anticipation.

44

NINE
In the enormous whale-belly of steel and stone carved out to form the long-enduring old opera house
Rick Deckard found an echoing, noisy, slightly miscontrived rehearsal taking place. As he entered he
recognized the music: Mozart's The Magic Flute, the first act in its final scenes. The moor's slaves - in
other words the chorus - had taken up their song a bar too soon and this had nullified the simple
rhythm of the magic bells.
What a pleasure; he loved The Magic Flute. He seated himself in a dress circle scat (no one
appeared to notice him) and made himself comfortable. Now Popageno in his fantastic pelt of bird
feathers had joined Pamina to sing words which always brought tears to Rick's eyes, when and if he
happened to think about it.
Könnte jedar brave Mann
solche Glöckchen finden,
eine Feinde würden dann
ohne Muhe schwinden.
Well, Rick thought, in real life no such magic bells exist that make your enemy effortlessly
disappear. Too bad. And Mozart, not long after writing The Magic Flute, had died in his thirties - of
kidney disease. And had been buried in an unmarked paupers' grave.
Thinking this he wondered if Mozart had had any intuition that the future did not exist, that he had
already used up his little time. Maybe I have, too, Rick thought as he watched the rehearsal move
along. This rehearsal will end, the performance will end, the singers will die, eventually the last score
of the music will be destroyed in one way or another; finally the name "Mozart" will vanish, the dust
will have won. If not on this planet then another. We can evade it awhile. As the andys can evade me
and exist a finite stretch longer. But I get them or some other bounty hunter gets them. In a way, he
realized, I'm part of the form-destroying process of entropy. The Rosen Association creates and I
unmake. Or anyhow so it must seem to them.
On the stage Papageno and Pamina engaged in a dialogue. He stopped his introspection to listen.
Papageno:
"My child, what should we now say.
Pamina: " - the truth. That's what we will say."
Leaning forward and peering, Rick studied Pamina in her heavy, convoluted robes, with her
wimple trailing its veil about her shoulders and face. He reexamined the poop sheet, then leaned
back, satisfied. I've now seen my third Nexus-6 android, he realized. This is Luba Luft. A little
ironic, tile sentiment her role calls for. However vital, active, and nice-looking, an escaped android
could hardly tell the truth; about itself, anyhow.
On tile stage Luba Luft sang, and he found himself surprised at the quality of her voice; it rated
with that of the best, even that of notables in his collection of historic tapes. The Rosen Associaion
built her well, he had to admit. And again he perceived himself sub specie aeternitatis, the
formdestroyer called forth by what he heard and saw here. Perhaps the better she functions, the
better a singer she is, the more I am needed. If the androids had remained substandard, like the
ancient q-40s made by Derain Associates - there would be no problem and no need of my skill. I
wonder when I should do it, he asked himself. As soon as possible, probably. At the end of the
rehearsal when she goes to her dressing room.

45

At the end of the act the rehearsal ended temporarily. It would resume, the conductor said in
English, French, and German, in an hour and a half. The conductor then departed; the musicians left
their instruments and also left. Getting to his feet Rick made his way backstage to the dressing
rooms; he followed the tail end of the cast, taking his time and thinking, It's better this way, getting it
immediately over with. I'll spend as short a time talking to her and testing her as possible. As soon as
I'm sure - but technically he could not be sure until after the test. Maybe Dave guessed wrong on
her, he conjectured. I hope so. But he doubted it. Already, instinctively, his professional sense had
responded. And he had yet to err . . . throughout years with the department.
Stopping a super he asked for Miss Luft's dressing room; the super, wearing makeup and the
costume of an Egyptian spear carrier, pointed. Rick arrived at the indicated door, saw an ink-written
note tacked to it reading MISS LUFT PRIVATE, and knocked.
"Come in."
He entered. The girl sat at her dressing table, a much-handled clothbound score open on her
knees, marking here and there with a ball-point pen. She still wore her costume and makeup, except
for the wimple; that she had set. down on its rack. "Yes?" she said, looking up. The stage makeup
enlarged her eyes,, enormous and hazel they fixed on him and did not waver. "I am busy, as you can
see." Her English contained no remnant of an accent.
Rick said, "You compare favorably to Schwarzkopf."
"Who are you?" Her tone held cold reserve - and that other cold, which he had encountered in so
many androids. Always the same: great intellect, ability to accomplish much, but also this. He
deplored it. And yet, without it, he could not track them down.
"I'm from the San Francisco Police Department," he said.
"Oh?" The huge and intense eyes did not flicker, did not respond. "What are you here about?" Her
tone, oddly, seemed gracious.
Seating himself in a nearby chair he unzipped his briefcase. "I have been sent here to administer a
standard personality-profile test to you. It won't take more than a few minutes."
"Is it necessary?" She gestured toward the big clothbound score. "I have a good deal I must do."
Now she had begun to look apprehensive.
"It's necessary." He got out the Voigt-Kampff instruments, began setting them up.
"An IQ test?
"No. Empathy."
"I'll have to put on my glasses." She reached to open a drawer of her dressing table.
"If you can mark the score without your glasses you can take this test. I'll show you some pictures
and ask you several questions. Meanwhile - " He got up and walked to her, and, bending, pressed
the adhesive pad of sensitive grids against her deeply tinted check. "And this light," he said, adjusting
the angle of the pencil beam, "and that's it."
"Do you think I'm an android? Is that it?" Her voice had faded almost to extinction. "I'm not an
android. I haven't even been on Mars; I've never even seen an android!" Her elongated lashes
shuddered involuntarily; he saw her trying to appear calm. "Do you have information that there's an
android in the cast? I'd be glad to help you, and if I were an android would I be glad to help you?"
"An android," he said, "doesn't care what happens to any other android. That's one of the
indications we look for."
"Then," Miss Luft said, "you must be an android."
That stopped him; he stared at her.
"Because," she continued, "Your job is to kill them, isn't it? You're what they call - " She tried to
remember.

46

"A bounty hunter," Rick said. "But I'm not an android."
"This test you want to give me." Her voice, now, had begun to return. "Have you taken it?"
"Yes." He nodded. "A long, long time ago; when I first started with the department."
"Maybe that's a false memory. Don't androids sometimes go around with false memories?"
Rick said, "My superiors know about the test. It's mandatory.
"Maybe there was once a human who looked like you, and somewhere along the line you killed
him and took his place. And your superiors don't know." She smiled. As if inviting him to agree.
"Let's get on with the test," he said, getting out the sheets of questions.
"I'll take the test," Luba Luft said, "if you'll take it first."
Again he stared at her, stopped in his tracks.
"Wouldn't that be more fair?" she asked. "Then I could be sure of you. I don't know; you seem so
peculiar and hard and strange." She shivered, then smiled again. Hopefully.
"You wouldn't be able to administer the Voigt-Kampff test. It takes considerable experience.
Now please listen carefully. These questions will deal with social situations which you might find
yourself in; what I want from you is a statement of response, what you'd do. And I want the
response as quickly as you can give it. One of the factors I'll record is the time lag, if any." He
selected his initial question. "You're sitting watching TV and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling
on your wrist." He checked with his watch, counting the seconds. And checked, too, with the twin
dials.
"What's a wasp?" Luba Luft asked.
"A stinging bug that flies."
"Oh, how strange." Her immense eyes widened with child-like acceptance, as if he had revealed
the cardinal mystery of creation. "Do they still exist? I've never seen one."
"They died out because of the dust. Don't you really know what a wasp is? You must have been
alive when there were wasps; that's only been - "
"Tell me the German word."
He tried to think of the German word for wasp but couldn't. "Your English is perfect," he said
angrily.
"My accent," she corrected, "is perfect. It has to be, for roles, for Purcell and Walton and Vaughn
Williams. But my vocabulary isn't very large." She glanced at him shyly.
"Wespe," he said, remembering the German word.
"Ach yes; eine Wespe." She laughed. "And what was the question? I forget already."
"Let's try another." Impossible now to get a meaningful response. "You are watching an old movie
on TV, a movie from before the war. It shows a banquet in progress; the entrée" - he skipped over
the first part of the question - "consists of boiled dog, stuffed with rice."
"Nobody would kill and cat a dog," Luba Luft said. "They're worth a fortune. But I guess it would
be an imitation dog: ersatz. Right? But those are made of wires and motors; they can't be eaten."
"Before the war," he grated.
"I wasn't alive before the war."
"But you've seen old movies on TV."
"Was the movie made in the Philippines?"
"Why?"
"Because," Luba Luft said, "they used to cat boiled dog stuffed with rice in the Philippines. I
remember reading that."
"But your response," he said. "I want your social, emotional, moral reaction."
"To the movie?" She pondered. "I'd turn it off and watch Buster Friendly."

47

"Why would you turn it off?"
"Well," she said hotly, "who the hell wants to watch an old movie set in the Philippines? What ever
happened in the Philippines except the Bataan Death March, and would you want to watch that?"
She glared at him indignantly. On his dials the needles swung in all directions.
After a pause he said carefully, "You rent a mountain cabin."
"Ja." She nodded. "Go on; I'm waiting."
"In an area still verdant."
"Pardon?" She cupped her ear. "I don't ever hear that term."
"Still trees and bushes growing. The cabin is rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace. On the walls
someone has hung old snaps, Currier and Ives prints, and above the fireplace a deer's head has been
mounted, a full stag with developed horns. The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and - "
"I don't understand 'Currier' or 'Ives' or 'decor,"' Luba Luft said; she seemed to be struggling,
however, to make out the terms. "Wait." She held up her hand earnestly. "With rice, like in the dog.
Currier is what makes the rice currier rice. It's Curry in German."
He could not fathom, for the life of him, if Luba Luft's semantic fog had purpose. After
consultation with himself he decided to try another question; what else could he do? "You're dating a
man," he said, "and he asks you to visit his apartment. While you're there - "
"O nein," Luba broke in. "I wouldn't be there. That's easy to answer."
"That's not the question!"
"Did you get the wrong question? But I understand that; why is a question I understand the wrong
one? Aren't I supposed to understand?" Nervously fluttering she rubbed her cheek and detached the
adhesive disk. It dropped to the floor, skidded, and rolled under her dressing table. "Ach Gott," she
muttered, bending to retrieve it. A ripping sound, that of cloth tearing. Her elaborate costume.
"I'll get it," he said, and lifted her aside; he knelt down, groped under the dressing table until his
fingers located the disk.
When he stood up he found himself looking into a laser tube.
"Your questions," Luba Luft said in a crisp, formal voice, "began to do with sex. I thought they
would finally. You're not from the police department; you're a sexual deviant."
"You can look at my identification." He reached toward his coat pocket. His hand, he saw, had
again begun to shake, as it had with Polokov.
"If you reach in there," Luba Luft said, "I'll kill you."
"You will anyhow." He wondered how it would have worked out if he had waited until Rachael
Rosen could join him. Well, no use dwelling on that.
"Let me see some more of your questions." She held out her hand and, reluctantly, he passed her
the sheets. "'In a magazine you come across a full-page color picture of a nude girl.' Well, that's one.
'You became pregnant by a man who has promised to marry you. The man goes off with another
woman, your best friend; you get an abortion.' The pattern of your questioning is obvious. I'm going
to call the police." Still holding the laser tube in his direction she crossed the room, picked tip the
vidphone, dialed the operator. "Connect me with the San Francisco Police Department," she said. "I
need a policeman."
"What you're doing," Rick said, with relief, "is the best idea possible." Yet it seemed strange to
him that Luba had decided to do this; why didn't she simply kill him? Once the patrolman arrived her
chance would disappear and it all would go his way.
She must think she's human, he decided. Obviously she doesn't know.
A few minutes later, during which Luba carefully kept the laser tube on him, a large harness bull
arrived, in his archaic blue uniform with gun and star. "All right," he said at once to Luba. "Put that

48

thing away." She set down the laser tube and he picked it up to examine it, to see if it carried a
charge. "Now what's been going on here?" he asked her. Before she could answer he turned to
Rick. "Who are you?" he demanded.
Luba Luft said, "He came into my dressing room; I've never seen him before in my life. He
pretended to be taking a poll or something and he wanted to ask me questions; I thought it was all
right and I said okay, and then he began asking me obscene questions."
"Let's see your identification," the harness bull said to Rick, his hand extended.
As he got out his ID Rick said, "I'm a bounty hunter with the department."
"I know all the bounty hunters," the harness bull said to Rick as he examined Rick's wallet. "With
the S. F. Police Department? "
"My supervisor is Inspector Harry Bryant," Rick said. "I've taken over Dave Holden's list, now
that Dave's in the hospital."
"As I say, I know all the bounty hunters," the harness bull said, "and I've never heard of you." He
handed Rick's ID back to him.
"Call Inspector Bryant," Rick said.
"There isn't any Inspector Bryant," the harness bull said.
It came to Rick what was going on. "You're an android," he said to the harness bull. "Like Miss
Luft." Going to the vidphone he picked up the receiver himself. "I'm going to call the department." He
wondered how far be would get before the two androids stopped him.
"The number," the harness bull said, "is - "
"I know the number." Rick dialed, presently had the police switchboard operator. "Let me talk to
Inspector Bryant," he said.
"Who is calling, please?"
"This is Rick Deckard." He stood waiting; meanwhile, off to one side, the harness bull was getting
a statement from Luba Luft; neither paid any attention to him.
A pause and then Harry Bryant's face appeared on the vidscreen. "What's doing?" he asked Rick.
"Some trouble," Rick said. "One of those on Dave's list managed to call in and get a so-called
patrolman out here. I can't seem to prove to him who I am; he says he knows all the about hunters in
the department and he's never heard of me." He added, "He hasn't heard of you either."
Bryant said, "Let me talk to him."
"Inspector Bryant wants to talk to you." Rick held out the vidphone receiver. The harness bull
ceased questioning Miss Luft and came over to take it.
"Officer Crams," the harness bull said briskly. A pause. "Hello?" He listened, said hello several
times more, waited, then turned to Rick. "There's nobody on the line. And nobody on the screen."
He pointed to the vidphone screen and Rick saw nothing on it.
Taking the receiver from the harness bull Rick said, "Mr. Bryant?" He listened, waited; nothing.
"I'll dial again." He hung up, waited, then redialed the familiar number. The phone rang, but no one
answered it; the phone rang on and on.
"Let me try," Officer Crams said, taking the receiver away from Rick. "You must have misdialed
"He dialed. "The number is 842 - "
"I know the number," Rick said.
"Officer Crams calling in," the harness bull said into the Phone receiver. "Is there an Inspector
Bryant connected with the department?" A short pause. "Well, what about a bounty hunter named
Rick Deckard?" Again a pause. "You're sure? Could he have recently - oh, I see; okay, thanks. No,
I have it under control." Officer Crams rang off, turned toward Rick.

49

"I had him on the line," Rick said. "I talked to him; he said he'd talk to you. It must be phone
trouble; the connection must have been broken somewhere along the way. Didn't you see - Bryant's
face showed on the screen and then it didn't." He felt bewildered.
Officer Crams said, "I have Miss Luft's statement, Deckard. So let's go down to the Hall of
Justice so I can book you."
"Okay," Rick said. To Luba Luft he said, "I'll be back in a short while. I'm still not finished testing
you."
"He's a deviant," Luba Luft said to Officer Crams. "He gives me the creeps." She shivered.
"What opera are you practicing to give?" Officer Crams asked her.
"The Magic Flute," Rick said.
"I didn't ask you; I asked her." The harness buff gave him a glance of dislike.
"I'm anxious to get to the Hall of Justice," Rick said. "This matter should be straightened out." He
started toward the door of the dressing room, his briefcase gripped.
"I'll search you first." Officer Crams deftly frisked him, and came up with Rick's service pistol and
laser tube. He appropriated both, after a moment of sniffing the muzzle of the pistol. "This has been
fired recently," he said.
"I retired an andy just now," Rick said. "The remains are still in my car, up on the roof."
"Okay," Officer Crams said. "We'll go up and have a look."
As the two of them started from the dressing room, Miss Luft followed as far as the door. "He
won't come back again, will he, Officer? I'm really afraid of him; he's so strange."
"If he's got the body of someone he killed upstairs in his car," Crams said, "he won't be coming
back." He nudged Rick forward and, together, the two of them ascended by elevator to the roof of
the opera house.
Opening the door of Rick's car, Officer Crams silently inspected the body of Polokov.
"An android," Rick said. "I was sent after him. He almost got me by pretending to be - "
"They'll take your statement at the Hall of Justice," Officer Crams interrupted. He nudged Rick
over to his parked, plainly marked police car; there, by police radio, he put in a call for someone to
come pick up Polokov. "Okay, Deckard," he said, then, ringing off. "Let's get started."
With the two of them aboard, the patrol car zummed up from the roof and headed south.
Something, Rick noticed, was not as it should be. Officer Crams had steered the car in the wrong
direction.
"The Hall of justice," Rick said, "is north, on Lombard."
"That's the old Hall of Justice," Officer Crams said. "The new one is on Mission. That old building,
it's disintegrating; it's a ruin. Nobody's used that for years. Has it been that long since you last got
booked?"
"Take me there," Rick said. "To Lombard Street." He understood it all, now; saw what the
androids, working together, had achieved. He would not live beyond this ride; for him it was the end,
as it had almost been for Dave - and probably eventually would be.
"That girl's quite a looker," Officer Crams said. "Of course, with that costume you can't tell about
her figure. But I'd say it's damn okay."
Rick said, "Admit to me that you're an android."
"Why? I'm not an android. What do you do, roam around killing people and telling yourself they're
androids? I can see why Miss Luft was scared. It's a good thing for her that she called us."
"Then take me to the Hall of Justice, on Lombard."
"Like I said - "

50

"It'll take about three minutes," Rick said. "I want to see it. Every morning I check in for work,
there; I want to see that it's been abandoned for years, as you say."
"Maybe you're an android," Officer Crams said. "With a false memory, like they give them. Had
you thought of that?" He grinned frigidly as he continued to drive south.
Conscious of his defeat and failure, Rick settled back. And, helplessly, waited for what came next.
Whatever the androids had planned, now that they had physical possession of him.
But I did get one of them, he told himself; I got Polokov. And Dave got two.
Hovering over Mission, Officer Crams's police car prepared to descend for its landing.

51

TEN
The Mission Street Hall of Justice building, onto the roof of which the hovercar descended, jutted
up in a series of baroque, ornamented spires; complicated and modem, the handsome structure
struck Rick Deckard as attractive - except for one aspect. He had never seen it before.
The police hovercar landed. And, a few minutes later, he found himself being booked.
"304," Officer Crams said to the sergeant at the high desk. "And 612.4 and let's see. Representing
himself to be a peace officer."
"406.7 the desk sergeant said, filling out the forms; he wrote leisurely, in a slightly bored manner.
Routine business, his posture and expression declared. Nothing of importance.
"Over here," Officer Crams said to Rick, leading him to a small white table at which a technician
operated familiar equipment. "For your cephalic pattern," Crams said. "Identpurposes."
Rick said brusquely, "I know." In the old days, when he had been a harness bull himself, he had
brought many suspects to a table like this. Like this, but not this particular table.
His cephatic pattern taken, he found himself being led off to an equally familiar room; reflexively he
began assembling his valuables for transfer. It makes no sense, he said to himself. Who are these
people? If this place has always existed, why didn't we know about it? And why don't they know
about us? Two parallel police agencies, he said to himself; ours and this one. But never coming in
contact - as far as I know until now. Or maybe they have, he thought. Maybe this isn't the first time.
Hard to believe, he thought, that this wouldn't have happened long ago. If this really is a police
apparatus, here; if it's what it asserts itself to be,
A man, not in uniform, detached himself from the spot at which he had been standing; he
approached Rick Deckard at a measured, unruffled pace, gazing at him curiously. "What's this one?"
he asked Officer Crams.
"Suspected homicide," Crams answered. "We have a body - we found it in his car - but he claims
it's an android. We're checking it out, giving it a bone marrow analysis at the lab. And posing as a
police officer, a bounty hunter. To gain access to a woman's dressing room in order to ask her
suggestive questions. She doubted he was what he said he was and called us in." Stepping back,
Crams said, "Do you want to finish up with him, sir? "
"All right." The senior police official, not in uniform, blue-eyed, with a narrow, flaring nose and
inexpressive lips, eyed Rick, then reached for Rick's briefcase. "What do you have in here, Mr.
Deckard? "
Rick said, "Material pertaining to the Voigt-KampfF personality test. I was testing a suspect when
Officer Crams arrested me." He watched as the police official rummaged through the contents of the
briefcase, examining each item. "The questions I asked Miss Luft are standard V-K questions,
printed on the - "
"Do you know George Gleason and Phil Resch?" the police official asked.
"No," Rick said; neither name meant anything to him.
"They're the bounty hunters for Northern California. Both are attached to our department. Maybe
you'll run into them while you're here. Are you an android, Mr. Deckard? The reason I ask is that
several times in the past we've had escaped andys turn up posing as out-of-state bounty hunters here
in pursuit of a suspect."
Rick said, "I'm not an android. You can administer the Voigt-Kampff test to me; I've taken it
before and I don't mind taking it again. But I know what the results will be. Can I phone my wife?"
"You're allowed one call. Would you rather phone her than a lawyer?"
"I'll phone my wife," Rick said. "She can get a lawyer for me."

52

The plainclothes police officer handed him a fifty-cent piece and pointed. "There's the vidphone
over there." He watched as Rick crossed the room to the phone. Then he returned to his examination
of the contents of Rick's briefcase.
Inserting the coin, Rick dialed his home phone number. And stood for what seemed like an
eternity, waiting.
A woman's face appeared on the vidscreen. "Hello," she said.
It was not Iran. He had never seen the woman before in his life.
He hung up, walked slowly back to the police officer.
"No luck?" the officer asked. "Well, you can make another call; we have a liberal policy in that
regard. I can't offer you the opportunity of calling a bondsman because your offense is unbailable, at
present. When you're arraigned, however - "
"I know," Rick said acridly. "I'm familiar with police procedure."
"Here's your briefcase," the officer said; he handed it back to Rick. "Come into my office I'd like
to talk with you further." He started down a side hall, leading the way; Rick followed. Then, pausing
and turning, the officer said, "My name is Garland." He held out his hand and they shook. Briefly. "Sit
down," Garland said as he opened his office door and pushed behind a large uncluttered desk.
Rick seated himself facing the desk.
"This Voigt-Kampff test," Garland said, that you mentioned." He indicated Rick's briefcase. "All
that material you carry." he filled and lit a pipe, puffed for a moment. "It's an analytical tool for
detecting andys?"
"It's our basic test," Rick said. "The only one we currently employ. The only one capable of
distinguishing the new Nexus-6 brain unit. You haven't heard of this test?"
"I've heard of several profile-analysis scales for use with androids. But not that one." He continued
to study Rick intently, his face turgid; Rick could not fathom what Garland was thinking. "Those
smudged carbon flimsies," Garland continued, "that you have there in your briefcase. Polokov, Miss
Luft . . . your assignments. The next one is me."
Rick stared at him, then grabbed for the briefcase.
In a moment the carbons lay spread out before him. Garland had told the truth; Rick examined the
sheet. Neither man - or rather neither he nor Garland - spoke for a time and then Garland cleared his
throat, coughed nervously.
"It's an unpleasant sensation," he said. "To find yourself a bounty hunter's assignment all of a
sudden. Or whatever it is you are, Deckard." He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said,
"Send one of the bounty hunters in here; I don't care which one. Okay; thank you." He released the
key. "Phil Resch will be in here a minute or so from now," he said to Rick. "I want to see his list
before I proceed."
"You think I might be on his list?" Rick said.
"It's possible. We'll know pretty soon. Best to be sure about these critical matters. Best not to
leave it to chance. This info sheet about me." He indicated the smudged carbon. "It doesn't list me as
a police inspector; it inaccurately gives my occupation as insurance underwriter. Otherwise it's
correct, as to physical description, age, personal habits, home address. Yes, it's me, all right. Look
for yourself." He pushed the page to Rick, who picked it up and glanced over it.
The office door opened and a tall fleshless man with hard-etched features, wearing horn-rim
glasses and a fuzzy Vandyke beard, appeared. Garland rose, indicating Rick.
"Phil Resch, Rick Deckard. You're both bounty hunters and it's probably time you met."
As he shook hands with Rick, Phil Resch said, "Which city are you attached to?"

53

Garland answered for Rick. "San Francisco. Here; take a look at his schedule. This one comes up
next." He handed Phil Resch the sheet which Rick had been examining, that with his own description.
"Say, Gar," Phil Resch said. "This is you."
"There's more," Garland said. "He's also got Luba Luft the opera singer there on his list of
retirement-assignments, and Polokov. Remember Polokov? He's now dead; this bounty hunter or
android or whatever he is got him, and we running a bone marrow test at the lab. To see if there's
any conceivable basis - "
"Polokov I've talked to," Phil Resch said. "That big Santa Claus from the Soviet police?" He
pondered, plucking at his disarrayed beard. "I think it's a good idea to run a bone marrow test on
him."
"Why do you say that?" Garland asked, clearly annoyed. "It's to remove any legal basis on which
this man Deckard could claim he hadn't killed anyone; he only 'retired an android."'
Phil Resch said, "Polokov struck me as cold. Extremely cerebral and calculating; detached."
"A lot of the Soviet police are that way," Garland said, visibly nettled.
"Luba Luft I never met," Phil Resch said. "Although I've heard records she's made." To Rick he
said, "Did you test her out? "
"I started to," Rick said. "But I couldn't get an accurate reading. And she called in a harness bull,
which ended it."
"And Polokov?" Phil Resch asked.
"I never got a chance to test him either."
Phil Resch said, mostly to himself, "And I assume you haven't had an opportunity to test out
Inspector Garland, here."
"Of course not," Garland interjected, his face wrinkled with indignation; his words broke off, bitter
and sharp.
"What test do you use?" Phil Resch asked.
"The Voigt-Kampff scale."
"Don't know that particular one." Both Resch and Garland seemed deep in rapid, professional
thought-but not in unison. "I've always said," he continued, "that the best place for an android would
be with a big police organization such as W.P.O. Ever since I first met Polokov I've wanted to test
him, but no pretext ever arose. It never would have, either . . . which is one of the values such a spot
would have for an enterprising android."
Getting slowly to his feet Inspector Garland faced Phil Resch and said, "Have you wanted to test
me, too?"
A discreet smiled traveled across Phil Resch's face; he started to answer, then shrugged. And
remained silent. He did not seem afraid of his superior, despite Garland's palpable wrath.
"I don't think you understand the situation," Garland said. "This man - or android - Rick Deckard
comes to us from a phantom, hallucinatory, nonexistent police agency allegedly operating out of the
old departmental headquarters on Lombard. He's never heard of us and we've never heard of him yet ostensibly we're both working the same side of the street. He employs a test we've never heard
of. The list he carries around isn't of androids; it's a list of human beings. He's already killed once - at
least once. And if Miss Luft hadn't gotten to a phone he probably would have killed her and then
eventually he would have come sniffing around after me."
"Hmm," Phil Resch said.
"Hmm," Garland mimicked, wrathfully. He looked, now, as if he bordered on apoplexy. "Is that all
you have to say?"

54

The intercom came on and a female voice said, "Inspector Garland, the lab report on Mr.
Polokov's corpse is ready."
"I think we should hear it," Phil Resch said.
Garland glanced at him, seething. Then he bent, pressed the key of the intercom. "Let's have it,
Miss French."
"The bone marrow test," Miss French said, "shows that Mr. Polokov was a humanoid robot. Do
you want a detailed - "
"No, that's enough." Garland settled back in his seat, grimly contemplating the far wall; he said
nothing to either Rick or Phil Resch.
Resch said, "What is the basis of your Voigt-Kampff test, Mr. Deckard?"
"Empathic response. In a variety of social situations. Mostly having to do with animals."
"Ours is probably simpler," Resch said. The reflex-arc response taking place in the upper ganglia
of the spinal column requires several microseconds more in the humanoid robot than in a human
nervous system." Reaching across Inspector Garland's desk he plucked a pad of paper toward him;
with a ball-point pen he drew a sketch. "We use an audio signal or a light-flash. The subject presses
a button and the elapsed time is measured. We try it a number of times, of course. Elapsed time
varies in both the andy and the human. But by the time ten reactions have been measured, we believe
we have a reliable clue. And, as in your case with Polokov, the bone marrow test backs us up."
An interval of silence passed and then Rick said, "You can test me out. I'm ready. Of course I'd
like to test you, too. If you're willing."
"Naturally," Resch said. He was, however, studying Inspector Garland. "I've said for years,"
Resch murmured, that the Boneli Reflex-Arc Test should be applied routinely to police personnel the
higher up the chain of command the better. Haven't I, Inspector?"
"That's right you have," Garland said. "And I've always opposed it. On the grounds that it would
lower department morale."
"I think now," Rick said, "you're going to have to sit still for it. In view of your lab's report on
Polokov."

55

ELEVEN
Garland said, "I guess so." He jabbed a finger at the bounty hunter Phil Resch. "But I'm warning
you: you're not going to like the results of the tests."
"Do you know what they'll be?" Resch asked, with visible surprise; he did not look pleased.
"I know almost to a hair," Inspector Garland said.
"Okay." Resch nodded. "I'll go upstairs and get the Boneli gear." He strode to the door of the
office, opened it, and disappeared out into the hall. "I'll be back in three or four minutes," he said to
Rick. The door shut after him.
Reaching into the right-hand top drawer of his desk, Inspector Garland fumbled about, then
brought forth a laser tube; he swiveled it until it pointed at Rick.
"That's not going to make any difference," Rick said. "Resch will have a postmortem run on me,
the same as your lab ran on Polokov. And he'll still insist on a - what did you call it - Boneli ReflexArc Test on you and on himself."
The laser tube remained in its position, and then Inspector Garland said, "It was a bad day all day.
Especially when I saw Officer Crams bringing you in; I had an intuition - that's why I intervened." By
degrees he lowered the laser beam; he sat gripping it and then he shrugged and returned it to the
desk drawer, locking the drawer and restoring the key to his pocket.
"What will tests on the three of us show?" Rick asked.
Garland said, "That damn fool Resch."
"He actually doesn't know?"
"He doesn't know; he doesn't suspect; he doesn't have the slightest idea. Otherwise he couldn't
live out a life as a bounty hunter, a human occupation - hardly an android occupation." Garland
gestured toward Rick's briefcase. "Those other carbons, the other suspects you're supposed to test
and retire. I know them all." He paused, then said, "We all came here together on the same ship from
Mars. Not Resch; he stayed behind another week, receiving the synthetic memory system." He was
silent, then.
Or rather it was silent.
Rick said, "What'll he do when he finds out?"
"I don't have the foggiest idea," Garland said remotely. "It ought, from an abstract, intellectual
viewpoint, to be interesting. He may kill me, kill himself; maybe you, too. He may kill everyone he
can, human and android alike. I understand that such things happen, when there's been a synthetic
memory system laid down. When one thinks it's human."
"So when you do that, you're taking a chance."
Garland said, "It's a chance anyway, breaking free and coming here to Earth, where we're not
even considered animals. Where every worm and wood louse is considered more desirable than all
of us put together." Irritably, Garland picked at his lower lip. "Your position would be better r if Phil
Resch could pass the Boneli test, if it was just me. The results, that way, would be predictable; to
Resch I'd just be another andy to retire as soon as possible. So you're not in a good position either,
Deckard. Almost as bad, in fact, as I am. You know where I guessed wrong? I didn't know about
Polokov. He must have come here earlier; obviously he came here earlier. In another group entirely no contact with ours. He was already entrenched in the W.P.O. when I arrived. I took a chance on
the lab report, which I shouldn't have. Crams, of course, took the same chance."
"Polokov was almost my finish, too," Rick said.

56

"Yes, there was something about him. I don't think he could have been the same brain unit type as
we; he must have been souped up or tinkered with - an altered structure, unfamiliar even to us. A
good one, too. Almost good enough."
"When I phoned my apartment," Rick said, "why didn't I get my wife?"
"All our vidphone lines here are trapped. They recirculate the call to other offices within the
building. This is a homeostatic enterprise we're operating here, Deckard. We're a closed loop, cut
off from the rest of San Francisco. We know about them but they don't know about us. Sometimes
an isolated person such as yourself wanders in here or, as in your case, is brought here - for our
protection." He gestured convulsively toward the office door. "Here comes eager-beaver Phil Resch
back with his handy dandy portable little test. Isn't he clever? He's going to destroy his own life and
mine and possibly yours."
"You androids," Rick said, "don't exactly cover for each other in times of stress."
Garland snapped, "I think you're right; it would seem we lack a specific talent you humans
possess. I believe it's called empathy."
The office door opened; Phil Resch stood outlined, carrying a device which trailed wires. "Here
we are," he said, closing the door after him; he seated himself, plugging the device into the electrical
outlet.
Bringing out his right hand, Garland pointed at Resch. At once Resch - and also Rick Deckard rolled from their chairs and onto the floor; at the same time, Resch . aimed a laser tube and, as he
fell, fired at Garland.
The laser beam, aimed with skill, based on years of training, bifurcated Inspector Garland's head.
He slumped forward and, from his hand, his miniaturized laser beam rolled across the surface of his
desk. The corpse teetered on its chair and then, like a sack of eggs, it slid to one side and crashed to
the floor.
"It forgot," Resch said, rising to his feet, "that this is my job. I can almost foretell what an android
is going to, do. I suppose you can, too." He put his laser beam away, bent, and, with curiosity,
examined the body of his quondam superior. "What did it say to you while I was gone?"
"That he - it - was an android. And you - " Rick broke off, the conduits of his brain humming,
calculating, and selecting; he altered what he had started to say. " - would detect it," he finished. "In a
few more minutes."
"Anything else?"
"This building is android-infested."
Resch said introspectively, "That's going to make it hard for you and me to get out of here.
Nominally I have the authority to leave any time I want, of course. And to take a prisoner with me."
He listened; no sound came from beyond the office. "I guess they didn't hear anything. There's
evidently no bug installed here, monitoring everything as there should be." Gingerly, he nudged the
body of the android with the toe of his shoe. "It certainly is remarkable, the psionic ability you
develop in this business; I knew before I opened the office door that he would take a shot at me.
Frankly I'm surprised he didn't kill you while I was upstairs,"
"He almost did," Rick said. "He had a big utility-model laser beam on me part of the time. He was
considering it. But it was you he was worried about, not me."
"The android flees," Resch said humorlessly, "where the bounty bunter pursues. You realize, don't
you, that you're going to have to double back to the opera house and get Luba Luft before anyone
here has a chance to warn her as to how this came out. Warn it, I should say. Do you think of them
as 'it'? "

57

"I did at one time," Rick said. "When my conscience occasionally bothered me about the work I
had to do; I protected myself by thinking of them that way but now I no longer find it necessary. All
right, I'll head directly back to the opera house. Assuming you can get me out of here."
"Suppose we sit Garland up at his desk," Resch said; he dragged the corpse of the android back
up into its chair, arranging its arms and legs so that its posture appeared reasonably natural - if no
one looked closely. If no one came into the office. Pressing a key on the desk intercom, Phil Resch
said, "Inspector Garland has asked that no calls be put through to him for the next half hour. He's
involved in work that can't be interrupted."
"Yes, Mr. Resch."
Releasing the intercom key, Phil Resch said to Rick, "I'm going to handcuff you to me during the
time we're still here in the building. Once we're airborne I'll naturally let you go." He produced a pair
of cuffs, slapped one onto Rick's wrist and the other around his own. "Come on; let's get it over
with." He squared his shoulders, took a deep breath, and pushed open the office door.
Uniformed police stood or sat on every side, conducting their routine business of the day; none of
them glanced up or paid any attention as Phil Resch led Rick across the lobby to the elevator.
"What I'm afraid of," Resch said as they waited for the elevator, "is that the Garland one had a
dead man's throttle warning component built into it. But - " He shrugged. "I would have expected it
to go off by now; otherwise it's not much good."
The elevator arrived; several police-like nondescript men and women disemelevatored, cracked
off across the lobby on their several errands. They paid no attention to Rick or Phil Resch.
"Do you think your department will take me on?" Resch asked, as the elevator doors shut, closing
the two of them inside; he punched the roof button and the elevator silently rose. "After all, as of now
I'm out of a job. To say the least."
Guardedly, Rick said, "I - don't see why not. Except that we already have two bounty hunters."
I've got to tell him, he said to himself. It's unethical and cruel not to. Mr. Resch, you're an android, he
thought to himself. You got me out of this place and here's your reward; you're everything we jointly
abominate. The essence of what we're committed to destroy.
"I can't get over it," Phil Resch said. "It doesn't seem possible. For three years I've been working
under the direction of androids. Why didn't I suspect - I mean, enough to do something?"
"Maybe it isn't that long. Maybe they only recently infiltrated this building."
"They've been here all the time. Garland has been my superior from the start, throughout my three
years."
"According to it," Rick said, "the bunch of them came to Earth together. And that wasn't as long
ago as three years; it's only been a matter of months."
"Then at one time an authentic Garland existed," Phil Resch said. "And somewhere along the way
got replaced." His sharklike lean face twisted and he struggled to understand. "Or - I've been
impregnated with a false memory system. Maybe I only remember Garland over the whole time. But
- " His face, suffused now with growing torment, continued to twist and work spasmodically. "Only
androids show up with false memory systems; it's been found ineffective in humans."
The elevator ceased rising; its doors slid back, and there, spread out ahead of them, deserted
except for empty parked vehicles, lay the police station's roof field.
"Here's my car," Phil Resch said, unlocking the door of a nearby hovercar and waving Rick
rapidly inside; he himself got in behind the wheel and started up the motor. In a moment they had
lifted into the sky and, turning north, headed back in the direction of the War Memorial Opera
House. Preoccupied, Phil Resch drove by reflex; his progressively more gloomy train of thought
continued to dominate his attention. "Listen, Deckard," he said suddenly. "After we retire Luba Luft -

58

I want you to - " His voice, husky and tormented, broke off. "You know. Give me the Boneli test or
that empathy scale you have. To see about me."
"We can worry about that later," Rick said evasively "You don't want me to take it, do you?" Phil
Resch glanced at him with acute comprehension. "I guess you know what the results will be; Garland
must have told you something. Facts which I don't know."
Rick said, "It's going to be hard even for the two of us to take out Luba Luft; she's more than I
could handle, anyhow. Let's keep our attention focused on that."
"It's not just false memory structures," Phil Resch said. "I own an animal; not a false one but the
real thing. A squirrel. I love the squirrel, Deckard; every goddamn morning I feed it and change its
papers - you know, clean up its cage - and then in the evening when I get off work I let it loose in my
apt and it runs all over the place. It has a wheel in its cage; ever seen a squirrel running inside a
wheel? It runs and runs, the wheel spins, but the squirrel stays in the same spot. Buffy seems to like
it, though."
"I guess squirrels aren't too bright," Rick said.
They flew on, then, in silence.

59

TWELVE
At the opera house Rick Deckard and Phil Resch were informed that the rehearsal had ended.
And Miss Luft had left.
"Did she say where she intended to go?" Phil Resch asked the stagehand, showing his police
identification.
"Over to the museum." The stagehand studied the ID card. "She said she wanted to take in the
exhibit of Edvard Munch that's there, now. It ends tomorrow."
And Luba Luft, Rick thought to himself, ends today.
As the two of them walked down the sidewalk to the museum, Phil Resch said, "What odds will
you give? She's flown; we won't find her at the museum."
"Maybe," Rick said.
They arrived at the museum building, noted on which floor the Munch exhibit could be found, and
ascended. Shortly, they wandered amid paintings and woodcuts. Many people had turned out for the
exhibit, including a grammar school class; the shrill voice of the teacher penetrated all the rooms
comprising the exhibit, and Rick thought, That's what you'd expect an andy to sound - and look like. Instead of like Rachael Rosen and Luba Luft. And - the man beside him. Or rather the thing
beside him.
"Did you ever hear of an andy having a pet of any sort?" Phil Resch asked him.
For sonic obscure reason he felt the need to be brutally honest; perhaps he had already begun
preparing himself for what lay ahead. "In two cases that I know of, andys owned and cared for
animals. But it's rare. From what I've been able to learn, it generally fails; the andy is unable to keep
the animal alive. Animals require an environment of warmth to flourish. Except for reptiles and
insects."
"Would a squirrel need that? An atmosphere of love? Because Buffy is doing fine, as sleek as an
otter. I groom and comb him every other day." At an oil painting Phil Resch halted, gazed intently.
The painting showed a hairless, oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear, its hands
clapped in horror to its ears, its mouth open in a vast, soundless scream. Twisted ripples of the
creature's torment, echoes of its cry, flooded out into the air surrounding it; the man or woman,
whichever it was, had become contained by its own howl. It had covered its ears against its own
sound. The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present; the creature screamed in
isolation. Cut off by - or despite - its outcry.
"He did a woodcut of this," Rick said, reading the card tacked below the painting.
"I think," Phil Resch said, "that this is how an andy must feet." He traced in the air the
convolutions, visible in the picture, of the creature's cry. "I don't feel like that, so maybe I'm not an - "
He broke off, as several persons strolled up to inspect the picture.
"There's Luba Luft." Rick pointed and Phil Resch halted his somber introspection and defense; the
two of them walked at a measured pace toward her, taking their time as if nothing confronted them;
as always it was vital to preserve the atmosphere of the commonplace. Other humans, having no
knowledge of the presence of androids among them, had to be protected at all costs - even that of
losing the quarry.
Holding a printed catalogue, Luba Luft, wearing shiny tapered pants and an illuminated gold
vestlike top, stood absorbed in the picture before her: a drawing of a young girl, hands clasped
together, seated on the edge of a bed, an expression of bewildered wonder and new, groping awe
imprinted on the face.

60

"Want me to buy it for you?" Rick said to Luba Luft; he stood beside her, holding laxly onto her
upper arm, informing her by his loose grip that he knew he had possession of her - he did not have to
strain in an effort to detain her. On the other side of her Phil Resch put his hand on her shoulder and
Rick saw the bulge of the laser tube. Phil Resch did not intend to take chances, not after the near
miss with Inspector Garland.
"It's not for sale." Luba Luft glanced at him idly, then violently as she recognized him; her eyes
faded and the color dimmed from her face, leaving it cadaverous, as if already starting to decay. As if
life had in an instant retreated to some point far inside her, leaving the body to its automatic ruin. "I
thought they arrested you. Do you mean they let you go?"
"Miss Luft," he said, "this is Mr. Resch. Phil Resch, this is the quite well-known opera singer Luba
Luft." To Luba he said, "The harness bull that arrested me is an android. So was his superior. Do
you know - did you know - an Inspector Garland? He told me that you all came here in one ship as
a group."
"The police department which you called," Phil Resch said to her, "operating out of a building on
Mission, is the organizing agency by which it would appear your group keeps in touch. They even
feel confident enough to hire a human bounty hunter; evidently - "
"You?" Luba Luft said. "You're not human. No more than I am: you're an android, too."
An interval of silence passed and then Phil Resch said in a low but controlled voice, "Well, we'll
deal with that at the proper time." To Rick he said, "Let's take her to my car."
One of them on each side of her they prodded her in the direction of the museum elevator. Luba
Luft did not come willingly, but on the other hand she did not actively resist; seemingly she had
become resigned. Rick had seen that before in androids, in crucial situations. The artificial life force
animating them seemed to fail if pressed too far . . . at least in some of them. But not all.
And it could flare up again furiously.
Androids, however, had as he knew an inn-ate desire to remain inconspicuous. In the museum,
with so many people roaming around, Luba Luft would tend to do nothing. The real encounter - for
her probably the final one - would take place in the car, where no one else could see. Alone, with
appalling abruptness, she could shed her inhibitions. He prepared himself - and did not think about
Phil Resch. As Resch had said, it would be dealt with at a proper time.
At the end of the corridor near the elevators, a little store-like affair had been set up; it sold prints
and art books, and Luba halted there, tarrying. "Listen," she said to Rick. Some of the color had
returned to her face; once more she looked - at least briefly - alive. "Buy me a reproduction of that
picture I was looking at when you found me. The one of the girt sitting on the bed."
After a pause Rick said to the clerk, a heavy-jowled, middle-aged woman with netted gray hair,
"Do you have a print of Munch's Puberty?"
"Only in this book of his collected work," the clerk said, lifting down a handsome glossy volume.
"Twent-five dollars."
"I'll take it." He reached for his wallet.
Phil Resch said, "My departmental budget could never in a million years be stretched - "
"My own money," Rick said; he handed the woman the bills and Luba the book. "Now let's get
started down," he said to her and Phil Resch.
"It's very nice of you," Luba said as they entered the elevator. "There's something very strange and
touching about humans. An android would never have done that." She glanced icily at Phil Resch. "It
wouldn't have occurred to him; as he said, never in a million years." She continued to gaze at Resch,
now with manifold hostility and aversion. "I really don't like androids. Ever since I got here from
Mars my life has consisted of imitating the human, doing what she would do, acting as if I had the

61

thoughts and impulses a human would have. Imitating, as far as I'm concerned, a superior life form."
To Phil Resch she said, "Isn't that how it's been with you, Resch? Trying to be - "
"I can't take this." Phil Resch dug into his coat, groped.
"No," Rick said; he grabbed at Phil Resch's hand; Resch retreated, eluding him. "The Boneli test,"
Rick said.
"It's admitted it's an android," Phil Resch said. "We don't have to wait."
"But to retire it," Rick said, "because it's needling you give me that." He struggled to pry the laser
tube away from Phil Resch. The tube remained in Phil Resch's possession; Resch circled back within
the cramped elevator, evading him, his attention on Luba Luft only. "Okay," Rick said. "Retire it; kill
it now. Show it that it's right." He saw, then, that Resch meant to. "Wait- "
Phil Resch fired, and at the same instant Luba Luft, in a spasm of frantic hunted fear, twisted and
spun away, dropping as she did so. The beam missed its mark but, as Resch lowered it, burrowed a
narrow hole, silently, into her stomach. She began to scream; she lay crouched against the wall of the
elevator, screaming. Like the picture, Rick thought to himself, and, with his own laser tube, killed her.
Luba Luft's body fell forward, face down, in a heap. It did not even tremble.
With his laser tube, Rick systematically burned into blurred ash the book of pictures which he had
just a few minutes ago bought Luba. He did the job thoroughly, saying nothing; Phil Resch watched
without understanding, his face showing his perplexity.
"You could have kept the book yourself," Resch said, when it had been done. "That cost you - "
"Do you think androids have souls?" Rick interrupted.
Cocking his head on one side, Phil Resch gazed at him in even greater puzzlement.
"I could afford the book," Rick said. "I've made three thousand dollars so far today, and I'm not
even half through."
"You're claiming Garland?" Phil Resch asked. "But I killed him, not you. You just lay there. And
Luba, too. I got her."
"You can't collect," Rick said. "Not from your own department and not from ours. When we get
to your car I'll administer the Boneli test or the Voigt-Kampff to you and then we'll see. Even though
you're not on my list." His hands shaking, he opened his briefcase, rummaged among the crumpled
onionskin carbons. "No, you're not here. So legally I can't claim you; to make anything I'll have to
claim Luba Luft and Garland."
"You're sure I'm an android? Is that really what Garland said?"
"That's what Garland said."
"Maybe he was lying," Phil Resch said. "To split us apart. As we are now. We're nuts, letting them
split us; you were absolutely right about Luba Luft - I shouldn't have let her get my goat like that. I
must be overly sensitive. That would be natural for a bounty hunter, I suppose; you're probably the
same way. But look; we would have had to retire Luba Luft anyhow, half an hour from now - only
one half hour more. She wouldn't even have had time to look through that book you got her. And I
still think you shouldn't have destroyed it; that's a waste. I can't. follow your reasoning; it isn't
rational, that's why."
Rick said, "I'm getting out of this business."
"And go into what?"
"Anything. Insurance underwriting, like Garland was supposed to be doing. Or I'll emigrate. Yes."
He nodded. "I'll go to Mars."
"But someone has to do this," Phil Resch pointed out.
"They can use androids. Much better if andys do it. I can't any more; I've had enough. She was a
wonderful singer. The planet could have used her. This is insane."

62

"This is necessary. Remember: they killed humans in order to get away. And if I hadn't gotten you
out of the Mission police station they would have killed you. That's what Garland wanted me for;
that's why he had me come down to his office. Didn't Polokov almost kill you? Didn't Luba Luft
almost? We're acting defensively; they're here on our planet - they're murderous illegal aliens
masquerading as - "
"As police," Rick said. "As bounty hunters."
"Okay; give me the Boneli test. Maybe Garland lied. I think he did - false memories just aren't that
good. What about my squirrel? "
"Yes, your squirrel. I forgot about your squirrel."
"If I'm an andy," Phil Resch said, "and you kill me, you can have my squirrel. Here; I'll write it out,
willing it to you."
"Andys can't will anything. They can't possess anything to will."
"Then just take it," Phil Resch said.
"Maybe so," Rick said. The elevator had reached the first floor, now; its doors opened. "You stay
with Luba; I'll get a patrol car here to take her to the Hall of justice. For her bone marrow test." He
saw a phone booth, entered it, dropped in a coin, and, his fingers shaking, dialed. Meanwhile a
group of people, who had been waiting for the elevator, gathered around Phil Resch and the body of
Luba Luft.
She was really a superb singer, he said to himself as he hung up the receiver, his call completed. I
don't get it; how can a talent like that be a liability to our society? But it wasn't the talent, he told
himself; it was she herself. As Phil Resch is, he thought. He's a menace in exactly the same way, for
the same reasons. So I can't quit now. Emerging from the phone booth he pushed his way among the
people, back to Resch and the prone figure of the android girl. Someone had put a coat over her.
Not Resch's.
Going up to Phil Resch - who stood off to one side vigorously smoking a small gray cigar - he said
to him, "I hope to god you do test out as an android."
"You realty hate me," Phil Resch said, marveling. "All of a sudden; you didn't hate me back on
Mission Street. Not while I was saving your life."
"I see a pattern. The way you killed Garland and then the way you killed Luba. You don't kill the
way I do; you don't try to - Hell," he said, "I know what it is. You like to kill. All you need is a
pretext. If you had a pretext you'd kill me. That's why you picked up on the possibility of Garland
being an android; it made him available for being killed. I wonder what you're going to do when you
fail to pass the Boneli test. Will you kill yourself? Sometimes androids do that." But the situation was
rare.
"Yes, I'll take care of it," Phil Resch said. "You won't have to do anything, besides administering
the test."
A patrol car arrived; two policemen hopped out, strode up, saw the crowd of people and at once
cleared themselves a passage through. One of them recognized Rick and nodded. So we can go
now, Rick realized. Our business here is concluded. Finally.
As he and Resch walked back down the street to the opera house, on whose roof their hovercar
lay parked, Resch said, "I'll give you my laser tube now. So you won't have to worry about my
reaction to the test. In terms of your own personal safety." He held out the tube and Rick accepted
it.
"How'll you kill yourself without it?" Rick asked. "If you fail on the test?
"I'll hold my breath."
"Chrissake," Rick said. "It can't be done."

63

"There's no automatic cut-in of the vagus nerve," Phil Resch said, "in an android. As there is in a
human. Weren't you taught that when they trained you? I got taught that years ago."
"But to die that way," Rick protested.
"There's no pain. What's the matter with it?"
"It's - " He gestured. Unable to find the right words.
"I don't really think I'm going to have to," Phil Resch said.
Together they ascended to the roof of the War Memorial Opera House and Phil Resch's parked
hovercar.
Sliding behind the wheel and closing his door, Phil Resch said, "I would prefer it if you used the
Boneli test."
"I can't. I don't know how to score it." I would have to rely on you for an interpretation of the
readings, he realized. And that's out of the question.
"You'll tell me the truth, won't you?" Phil Resch asked. "If I'm an android you'll tell me?"
"Sure."
"Because I really want to know. I have to know." Phil Resch relit his cigar, shifted about on the
bucket seat of the car, trying to make himself comfortable. Evidently he could not. "Did you really
like that Munch picture that Luba Luft was looking at?" he asked. "I didn't care for it. Realism in art
doesn't interest me; I like Picasso and - "
"Puberty dates from 1894," Rick said shortly. "Nothing but realism existed then; you have to take
that into account."
"But that other one, of the man holding his ears and yelling - that wasn't representational."
Opening his briefcase, Rick fished out his test gear.
"Elaborate," Phil Resch observed, watching. "How many questions do you have to ask before you
can make a determination?"
"Six or seven." He handed the adhesive pad to Phil Resch.
"Attach that to your cheek. Firmly. And this light - " He aimed it. "This stays focused on your eye.
Don't move; keep your eyeball as steady as you can."
"Reflex fluctuations," Phil Resch said acutely. "But not to the physical stimulus; you're not
measuring dilation, for instance. It'll be to the verbal questions; what we call a flinch reaction."
Rick said, "Do you think you can control it?"
"Not really. Eventually, maybe. But not the initial amplitude; that's outside conscious control. If it
weren't-" He broke off. "Go ahead. I'm tense; excuse me if I talk too much."
"Talk all you want," Rick said. Talk all the way to the tomb, he said to himself. If you feel like it. It
didn't matter to him.
"If I test out android," Phil Resch prattled, "you'll undergo renewed faith in the human race. But,
since it's not going to work out that way, I suggest you begin framing an ideology which will account
for- "
"Here's the first question," Rick said; the gear had now been set up and the needles of the two
dials quivered. "Reaction time is a factor, so answer as rapidly as you can." From memory he
selected an initial question. The test had begun.
Afterward, Rick sat in silence for a time. Then he began gathering his gear together, stuffing it back in
the briefcase.
"I can tell by your face," Phil Resch said; he exhaled in absolute, weightless, almost convulsive
relief. "Okay; you can give me my gun back." He reached out, his palm up, waiting.

64

"Evidently you were right," Rick said. "About Garland's motives. Wanting to split us up; what you
said." He felt both psychologically and physically weary.
"Do you have your ideology framed?" Phil Resch asked. "That would explain me as part of the
human race?"
Rick said, "There is a defect in your empathic, role-taking ability. One which we don't test for.
Your feelings toward androids."
"Of course we don't test for that."
"Maybe we should." He had never thought of it before, had never felt any empathy on his own
part toward the androids he killed. Always fie had assumed that throughout his psyche he
experienced the android as a clever machine - as in his conscious view. And yet, in contrast to Phil
Resch, a difference had manifested itself. And he felt instinctively that he was right. Empathy toward
an artificial construct? he asked himself. Something that only pretends to be alive? But Luba Luft had
seemed genuinely alive; it had not worn the aspect of a simulation.
"You realize," Phil Resch said quietly, "what this would do. If we included androids in our range of
empathic identification, as we do animals."
"We couldn't protect ourselves."
"Absolutely. These Nexus-6 types . . . they'd roll all over us and mash us flat. You and I, all the
bounty hunters - we stand between the Nexus-6 and mankind, a barrier which keeps the two
distinct. Furthermore - " He ceased, noticing that Rick was once again hauling out his test gear. "I
thought the test was over."
"I want to ask myself a question," Rick said. "And I want you to tell me what the needles register.
Just give me the calibration; I can compute it." He plastered the adhesive disk against his cheek,
arranged the beam of light until it fed directly into his eye. "Are you ready? Watch the dials. We'll
exclude time lapse in this; I just want magnitude."
"Sure, Rick," Phil Resch said obligingly.
Aloud, Rick said, "I'm going down by elevator with an android I've captured. And suddenly
someone kills it, without warning."
"No particular response," Phil Resch said.
"What'd the needles hit?"
"The left one 2.8. The right one 3.3"
Rick said, "A female android."
"Now they're up to 4.0 and 6. respectively."
"That's high enough," Rick said; he removed the wired adhesive disk from his cheek and shut off
the beam of light. "That's an emphatically empathic response," he said. "About what a human subject
shows for most questions. Except for the extreme ones, such as those dealing with human pelts used
decoratively . . . the truly pathological ones."
"Meaning?"
Rick said, "I'm capable of feeling empathy for at least specific, certain androids. Not for all of
them but - one or two." For Luba Luft, as an example, he said to himself. So I was wrong. There's
nothing unnatural or unhuman about Phil Resch's reactions; it's me.
I wonder, he wondered, if any human has ever felt this way before about an android.
Of course, he reflected, this may never come up again in my work; it could be an anomaly,
something for instance to do with my feelings for The Magic Flute. And for Luba's voice, in fact her
career as a whole. Certainly this had never come up before; or at least not that he had been aware
of. Not, for example, with Polokov. Nor with Garland. And, he realized, if Phil Resch had proved
out android I could have killed him without feeling anything, anyhow after Luba's death.

65

So much for the distinction between authentic living humans and humanoid constructs. In that
elevator at the museum, he said to himself, I rode down with two creatures, one human, the other
android . . . and my feelings were the reverse of those intended. Of those I'm accustomed to feel am required to feel.
"You're in a spot, Deckard," Phil Resch said; it seemed to amuse him.
Rick said, "What - should I do?"
"It's sex," Phil Resch said.
"Sex?
"Because she - it - was physically attractive. Hasn't that ever happened to you before?" Phil Resch
laughed. "We were taught that it constitutes a prime problem in bounty hunting. Don't you know,
Deckard, that in the colonies they have android mistresses?"
"It's illegal," Rick said, knowing the law about that.
"Sure it's illegal. But most variations in sex are illegal. But people do it anvhow."
"What about - not sex - but love?"
"Love is another name for sex."
"Like love of country," Rick said. "Love of music."
"If it's love toward a woman or an android imitation, it's sex. Wake up and face yourself,
Deckard. You wanted to go to bed with a female type of android - nothing more, nothing less. I felt
that way, on one occasion. When I had just started bounty hunting. Don't let it get you down; you'll
heal. What's happened is that you've got your order reversed. Don't kill her - or be present when
she's killed - and then feel physically attracted. Do it the other way."
Rick stared at him. "Go to bed with her first - "
" - and then kill her," Phil Resch said succinctly. His grainy, hardened smile remained.
You're a good bounty hunter, Rick realized. Your attitude proves it. But am I?
Suddenly, for the first time in his life, he had begun to wonder.

THIRTEEN
Like an arc of pure fire, John R. Isidore soared across the late-afternoon sky on his way home
from his job. I wonder if she's still there, he said to himself. Down in that kipple-infested old apt,
watching Buster Friendly on her TV set and quaking with fear every time she imagines someone
coming down the hall. Including, I suppose, me.
He had already stopped off at a blackmarket grocery store. On the seat beside him a bag of such
delicacies as bean curd, ripe peaches, good soft evil-smelling cheese rocked back and forth as he
alternately speeded up and slowed down his car; being tense, tonight, he drove somewhat erratically.
And his allegedly repaired car coughed and floundered, as it had been doing for months prior to
overhaul. Rats, Isidore said to himself.
The smell of peaches and cheese eddied about the car, filling his nose with pleasure. All rarities,
for which he had squandered two weeks' salary-borrowed in advance from Mr. Sloat. And, in
addition, under the car seat where it could not roll and break, a bottle of Chablis wine knocked back
and forth: the greatest rarity of all. He had been keeping it in a safety deposit box at the Bank of
America, hanging onto it and not selling it no matter how much they offered, in case at some long,
late, last moment a girl appeared. That had not happened, not until now.
The rubbish-littered, lifeless roof of his apartment building as always depressed him. Passing from
his car to the elevator door he damped down his peripheral vision; he concentrated on the valuable
bag and bottle which he carried, making certain that he tripped over no trash and took no
ignominious pratfall to economic doom. When the elevator creakily arrived he rode it - not to his
own floor - but to the lower level on which the new tenant, Pris Stratton, now lived. Presently he
stood in front of her door, rapping with the edge of the wine bottle, his heart going to pieces inside
his chest.
"Who's there?" Her voice, muffled by the door and yet clear. A frightened, but blade-sharp tone.
"This is J. R. Isidore speaking," he said briskly, adopting the new authority which he had so
recently acquired via Mr. Sloat's vidphone. "I have a few desirable items here and I think we can put
together a more than reasonable dinner."
The door, to a limited extent, opened; Pris, no lights on in the room behind her, peered out into
the dim hall. "You sound different," she said. "More grown up."
"I had a few routine matters to deal with during business hours today. The usual. If you c-c-could
let me in - "
"You'd talk about them." However, she held the door open wide enough for him to enter. And
then, seeing what he carried, she exclaimed; her face ignited with elfin, exuberant glee. But almost at
once, without warning, a lethal bitterness crossed her features, set concrete-like in place. The glee
had gone.
"What is it?" he said; he carried the packages and bottle to the kitchen, set them down and hurried
back.
Tonelessly, Pris said, "They're wasted on me."
"Why?"
"Oh. She shrugged, walking aimlessly away, her hands in the pockets of her heavy, rather oldfashioned skirt. "Sometime I'll tell you." She raised her eyes, then. "It was nice of you anyhow. Now
I wish you'd leave. I don't feel like seeing anyone." In a vague fashion she moved toward the door to
the hall; her steps dragged and she seemed depleted, her store of energy fading almost out.
"I know what's the matter with you," he said.

67

"Oh?" Her voice, as she reopened the hall door, dropped even further into uselessness, listless and
barren.
"You don't have any friends. You're a lot worse than when I saw you this morning; it's because - "
"I have friends." Sudden authority stiffened her voice; she palpably regained vigor. "Or I had.
Seven of them. That was to start with but now the bounty hunters have had time to get to work. So
some of them - maybe all of them - are dead." She wandered toward the window, gazed out at the
blackness and the few lights here and there. "I may be the only one of the eight of us left. So maybe
you're right."
"What's a bounty hunter?"
"That's right. You people aren't supposed to know. A bounty hunter is a professional murderer
who's given a list of those he's supposed to kill. He's paid a sum - a thousand dollars is the going
rate, I understand - for each he gets. Usually he has a contract with a city so he draws a salary as
well. But they keep that low so he'll have incentive."
"Are you sure?" Isidore asked.
"Yes." She nodded. "You mean am I sure he has incentive? Yes, he has incentive. He enjoys it."
"I think," Isidore said, "You're mistaken." Never in his life had he heard of such a thing. Buster
Friendly, for instance, had never mentioned it. "It's not in accord with present-day Mercerian ethics,"
he pointed out. "All life is one; 'no man is an island,' as Shakespeare said in olden times."
"John Donne."
Isidore gestured in agitation. "That's worse than anything I ever heard of. Can't you call the
police?"
"No."
"And they're after you? They're apt to come here and kill you?" He understood, now, why the girl
acted in so secretive a fashion. "No wonder you're scared and don't want to see anybody." But he
thought, It must be a delusion. She must be psychotic. With delusions of persecution. Maybe from
brain damage due to the dust; maybe she's a special. "I'll get them first," he said.
"With what?" Faintly, she smiled; she showed her small, even, white teeth
"I'll get a license to carry a laser beam. It's easy to get, out here where there's hardly anybody; the
police don't patrol - you're expected to watch out for yourself"
"How about when you're at work?"
"I'll take a leave of absence!"
Pris said, "That's very nice of you, J. R. Isidore. But if bounty hunters got the others, got Max
Polokov and Garland and Luba and Hasking and Roy Baty - " She broke off. "Roy and Irmgard
Baty. If they're dead then it really doesn't matter. They're my best friends. Why the hell don't I hear
from them, I wonder?" She cursed, angrily.
Making his way into the kitchen he got down dusty, long unused plates and bowls and glasses; he
began washing them in the sink, running the rusty hot water until it cleared - at last. Presently Pris
appeared, seated herself at the table. He uncorked the bottle of Chablis, divided the peaches and the
cheese and the bean curd.
"What's that white stuff? Not the cheese." She pointed.
"Made from soy bean whey. I wish I had some - " He broke off, flushing. "It used to be eaten with
beef gravy."
"An android," Pris murmured. "That's the sort of slip an android makes. That's what gives it
away." She came over, stood beside him, and then to his stunned surprise put her arm around his
waist and for an instant pressed against him.

68

"I'll try a slice of peach," she said, and gingerly picked out a slippery pink-orange furry slice with
her long fingers. And then, as she ate the slice of peach, she began to cry. Cold tears descended her
cheeks, splashed on the bosom of her dress. He did not know what to do, so he continued dividing
the food. "Goddamn it," she said, furiously. "Well - " She moved away from him, paced slowly, with
measured steps, about the room. " - see, we lived on Mars. That's how come I know androids." Her
voice shook but she managed to continue; obviously it meant a great deal to her to have someone to
talk to.
"And the only people on Earth that you know," Isidore said, "are your fellow ex-emigrants."
"We knew each other before the trip. A settlement near New New York. Roy Baty and Irmgard
ran a drugstore; he was a pharmacist and she handled the beauty aids, the creams and ointments; on
Mars they use a lot of skin conditioners. I - " She hesitated. "I got various drugs from Roy - I needed
them at first because - well, anyhow, it's an awful place. This " - she swept in the room, the
apartment, in one violent gesture - " this is nothing. You think I'm suffering because I'm lonely. Hell,
all Mars is lonely. Much worse than this."
"Don't the androids keep you company? I heard a commercial on - " Seating himself he ate, and
presently she too picked up the glass of wine; she sipped expressionlessly. "I understood that the
androids helped."
"The androids," she said, "are lonely, too."
"Do you like the wine?"
She set down her glass. "It's fine."
"It's the only bottle I've seen in three years."
"We came back," Pris said, "because nobody should have to live there. It wasn't conceived for
habitation, at least not within the last billion years. It's so old. You feel it in the stones, the terrible old
age. Anyhow, at first I got drugs from Roy; I lived for that new synthetic pain-killer, that silenizine.
And then I met Horst Hartman, who at that time ran a stamp store, rare postage stamps; there's so
much time on your hands that you've got to have a hobby, something you can pore over endlessly.
And Horst got me interested in pre-colonial fiction."
"You mean old books?"
"Stories written before space travel but about space travel."
"How could there have been stories about space travel before - "
"The writers," Pris said, "made it up."
"Based on what?"
"On imagination. A lot of times they turned out wrong. For example they wrote about Venus being
a jungle paradise with huge monsters and women in breastplates that glistened." She eyed him. "Does
that interest you? Big women with long braided blond hair and gleaming breastplates the size of
melons?"
"No," he said.
"Irmgard is blond," Pris said. "But small. Anyhow, there's a fortune to be made in smuggling precolonial fiction, the old magazines and books and films, to Mars. Nothing is as exciting. To read
about cities and huge industrial enterprises, and really successful colonization. You can imagine what
it might have been like. What Mars ought to be like. Canals."
"Canals?" Dimly, he remembered reading about that; in the olden days they had believed in canals
on Mars.
"Crisscrossing the planet," Pris said. "And beings from other stars. With infinite wisdom. And
stories about Earth, set in our time and even later. Where there's no radioactive dust."
"I would think," Isidore said, "it would make you feel worse."

69

"It doesn't," Pris said curtly.
"Did you bring any of that pre-colonial reading material back with you? " It occurred to him that
he ought to try some.
"It's worthless, here, because here on Earth the craze never caught on. Anyhow there's plenty
here, in the libraries; that's where we get all of ours - stolen from libraries here on Earth and shot by
autorocket to Mars. You're out at night humbling across the open space, and all of a sudden you see
a flare, and there's a rocket, cracked open, with old pre-colonial fiction magazines spilling out
everywhere. A fortune. But of course you read them before you sell them." She warmed to her topic.
"Of all - "
A knock sounded on the hall door.
Ashen, Pris whispered, "I can't go. Don't make any noise; just sit." She strained, listening. "I
wonder if the door's locked," she said almost inaudibly. "God, I hope so." Her eyes, wild and
powerful, fixed themselves beseechingly on him, as if praying to him to make it true.
A far-off voice from the hall called, "Pris, are you in there?" A man's voice. "It's Roy and Irmgard.
We got your card."
Rising and going into the bedroom, Pris reappeared carrying a pen and scrap of paper; she
reseated herself, scratched out a hasty message.
YOU GO TO THE DOOR.
Isidore, nervously, took the pen from her and wrote:
AND SAY WHAT?
With anger, Pris scratched out:
SEE IF IT'S REALLY THEM.
Getting up, he walked glumly into the living room. How would I know if it was them? he inquired
of himself. He opened the door.
Two people stood in the dim hall, a small woman, lovely in the manner of Greta Garbo, with blue
eyes and yellow-blond hair; the man larger, with intelligent eyes but flat, Mongolian features which
gave him a brutal look. The woman wore a fashionable wrap, high shiny boots, and tapered pants;
the man lounged in a rumpled shirt and stained trousers, giving an air of almost deliberate vulgarity.
He smiled at Isidore but his bright, small eyes remained oblique.
"We're looking - " the small blond woman began, but then she saw past Isidore; her face
dissolved in rapture and she whisked past him, calling. "Pris! How are you?" Isidore turned. The two
women were embracing. He stepped aside, and Roy Baty entered, somber and large, smiling his
crooked, tuneless smile.

70

FOURTEEN
"Can we talk?" Roy said, indicating Isidore.
Pris, vibrant with bliss, said, "It's okay up to a point." To Isidore she said, "Excuse us." She led the
Batys off to one side and muttered at them; then the three of them returned to confront J. R. Isidore,
who felt uncomfortable and out of place. "This is Mr. Isidore," Pris said. "He's taking care of me."
The words came out tinged with an almost malicious sarcasm; Isidore blinked. "See? He brought me
some natural food."
"Food," Irmgard Baty echoed, and trotted lithely into the kitchen to see. "Peaches," she said,
immediately picking up a bowl and spoon; smiling at Isidore she ate with brisk little animal bites. Her
smile, different from Pris's, provided simple warmth; it had no veiled overtones.
Going after her - he felt attracted to her - Isidore said, "You're from Mars."
"Yes, we gave up." Her voice bobbed, as, with birdish acumen, her blue eyes sparkled at him.
"What an awful building you live in. Nobody else lives here, do they? We didn't see any other fights."
"I live upstairs," Isidore said.
"Oh, I thought you and Pris were maybe living together." Irmgard Baty did not sound
disapproving; she meant it, obviously, as merely a statement.
Dourly - but still smiling his smile - Roy Baty said, "Well, they got Polokov."
The joy which had appeared on Pris's face at seeing her friends at once melted away. "Who else?"
"They got Garland," Roy Baty said. "They got Anders and Gitchel and then just a little earlier
today they got Luba." He delivered the news as if, perversely, it pleased him to be telling this. As if
he derived pleasure from Pris's shock. "I didn't think they'd get Luba; remember I kept saying that
during the trip?"
"So that leaves - " Pris said.
"The three of us," Irmgard said with apprehensive urgency.
"That's why we're here." Roy Baty's voice boomed out with new, unexpected warmth; the worse
the situation the more he seemed to enjoy it. Isidore could not fathom him in the slightest.
"Oh god," Pris said, stricken.
"Well, they had this investigator, this bounty hunter," Irmgard said in agitation, "named Dave
Holden." Her lips dripped venom at the name. "And then Polokov almost got him."
"Almost got him," Roy echoed, his smile now immense.
"So he's in this hospital, this Holden," Irmgard continued. "And evidently they gave his list to
another bounty hunter, and Polokov almost got him, too. But it wound up with him retiring Polokov.
And then he went after Luba; we know that because she managed to get hold of Garland and he sent
out someone to capture the bounty hunter and take him to the Mission Street building. See, Luba
called us after Garland's agent picked up the bounty hunter. She was sure it would be okay; she was
sure that Garland would la him." She added, "But evidently something went wrong on Mission. We
don't know what. Maybe we never will."
Pris asked, "Does this bounty hunter have our names?"
"Oh yes, dear, I suppose he does," Irmgard said. "But he doesn't know where we are. Roy and I
aren't going back to our apartment; we have as much stuff in our car as we could cram in, and we've
decided to take one of these abandoned apartments in this ratty old building."
"Is that wise?" Isidore spoke up, summoning courage. "T-t-to all be in one place?"
"Well, they got everybody else," Irmgard said, matter-of-factly; she, too, like her husband,
seemed strangely resigned, despite her superficial agitation. All of them, Isidore thought; they're all
strange. He sensed it without being able to finger it. As if a peculiar and malign abstractness

71

pervaded their mental processes. Except, perhaps, for Pris; certainly she was radically frightened.
Pris seemed almost right, almost natural. But "Why don't you move in with him?" Roy said to Pris, indicating Isidore. "He could give you a
certain amount of protection."
"A chickenhead?" Pris said. "I'm not going to live with a chickenhead." Her nostrils flared.
Irmgard said rapidly, "I think you're foolish to be a snob at a time like this. Bounty hunters move
fast; he may try to tie it up this evening. There may be a bonus in it for him if he got it done by - "
"Keerist, close the hall door," Roy said, going over to it; he slammed it with one blow of his hand,
thereupon summarily locking it. "I think you should move in with Isidore, Pris, and I think Irm and I
should be here in the same building; that way we can help each other. I've got some electronic
components in my car, junk I ripped off the ship. I'll install a two-way bug so Pris you can hear us
and we can hear you, and I'll rig up an alarm system that any of the four of us can set off. It's obvious
that the synthetic identities didn't work out, even Garland's. Of course, Garland put his head in the
noose by bringing the bounty hunter to the Mission Street building; that was a mistake. And Polokov,
instead of staying as far away as possible from the hunter, chose to approach him. We won't do that;
we'll stay put." He did not sound worried in the slightest; the situation seemed to rouse him to
crackling near-manic energy. "I think - " He sucked in his breath noisily, holding the attention of
everyone else in the room, including Isidore. "I think that there's a reason why the three of us are still
alive. I think if he had any clue as to where we are he'd have shown up here by now. The whole idea
in bounty hunting is to work as fast as hell. That's where the profit comes."
"And if he waits," Irmgard said in agreement, "we slip away, like we've done. I bet Roy is right; I
bet he has our names but no location. Poor Luba; stuck in the War Memorial Opera House, right out
in the open. No difficulty finding her."
"Well," Roy said stiltedly, "she wanted it that way; she believed she'd be safer as a public figure."
"You told her otherwise," Irmgard said.
"Yes," Roy agreed, "I told her, and I told Polokov not to try to pass himself off as a W.P.O. man.
And I told Garland that one of his own bounty hunters would get him, which is very possibly, just
conceivably, exactly what did happen." He rocked back and forth on his heavy heels, his face wise
with profundity.
Isidore spoke up. "I-I-I gather from l-l-listening to Mr. Baty that he's your n-n-natural leader."
"Oh yes, Roy's a leader," Irmgard said.
Pris said, "He organized our trip. From Mars to here."
"Then," Isidore said, "you better do what h-h-he suggests." His voice broke with hope and
tension. "I think it would be t-t-terrific, Pris, if you 1-l-lived with me. I'll stay home a couple of days
from my job - I have a vacation coming. To make sure you're okay." And maybe Milt, who was
very inventive, could design a weapon for him to use. Something imaginative, which would slay
bounty hunters . . . whatever they were. He had an indistinct, glimpsed darkly impression: of
something merciless that carried a printed list and a gun, that moved machine-like through the flat,
bureaucratic job of killing. A thing without emotions, or even a face; a thing that if killed got replaced
immediately by another resembling it. And so on, until everyone real and alive had been shot.
Incredible, he thought, that the police can't do anything. I can't believe that. These people must
have done something. Perhaps they emigrated back to Earth illegally. We're told - the TV tells us to report any landing of a ship outside the approved pads. The police must be watching for this.
But even so, no one got killed deliberately any more. It ran contrary to Mercerism.
"The chickenhead," Pris said, "likes me."

72

"Don't call him that, Pris," Irmgard said; she gave Isidore a look of compassion. "Think what he
could call you."
Pris said nothing. Her expression became enigmatic.
"I'll go start rigging up the bug," Roy said. "Irmgard and I'll stay in this apartment; Pris you go with
- Mr. Isidore." He started toward the door, striding with amazing speed for a man so heavy. In a blur
he disappeared out the door, which banged back as he flung it open. Isidore, then, had a
momentary, strange hallucination; he saw briefly a frame of metal, a platform of pullies and circuits
and batteries and turrets and gears - and then the slovenly shape of Roy Baty faded back into view.
Isidore felt a laugh rise up inside him; he nervously choked it off. And felt bewildered.
"A man, " Pris said distantly, "of action. Too bad he's so poor with his hands, doing mechanical
things."
"If we get saved," Irmgard said in a scolding, severe tone, as if chiding her, "it'll be because of
Roy."
"But is it worth it," Pris said, mostly to herself. She shrugged, then nodded to Isidore. "Okay, J .R.
I'll move in with you and you can protect me."
"A-a-all of you," Isidore said immediately.
Solemnly, in a formal little voice, Irmgard Baty said to him, "I want you to know we appreciate it
very much, Mr. Isidore. You're the first friend I think any of us have found here on Earth. It's very
nice of you and maybe sometime we can repay you." She glided over to pat him on the arm.
"Do you have any pre-colonial fiction I could read?" he asked her.
"Pardon?" Irmgard Baty glanced inquiringly at Pris.
"Those old magazines," Pris said; she had gathered a few things together to take with her, and
Isidore lifted the bundle from her arms, feeling the glow that comes only from satisfaction at a goal
achieved. "No, J.R. We didn't bring any back with us, for reasons I explained."
"I'll g-g-go to a library tomorrow," he said, going out into the hall. "And g-get you and me too
some to read, so you'll have something to do besides just waiting."
He led Pris upstairs to his own apartment, dark and empty and stuffy and lukewarm as it was;
carrying her possessions into the bedroom, he at once turned on the heater, lights, and the TV to its
sole channel.
"I like this," Pris said, but in the same detached and remote tone - as before. She meandered
about, hands thrust in her skirt pockets; on her face a sour expression, almost righteous in the degree
of its displeasure, appeared. In contrast to her stated reaction.
"What's the matter?" he asked as he laid her possessions out on the couch.
"Nothing." She halted at the picture window, drew the drapes back, and gazed morosely out.
"If you think they're looking for you - " he began.
"It's a dream," Pris said. "Induced by drugs that Roy gave me."
"P-pardon?"
"You really think that bounty hunters exist?"
"Mr. Baty said they killed your friends."
"Roy Baty is as crazy as I am," Pris said. "Our trip was between a mental hospital on the East
Coast and here. We're all schizophrenic, with defective emotional lives - flattening of affect, it's
called. And we have group hallucinations."
'I didn't think it was true," he said full of relief.
'Why didn't you?" She swiveled to stare intently at him; her scrutiny was so strict that he felt
himself flushing.

73

"B-b-because things like that don't happen. The g-government never kills anyone, for any crime.
And Mercerism - "
"But you see," Pris said, "if you're not human, then it's all different."
"That's not true. Even animals - even eels and gophers and snakes and spiders - are sacred."
Pris, still regarding him fixedly, said, "So it can't be, can it? As you say, even animals are protected
by law. All life. Everything organic that wriggles or squirms or burrows or flies or swarms or lays
eggs or - " She broke off, because Roy Baty had appeared, abruptly throwing the door of the
apartment open and entering; a trail of wire rustled after him.
"Insects," he said, showing no embarrassment at overhearing them, "are especially sacrosanct."
Lifting a picture rom the wall of the living room he attached a small electronic device to the nail,
stepped back, viewed it, then replaced the picture. "Now the alarm." He gathered up the trailing
wire, which led to a complex assembly. Smiling his discordant smile, he showed the assembly to Pris
and John Isidore. "The alarm. These wires go under the carpet; they're antennae. It picks up the
presence of a - " He hesitated. "A mentational entity," he said obscurely, "which isn't one of us four."
"So it rings," Pris said, "and then what? He'll have a gun. We can't fall on him and bite him to
death."
"This assembly," Roy continued, "has a Penfield unit built into it. When the alarm has been
triggered it radiates a mood of panic to the - intruder. Unless he acts very fast, which he may.
Enormous panic; I have the gain turned all the way up. No human being can remain in the vicinity
more than a matter of seconds. That's the nature of panic: it leads to random circus-motions,
purposeless flight, and muscle and neural spasms." He concluded, "Which will give us an opportunity
to get him. Possibly. Depending on how good he is."
Isidore said, "Won't the alarm affect us?"
"That's right," Pris said to Roy Baty. "It'll affect Isidore."
"Well, so what," Roy said. And resumed his task of installation. "So they both go racing out of
here panic-stricken. It'll still give us time to react. And they won't kill Isidore; he's not on their list.
That's why he's usable as a cover."
Pris said brusquely, "You can't do any better, Roy?"
"No," he answered, "I can't."
"I'll be able to g-g-get a weapon tomorrow," Isidore spoke up.
"You're sure Isidore's presence here won't set off the alarm?" Pris said. "After all, he's - you
know."
"I've compensated for his cephalic emanations," Roy explained. "Their sum won't trip anything; it'll
take an additional human. Person." Scowling, he glanced at Isidore, aware of what he had said.
"You're androids," Isidore said. But he didn't care; it made no difference to him. "I see why they
want to kill you," he said. "Actually you're not alive." Everything made sense to him, now. The bounty
hunter, the killing of their friends, the trip to Earth, all these precautions.
"When I used the word 'human,"' Roy Baty said to Pris, "I used the wrong word."
"That's right, Mr. Baty," Isidore said. "But what does it matter to me? I mean, I'm a special; they
don't treat me very well either, like for instance I can't emigrate." He found himself yabbering away
like a folletto. "You can't come here; I can't - " He calmed himself.
After a pause Roy Baty said laconically, "You wouldn't enjoy Mars. You're missing nothing."
"I wondered how long it would be," Pris said to Isidore, "before you realized. We are different,
aren't we?
"That's what probably tripped up Garland and Max Polokov," Roy Baty said. "They were so
goddamn sure they could pass. Luba, too."

74

"You're intellectual," Isidore said; he felt excited again at having understood. Excitement and pride.
"You think abstractly, and you don't - " He gesticulated, his words tangling up with one another. As
usual. "I wish I had an IQ like you have; then I could pass the test, I wouldn't be a chickenhead. I
think you're very superior; I could learn a lot from you."
After an interval Roy Baty said, "I'll finish wiring up the alarm." He resumed work.
"He doesn't understand yet," Pris said in a sharp, brittle, stentorian voice, "how we got off Mars.
What we did there."
"What we couldn't help doing," Roy Baty grunted.
At the open door to the hall Irmgard Baty had been standing; they noticed her as she spoke up. "I
don't think we have to worry about Mr. Isidore," she said earnestly; she walked swiftly toward him,
looked up into his face. "They don't treat him very well either, as he said. And what we did on Mars
he isn't interested in; he knows us and he likes us and an emotional acceptance like that - it's
everything to him. It's hard for us to grasp that, but it's true." To Isidore she said, standing very close
to him once again and peering up at him, "You could get a lot of money by turning us in; do you
realize that?" Twisting, she said to her husband, "See, he realizes that but still he wouldn't say
anything."
"You're a great man, Isidore," Pris said. "You're a credit to your race."
"If he was an android," Roy said heartily, "he'd turn us in about ten tomorrow morning. He'd take
off for his job and that would be it. I'm overwhelmed with admiration." His tone could not be
deciphered; at least Isidore could not crack it. "And we imagined this would be a friendless world, a
planet of hostile faces, all turned against us." He barked out a laugh.
I'm not at all worried," Irmgard said.
'You ought to be seared to the soles of your feet," Roy said.
"Let's vote," Pris said. "As we did on the ship, when we had a disagreement."
"Well," Irmgard said, "I won't say anything more. But if we turn this down I don't think we'll find
any other human being who'll take us in and help us. Mr. Isidore is - " She searched for the word.
"Special," Pris said.

75

FIFTEEN
Solemnly, and with ceremony, the vote was taken.
"We stay here," Irmgard said, with firmness. "In this apartment, in this building."
Roy Baty said, "I vote we kill Mr. Isidore and hide somewhere else." He and his wife - and John
Isidore - now turned tautly toward Pris.
In a low voice Pris said, "I vote we make our stand here." She added, more loudly, "I think J.R.'s
value to us outweighs his danger, that of his knowing. Obviously we can't live among humans without
being discovered; that's what killed Polokov and Garland and Luba and Anders. That's what killed
all of them."
"Maybe they did just what we're doing," Roy Baty said. "Confided in, trusted, one given human
being who they believed was different. As you said, special."
"We don't know that," Irmgard said. "That's only a conjecture. I think they, they - " She gestured.
"Walked around. Sang from a stage like Luba. We trust - I'll tell you what we trust that fouls us up,
Roy; it's our goddamn superior intelligence!" She glared at her husband, her small, high breasts rising
and falling rapidly. "We're so smart - Roy, you're doing it right now; goddamn you, you're doing it
now!"
Pris said, "I think Irm's right."
"So we hang our lives on a substandard, blighted - " Roy began, then gave up. "I'm tired," he said
simply. "It's been a long trip, Isidore. But not very long here. Unfortunately."
"I hope," Isidore said happily, "I can help make your stay here on Earth pleasant." He felt sure he
could. It seemed to him a cinch, the culmination of his whole life - and of the new authority which he
had manifested on the vidphone today at work.
As soon as he officially quit work that evening, Rick Deckard flew across town to animal row: the
several blocks of big-time animal dealers with their huge glass windows and lurid signs. The new and
horribly unique depression which had floored him earlier in the day had not left. This, his activity here
with animals and animal dealers, seemed the only weak spot in the shroud of depression, a flaw by
which he might be able to grab it and exorcise it. In the past, anyhow, the sight of animals, the scent
of money deals with expensive stakes, had done much for him. Maybe it would accomplish as much
now.
"Yes, sit," a nattily dressed new animal salesman said to him chattily as he stood gaping with a sort
of glazed, meek need at the displays. "See anything you like?"
Rick said, "I see a lot I like. It's the cost that bothers me."
"You tell us the deal you want to make," the salesman said. "What you want to take home with
you and how you want to pay for it. We'll take the package to our sales manager and get his big
okay."
"I've got three thou cash." The department, at the end of the day, had paid him his bounty. "How
much," he asked, "is that family of rabbits over there?"
"Sir, if you have a down payment of three thou, I can make you owner of something a lot better
than a pair of rabbits. What about a goat?"
"I haven't thought much about goats," Rick said.
"May I ask if this represents a new price bracket for you?"
"Well, I don't usually carry around three thou," Rick conceded.

76

"I thought as much, sit, when you mentioned rabbits. The thing about rabbits, sit, is that everybody
has one. I'd like to see you step up to the goat-class where I feel you belong. Frankly you look more
like a goat man to me."
"What are the advantages to goats?"
The animal salesman said, "The distinct advantage of a goat is that it can be taught to butt anyone
who tries to steal it."
"Not if they shoot it with a hypno-dart and descend by rope ladder from a hovering hovercar,"
Rick said.
The salesman, undaunted, continued, "A goat is loyal. And it has a free, natural soul which no cage
can chain up. And there is one exceptional additional feature about goats, one which you may not be
aware of. Often times when you invest in an animal and take it home you find, some morning, that it's
eaten something radioactive and died. A goat isn't bothered by contaminated quasi-foodstuffs; it can
eat eclectically, even items that would fell a cow or a horse or most especially a cat. As a long term
investment we feel that the goat - especially the female - offers unbeatable advantages to the serious
animal-owner."
"Is this goat a female?" He had noticed a big black goat standing squarely in the center of its cage;
he moved that way and the salesman accompanied him. The goat, it seemed to Rick, was beautiful.
"Yes, this goat is a female. A black Nubian goat, very large, as you can see. This is a superb
contender in this year's market, sir. And we're offering her at an attractive, unusually low, low price."
Getting out his creased Sidney's, Rick looked up the listing, on goats, black Nubian.
"Will this be a cash deal?" the salesman asked. "Or are you trading in a used animal?"
"All cash," Rick said.
On a slip of paper the salesman scribbled a price and then briefly, almost furtively, showed it to
Rick.
" - too much," Rick said, He took the slip of paper and wrote down a more modest figure.
"We couldn't let a goat go for that," the salesman protested. He wrote another figure. "This goat is
less than a year old; she has a very long life expectancy." He showed the figure to Rick.
"It's a deal," Rick said.
He signed the time-payment contract, paid over his three thousand dollars - his entire bounty
money - as down payment, and shortly found himself standing by his hovercar, rather dazed, as
employees of the animal dealer loaded the crate of goat into the car. I own an animal now, he said to
himself. A living animal, not electric. For the second time in my life.
The expense, the contractual indebtedness, appalled him; he found himself shaking. But I had to
do it, he said to himself. The experience with Phil Resch - I have to get my confidence, my faith in
myself and my abilities, back. Or I won't keep my job.
His hands numb he guided the hovercar up into the sky and headed for his apartment and Iran.
She'll be angry, he said to himself. Because it'll worry her, the responsibility. And since she's home all
day a lot of the maintenance will fall to her. Again he felt dismal.
When he had landed on the roof of his building he sat for a time, weaving together in his mind a
story thick with verisimilitude. My job requires it, he thought, scraping bottom. Prestige. We couldn't
go on with the electric sheep any longer; it sapped my morale. Maybe I can tell her that, he decided.
Climbing from the car he maneuvered the goat cage from the back seat, with wheezing effort
managed to set it down on the roof. The goat, which had slid about during the transfer, regarded him
with bright-eyed perspicacity, but made no sound.
He descended to his floor, followed a familiar path down the hall to his own door.
"Hi," Iran greeted him, busy in the kitchen with dinner. "Why so late tonight?"

77

"Come up to the roof," he said. "I want to show you something."
"You bought an animal." She removed her apron, smoothed back her hair reflexively, and
followed him out of the apartment; they progressed down the hall with huge, eager strides. "You
shouldn't have gotten it without me," Iran gasped. "I have a right to participate in the decision, the
most important acquisition we'll ever - "
"I wanted it to be a surprise," he said.
"You made some bounty money today," Iran said, accusingly.
Rick said, "Yes. I retired three andys." He entered the elevator and together they moved nearer to
god. "I had to buy this," he said. "Something went wrong, today; something about retiring them. It
wouldn't have been possible for me to go on without getting an animal." The elevator had reached the
roof; he led his wife out into the evening darkness, to the cage; switching on the spotlights maintained for the use of all building residents - he pointed to the goat, silently. Waiting for her
reaction.
"Oh my god," Iran said softly. She walked to the cage, peered in; then she circled around it,
viewing the goat from every angle. "Is it really real?" she asked. "It's not false?"
"Absolutely real," he said. "Unless they swindled me." But that rarely happened; the fine for
counterfeiting would be enormous:
two and a half times the full market value of the genuine
animal. "No, they didn't swindle me."
"It's a goat," Iran said. "A black Nubian goat." "Female," Rick said. "So maybe later on we can
mate her. And we'll get milk out of which we can make cheese."
"Can we let her out? Put her where the sheep is?"
"She ought to be tethered," he said. "For a few days at least."
Iran said in an odd little voice, "'My life is love and pleasure.' An old, old song by Josef Strauss.
Remember? When we first met." She put her hand gently on his shoulder, leaned toward him, and
kissed him. "Much love. And very much pleasure."
"Thanks," he said, and hugged her.
"Let's run downstairs and give thanks to Mercer. Then we can come up here again and right away
name her; she needs a name. And maybe you can find some rope to tether her." She started off.
Standing by his horse Judy, grooming and currying her, their neighbor Bill Barbour called to them,
"Hey, that's a nice-looking goat you have, Deckards. Congratulations. Evening, Mrs. Deckard.
Maybe you'll have kids; I'll maybe trade you my colt for a couple of kids."
"Thanks," Rick said. He followed after Iran, in the direction of the elevator. "Does this cure your
depression?" he asked her. "It cures mine."
Iran said, "It certainly does cure my depression. Now we can admit to everybody that the sheep's
false."
"No need to do that," he said cautiously.
"But we can," Iran persisted. "See, now we have nothing to hide; what we've always wanted has
come true. It's a dream!" Once more she stood on tiptoe, leaning and nimbly kissing him; her breath,
eager and erratic, tickled his neck. She reached, then, to stab at the elevator button.
Something warned him. Something made him say, "Let's not go down to the apartment yet. Let's
stay up here with the goat. Let's just sit and look at her and maybe feed the goat something. They
gave me a bag of oats to start us out. And we can read the manual on goat maintenance; they
included that, too, at no extra charge. We can call her Euphemia." The elevator, however, had come
and already Iran was trotting inside. "Iran, wait," he said.
"It would be immoral not to fuse with Mercer in gratitude," Iran said. "I had hold of the handles of
the box today and it overcame my depression a little - just a little, not like this. But anyhow I got hit

78

by a rock, here." She held up her wrist; on it he made out a small dark bruise. "And I remember
thinking how much better we are, how much better off, when we're with Mercer. Despite the pain.
Physical pain but spiritually together; I felt everyone else, all over the world, all who had fused at the
same time." She held the elevator door from sliding shut. "Get in, Rick. This'll be just for a moment.
You hardly ever undergo fusion; I want you to transmit the mood you're in now to everyone else;
you owe it to them. It would be immoral to keep it for ourselves."
She, was, of course, right. So he entered the elevator and once again descended.
In their living room, at the empathy box, Iran swiftly snapped the switch, her face animated with
growing gladness; it lit her up like a rising new crescent of moon. "I want everyone to know," she
told him. "Once that happened to me; I fused and picked up someone who had just acquired an
animal. And then one day - " Her features momentarily darkened; the pleasure fled. "One day I
found myself receiving from someone whose animal had died. But others of us shared our different
joys with them - I didn't have any, as you might know - and that cheered the person up. We might
even reach a potential suicide; what we have, what we're feeling, might - "
"They'll have our joy," Rick said, "but we'll lose. We'll exchange what we feel for what they feel.
Our joy will be lost."
The screen of the empathy box now showed rushing streams of bright formless color; taking a
breath his wife hung on tightly to the two handles. "We won't really lose what we feel, not if we keep
it clearly in mind. You never really have gotten the hang of fusion, have you, Rick?"
"Guess not," he said. But now he had begun to sense, for the first time, the value that people such
as Iran obtained from Mercerism. Possibly his experience with the bounty hunter Phil Resch had
altered some minute synapsis in him, had closed one neurological switch and opened another. And
this perhaps had started a chain reaction. "Iran," he said urgently; he drew her away from the
empathy box. "Listen; I want to talk about what happened to me today." He led her over to the
couch, sat her down facing him. "I met another bounty hunter," he said. "One I never saw before. A
predatory one who seemed to like to destroy them. For the first time, after being with him, I looked
at them differently. I mean, in my own way I had been viewing them as he did."
"Won't this wait?" Iran said.
Rick said, "I took a test, one question, and verified it; I've begun to empathize with androids, and
look what that means. You said it this morning yourself. 'Those poor andys.' So you know what I'm
talking about. That's why I bought the goat. I never felt like that before. Maybe it could be a
depression, like you get. I can understand now how you suffer when you're depressed; I always
thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time, if not alone then by
means of the mood organ. But when you get that depressed you don't care. Apathy, because you've
lost a sense of worth. It doesn't matter whether you feet better because if you have no worth - "
"What about your job?" Her tone jabbed at him; he blinked. "Your job," Iran repeated. "What are
the monthly payments on the goat?" She held out her hand; reflexively he got out the contract which
he had signed, passed it to her.
"That much," she said in a thin voice. "The interest; good god - the interest alone. And you did this
because you were depressed. Not as a surprise for me, as you originally said." She handed the
contract back to him. "Well, it doesn't matter. I'm still glad you got the goat; I love the goat. But it's
such an economic burden." She looked gray.
Rick said, "I can get switched to some other desk. The department does ten or eleven separate
jobs. Animal theft; I could transfer to that."
"But the bounty money. We need it or they'll repossess the goat! "

79

"I'll get the contract extended from thirty-six months to forty-eight." He whipped out a ball-point
pen, scribbled rapidly on the back of the contract. "That way it'll be fifty-two fifty less a month."
The vidphone rang.
"If we hadn't come back down here," Rick said, "if we'd stayed up on the roof, with the goat, we
wouldn't have gotten this call."
Going to the vidphone, Iran said, "Why are you afraid? They're not repossessing the goat, not
yet." She started to lift the receiver.
"It's the department," he said. "Say I'm not here." He headed for the bedroom.
"Hello," Iran said, into the receiver.
Three more andys, Rick thought to himself, that I should have followed up on today, instead of
coming home. On the vidscreen Harry Bryant's face had formed, so it was too late to get away. He
walked, with stiff leg muscles, back toward the phone.
"Yes, he's here," Iran was saying. "We bought a goat. Come over and see it, Mr. Bryant." A
pause as she listened and then she held the receiver up to Rick. "He has something he wants to say
to you," she said. Going over to the empathy box she quickly seated herself and once more gripped
the twin handles. She became involved almost at once. Rick stood holding the phone receiver,
conscious of her mental departure. Conscious of his own aloneness.
"Hello," he said into the receiver.
"We have a tail on two of the remaining androids," Harry Bryant said. He was calling from his
office; Rick saw the familiar desk, the litter of documents and papers and kipple. "Obviously they've
become alerted - they've left the address Dave gave you and now they can be found at . . . wait."
Bryant groped about on his desk, at last located the material he wanted.
Automatically Rick searched for his pen; he held the goat-payment contract on his knee and
prepared to write.
"Conapt Building 3967-C," Inspector Bryant said. "Get over there as soon as you can. We have
to assume they know about the ones you picked off, Garland and Luft and Polokov; that's why
they've taken unlawful flight."
"Unlawful," Rick repeated. To save their lives.
"Iran says you bought a goat," Bryant said. "Just today? After you left work?
"On my way home."
"I'll come and look at your goat after you retire the remaining androids. By the way - I talked to
Dave just now. I told him the trouble they gave you; he says congratulations and be more careful. He
says the Nexus-6 types are smarter than he thought. In fact he couldn't believe you got three in one
day."
"Three is enough," Rick said. "I can't do anything more. I have to rest."
"By tomorrow they'll be gone," Inspector Bryant said. "Out of our jurisdiction."
"Not that soon. They'll still be around."
Bryant said, "You get over there tonight. Before they get dug in. They won't expect you to move
in so fast."
"Sure they will," Rick said. "They'll be waiting for me."
"Got the shakes? Because of what, Polokov - "
"I haven't got the shakes," Rick said.
"Then what's wrong?
"Okay," Rick said. "I'll get over there." He started to hang up the phone.
"Let me know as soon as you get results. I'll be here in my office."
Rick said, "If I get them I'm going to buy a sheep."

80

"You have a sheep. You've had one as long as I've known you."
"It's electric," Rick said. He hung up. A real sheep this time, he said to himself. I have to get one.
In compensation.
At the black empathy box his wife crouched, her face rapt. He stood beside her for a time, his
hand resting on her breast; he felt it rise and fall, the life in her, the activity. Iran did not notice him;
the experience with Mercer had, as always, become complete.
On the screen the faint, old, robed figure of Mercer toiled upward, and all at once a rock sailed
past him. Watching, Rick thought, My god; there's something worse about my situation than his.
Mercer doesn't have to do anything alien to him. He suffers but at least he isn't required to violate his
own identity.
Bending, he gently removed his wife's fingers from the twin handles. He then himself took her
place. For the first time in weeks. An impulse: he hadn't planned it; all at once it had happened.
A landscape of weeds confronted him, a desolation. The air smelled of harsh blossoms; this was
the desert, and there was no rain.
A man stood before him, a sorrowful light in his weary, pain-drenched eyes.
"Mercer," Rick said.
"I am your friend," the old man said. "But you must go on as if I did not exist. Can you understand
that?" He spread empty hands.
"No," Rick said. "I can't understand that. I need help."
"How can I save you," the old man said, "if I can't save myself?" He smiled. "Don't you see? There
is no salvation."
"Then what's this for?" Rick demanded. "What are you for?"
"To show you," Wilbur Mercer said, "that you aren't alone. I am here with you and always will be.
Go and do your task, even though you know it's wrong."
"Why?" Rick said. "Why should I do it? I'll quit my job and emigrate."
The old man said, "You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic
condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives
must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that
feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe."
"That's all you can tell me?" Rick said.
A rock whizzed at him; he ducked and the rock struck him on the ear. At once he let go of the
handles and again he stood in his own living room, beside his wife and the empathy box. His head
ached wildly from the blow; reaching, he found fresh blood collecting, spilling in huge bright drops
down the side of his face.
Iran, with a handkerchief, patted his ear. "I guess I'm glad you pried me loose. I really can't stand
it, being hit. Thanks for taking the rock in my place."
"I'm going," Rick said.
"The job?"
"Three jobs." He took the handkerchief from her and went to the hall door, still dizzy and, now,
feeling nausea.
"Good luck," Iran said.
"I didn't get anything from holding onto those handles," Rick said. "Mercer talked to me but it
didn't help. He doesn't know any more than I do. He's just an old man climbing a hill to his death."
"Isn't that the revelation?"
Rick said, "I have that revelation already." He opened the hall door. "I'll see you later." Stepping
out into the hall he shut the door after him. Conapt 3967-C, he reflected, reading it off the back of

81

the contract. That's out in the suburbs; it's mostly abandoned, there. A good place to hide. Except :
or the lights at night. That's what I'll be going by, he thought. The lights. Phototropic, like the death's
head moth. And then after this, he thought, there won't be any more. I'll do something else, earn my
living another way. These three are the last. Mercer is right; I have to get this over with. But, he
thought, I don't think I can. Two andys together - this isn't a moral question, it's a practical question.
I probably can't retire them, he realized. Even if I try; I'm too tired and too much has happened
today. Maybe Mercer knew this, he reflected. Maybe he foresaw everything that will happen.
But I know where I can get help, offered to me before but declined.
He reached the roof and a moment later sat in the darkness of his hovercar, dialing.
"Rosen Association," the answering-service girl said.
"Rachael Rosen," he said.
"Pardon, sir?"
Rick grated, "Get me Rachael Rosen."
"Is Miss Rosen expecting - "
"I'm sure she is," he said. He waited.
Ten minutes later Rachael Rosen's small dark face appeared on the vidscreen. "Hello, Mr.
Deckard."
"Are you busy right now or can I talk to you?" he said. "As you said earlier today." It did not seem
like today; a generation had risen and declined since he had talked to her last. And all the weight, all
the weariness of it, had recapitulated itself in his body; he felt the physical burden. Perhaps, he
thought, because of the rock. With the handkerchief he dabbed at his still-bleeding ear,
"Your ear is cut," Rachael said. "What a shame."
Rick said, "Did you really think I wouldn't call you? As you said?"
"I told you," Rachael said, "that without me one of the Nexus-6s would get you before you got it."
"You were wrong."
"But you are calling. Anyhow. Do you want me to come down there to San Francisco?"
"Tonight," he said.
"Oh, it's too late. I'll come tomorrow; it's an hour trip."
"I have been told I have to get them tonight." He paused and then said, "Out of the original eight,
three are left."
"You sound like you've had a just awful time."
"If you don't fly down here tonight," he said, "I'll go after them alone and I won't be able to retire
them. I just bought a goat," he added. "With the bounty money from the three I did get."
"You humans." Rachael laughed. "Goats smell terrible."
"Only male goats. I read it in the book of instructions that came with it."
"You really are tired," Rachael said. "You look dazed. Are you sure you know what you're doing,
trying for three more Nexus-6s the same day? No one has ever retired six androids in one day."
"Franklin Powers," Rick said. "About a year ago, in Chicago. He retired seven."
"The obsolete McMillan Y-4 variety," Rachael said. "This is something else." She pondered.
"Rick, I can't do it. I haven't even had dinner."
"I need you," he said. Otherwise I'm going to die, he said to himself. I know it; Mercer knew it; I
think you know it, too. And I'm wasting my time appealing to you, he reflected. An android can't be
appealed to; there's nothing in there to reach.
Rachael said, "I'm sorry, Rick, but I can't do it tonight. It'll have to be tomorrow."
"Android vengeance," Rick said.
"What?"

82

"Because I tripped you up on the Voigt-Kampff scale."
"Do you think that?" Wide-eyed, she said, "Really?"
"Good-by," he said, and started to hang up.
"Listen," Rachael said rapidly. "You're not using your head."
"It seems that way to you because you Nexus-6 types are cleverer than humans."
"No, I really don't understand," Rachael sighed. "I can tell that you don't want to do this job
tonight - maybe not at all. Are you sure you want me to make it possible for you to retire the three
remaining androids? Or do you want me to persuade you not to try?"
"Come down here," he said, "and we'll rent a hotel room."
"Why? "
"Something I heard today," he said hoarsely. "About situations involving human men and android
women. Come down here to San Francisco tonight and I'll give up on the remaining andys. We'll do
something else."
She eyed him, then abruptly said, "Okay, I'll fly down. Where should I meet you?"
"At the St. Francis. It's the only halfway decent hotel still in operation in the Bay Area."
"And you won't do anything until I get there."
"I'll sit in the hotel room," he said, "and watch Buster Friendly on TV. His guest for the last three
days has been Amanda Werner. I like her; I could watch her the rest of my life. She has breasts that
smile." He hung up, then, and sat for a time, his mind vacant. At last the cold of the car roused him;
he switched on the ignition key and a moment later headed in the direction of downtown San
Francisco. And the St. Francis Hotel.

83

SIXTEEN
In the sumptuous and enormous hotel room Rick Deckard sat reading the typed carbon sheets on
the two androids Roy and Irmgard Baty. In these two cases telescopic snapshots had been included,
fuzzy 3-D color prints which he could barely make out. The woman, he decided, looks attractive.
Roy Baty, however, is something different. Something worse.
A pharmacist on Mars, he read. Or at least the android had made use of that cover. In actuality it
had probably been a manual laborer, a field hand, with aspirations for something better. Do androids
dream? Rick asked himself. Evidently; that's why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here.
A better life, without servitude. Like Luba Luft; singing Don Giovanni and Le Nozze instead of toiling
across the face of a barren rock-strewn field. On a fundamentally uninhabitable colony world.
Roy Baty (the poop sheet informed him) has an aggressive, assertive air of ersatz authority.
Given to mystical preoccupations, this android proposed the group escape attempt,
underwriting it ideologically with a pretentious fiction as to the sacredness of so-called android
"life." In addition, this android stole, and experimented with, various mind-fusing drugs,
claiming when caught that it hoped to promote in androids a group experience similar to that of
Mercerism, which it pointed out remains unavailable to androids.
The account had a pathetic quality. A rough, cold android, hoping to undergo an experience from
which, due to a deliberately built-in defect, it remained excluded. But he could not work up much
concern for Roy Baty; he caught, from Dave's jottings, a repellent quality hanging about this
particular android. Baty had tried to force the fusion experience into existence for itself - and then,
when that fell through, it had engineered the killing of a variety of human beings . . . followed by the
flight to Earth. And now, especially as of today, the chipping away of the original eight androids until
only the three remained. And they, the outstanding members of the illegal group, were also doomed,
since if he failed to get them someone else would. Time and tide, he thought. The cycle of life. Ending
in this, the last twilight. Before the silence of death. He perceived in this a micro-universe, complete.
The door of the hotel room banged open. "What a flight," Rachael Rosen said breathlessly,
entering in a long fish-scale coat with matching bra and shorts; she carried, besides her big, ornate,
mail-pouch purse, a paper bag. "This is a nice room." She examined her wristwatch. "Less than an
hour - I made good time. Here." She held out the paper bag. "I bought a bottle. Bourbon."
Rick said, "The worst of the eight is still alive. The one who organized them." He held the poop
sheet on Roy Baty toward her; Rachael set down the paper bag and accepted the carbon sheet.
"You've located this one?" she asked, after reading.
"I have a conapt number. Out in the suburbs where possibly a couple of deteriorated specials,
antheads and chickenheads, hang out and go through their versions of living."
Rachael held out her hand. "Let's see about the others."
"Both females." He passed her the sheets, one dealing with Irmgard Baty, the other an android
calling itself Pris Stratton.
Glancing at the final sheet Rachael said, "Oh - " She tossed the sheets down, moved over to the
window of the room to look out at downtown San Francisco. "I think you're going to get thrown by
the last one. Maybe not; maybe you don't care." She had turned pale and her voice shook. All at
once she had become exceptionally unsteady.
"Exactly what are you muttering about?" He retrieved the sheets, studied them, wondering which
part had upset Rachael.

84

"Let's open the bourbon." Rachael carried the paper bag into the bathroom, got two glasses,
returned; she still seemed distracted and uncertain - and preoccupied. He sensed the rapid flight of
her hidden thoughts: the transitions showed on her frowning, tense face. "Can you get this open?" she
asked. "It's worth a fortune, you realize. It's not synthetic; it's from before the war, made from
genuine mash."
Taking the bottle he opened it, poured bourbon in the two tumblers. "Tell me what's the matter,"
he said.
Rachael said, "On the phone you told me if I flew down here tonight you'd give up on the
remaining three andys. 'We'll do something else,' you said. But here we are - "
"Tell me what upset you," he said.
Facing him defiantly, Rachael said, "Tell me what were going to do instead of fussing and fretting
around about those last three Nexus-6 andys." She unbuttoned her coat, carried it to the closet, and
hung it up. This gave him his first chance to have a good long look at her. . Rachael's proportions, he
noticed once again, were odd; with her heavy mass of dark hair her head seemed large, and because
of her diminutive breasts her body assumed a lank, almost childlike stance. But her great eyes, with
their elaborate lashes, could only be those of a grown woman; there the resemblance to adolescence
ended. Rachael rested very slightly on the fore-part of her feet, and her arms, as they hung, bent at
the joint. The stance, he reflected, of a wary hunter of perhaps the Cro-Magnon persuasion. The
race of tall hunters, he said to himself. No excess flesh, a flat belly, small behind and smaller bosom Rachael had been modeled on the Celtic type of build, anachronistic and attractive, Below the brief
shorts her legs, slender, had a neutral, nonsexual quality, not much rounded off in nubile curves. The
total impression was good, however. Although definitely that of a girl, not a woman. Except for the
restless, shrewd eyes.
He sipped the bourbon; the power of it, the authoritative strong taste and scent, had become
almost unfamiliar to him and he had trouble swallowing. Rachael, in contrast, had no difficulty with
hers.
Seating herself on the bed Rachael smoothed absently at the spread; her expression had now
become one of moodiness. He set his glass down on the bedside table and arranged himself beside
her. Under his gross weight the bed gave, and Rachael shifted her position.
"What is it?" he said. Reaching, he took hold of her hand; it felt cold, bony, slightly moist. "What
upset you?"
"That last goddamn Nexus-6 type," Rachael said, enunciating with effort, "is the same type as I
am." She stared down at the bedspread, found a thread, and began rolling it into a pellet. "Didn't you
notice the description? It's of me, too. She may wear her hair differently and dress differently - she
may even have bought a wig. But when you see her you'll know what I mean." She laughed
sardonically. "It's a good thing the association admitted I'm an andy; otherwise you'd probably have
gone mad when you caught sight of Pris Stratton. Or thought she was me."
"Why does that bother you so much?"
"Hell, I'll be along when you retire her."
"Maybe not. Maybe I won't find her.'
Rachael said, "I know Nexus-6 psychology. That's why I'm here; that's why I can help you.
They're all holed up together, the three of them. Clustered around the deranged one calling himself
Roy Baty. He'll be masterminding their crucial, all-out, final defense." Her lips twisted. "Jesus," she
said.
"Cheer up," he said; he cupped her sharp, small chin in the palm of his hand, lifted her head so that
she had to face him. I wonder what it's like to kiss an android, he said to himself. Leaning forward an

85

inch he kissed her dry lips. No reaction followed; Rachael remained impassive. As if unaffected. And
yet he sensed otherwise. Or perhaps it was wishful thinking.
"I wish," Rachael said, "that I had known that before I came. I never would have flown down
here. I think you're asking too much. You know what I have? Toward this Pris android? "
"Empathy," he said.
"Something like that. Identification; there goes I. My god; maybe that's what'll happen. In the
confusion you'll retire me, not her. And she can go back to Seattle and live my life. I never felt this
way before. We are machines, stamped out like bottle caps. It's an illusion that I - I - personary really exist; I'm just representative of a type." She shuddered.
He could not help being amused; Rachael had become so mawkishly morose. "Ants don't feel like
that," he said, "and they're physically identical."
"Ants. They don't feel period."
"Identical human twins. They don't - "
"But they identify with each other; I understand they have an empathic, special bond." Rising, she
got to the bourbon bottle, a little unsteadily; she refilled her glass and again drank swiftly. For a time
she slouched about the room, brows knitted darkly, and then, as if sliding his way by chance, she
settled back onto the bed; she swung her legs up and stretched out, leaning against the fat pillows.
And sighed. "Forget the three andys." Her voice filled with weariness. "I'm so worn out, from the trip
I guess. And from all I learned today. I just want to sleep." She shut her eyes. "If I die," she
murmured, "maybe I'll be born again when the Rosen Association stamps out its next unit of my
subtype." She opened her eyes and glared at him ferociously. "Do you know," she said, "why I really
came here? Why Eldon and the other Rosens - the human ones - wanted me to go along with you?"
"To observe," he said. "To detail exactly what the Nexus does that gives it away on the VoigtKampff test."
"On the test or otherwise. Everything that gives it a different quality. And then I report back and
the association makes modifications of its zygote-bath DNS factors. And we then have the Nexus-7.
And when that gets caught we modify it again and eventually the association has a type that can't be
distinguished."
"Do you know of the Boneli Reflex-Arc Test?" he asked.
"We're working on the spinal ganglia, too. Someday the Boneli test will fade into yesterday's
hoary shroud of spiritual oblivion." She smiled innocuously - at variance with her words. At this point
he could not discern her degree of seriousness. A topic of world-shaking importance, yet dealt with
facetiously; an android trait, possibly, he thought. No emotional awareness, no feeling-sense of the
actual meaning of what she said. Only the hollow, formal, intellectual definitions of the separate
terms.
And, more, Rachael had begun to tease him. Imperceptibly she had passed from lamenting her
condition to taunting him about his.
"Damn you," he said.
Rachael laughed. "I'm drunk. I can't go with you. If leave here - " She gestured in dismissal. "I'll
stay behind and steep and you can tell me later what happened."
"Except," he said, "there won't be a later because Roy Baty will nail me."
"But I can't help you anyhow now because I'm drunk. Anyhow, you know the truth, the brickhard, irregular, slithery surface of truth. I'm just an observer and I won't intervene to save you; I don't
care if Roy Baty nails you or not. I care whether I get nailed." She opened her eyes round and wide.
"Christ, I'm empathic about myself. And, see, if I go to that suburban broken-down conapt building " She reached out, toyed with a button of his shirt; in slow, facile twists she began unbuttoning it. "I

86

don't dare go because androids have no loyalty to one another and I know that that goddamn Pris
Stratton will destroy me and occupy my place. See? Take off your coat."
"Why?"
"So we can go to bed," Rachael said.
"I bought a black Nubian goat," he said. "I have to retire the three more andys. I have to finish up
my job and go home to my wife." He got up, walked around the bed to the bottle of bourbon.
Standing there he carefully poured himself a second drink; his hands, he observed, shook only very
slightly. Probably from fatigue. Both of us, he realized, are tired. Too tired to hunt down three andys,
with the worst of the eight calling the shots.
Standing there he realized, all at once, that he had acquired an overt, incontestable fear directed
toward the principal android. It all hung on Baty - had hung on it from the start. Up to now he had
encountered and retired progressively more ominous manifestations of Baty. Now came Baty itself.
Thinking that he felt the fear grow; it snared him completely, now that he had let it approach his
conscious mind. "I can't go without you now," he said to Rachael. "I can't even leave here. Polokov
came after me; Garland virtually came after me."
"You think Roy Baty will look you up?" Setting down her empty glass she bent forward, reached
back, and unfastened her bra. With agility she slid it from her, then stood, swaying, and grinning
because she swayed. "In my purse," she said, "I have a mechanism which our autofac on Mars builds
as an emer - " She grimaced. "An emergency safety thingamajing, -jig, while they're putting a newly
made andy through its routine inspection checks. Get it out. It resembles an oyster. You'll see it."
He began hunting through the purse. Like a human woman, Rachael had every class of object
conceivable filched and hidden away in her purse; he found himself rooting interminably.
Meanwhile, Rachael kicked off her boots and unzipped her shorts; balancing on one foot she
caught the discarded fabric with her toe and tossed it across the room. She then dropped onto the
bed, roiled over to fumble for her glass, accidently pushed the glass to the carpeted floor. "Damn,"
she said, and once again got shakily to her feet; in her underpants she stood watching him at work on
her purse, and then, with careful deliberation and attention she drew the bedcovers back, got in,
drew the covers over her.
"Is this it?" He held up a metallic sphere with a button-stem projecting.
"That cancels an android into catalepsy," Rachael said, her eyes shut. "For a few seconds.
Suspends its respiration; yours, too, but humans can function without respiring - perspiring? -for a
couple of minutes, but the vagus nerve of an andy - "
"I know." He straightened up. "The android autonomic nervous system isn't as flexible at cutting in
and out as ours. But as you say, this wouldn't work for more than five or six seconds."
"Long enough," Rachael murmured, "to save your life. So, see - " She roused herself, sat up in the
bed. "If Roy Baty shows up here you can be holding that in your hand and you can press the stem on
that thing. And while Roy Baty is frozen stiff with no air supply to his blood and his brain cells
deteriorating you can kill Roy Baty with your laser."
"You have a laser tube," he said. "In your purse."
"A fake. Androids" - she yawned, eyes again shut - "aren't permitted to carry lasers."
He walked over to the bed.
Squirming about, Rachael managed to roll over at last onto her stomach, face buried in the white
lower sheet. "This is a clean, noble, virgin type of bed," she stated. "Only clean, noble girls who - "
She pondered. "Androids can't bear children," she said, then. "Is that a loss?"
He finished undressing her. Exposed her pale, cold loins.

87

"Is it a loss?" Rachael repeated. "I don't really know; I have no way to tell. How does it feel to
have a child? How does it feel to be born, for that matter? We're not born; we don't grow up;
instead of dying from illness or old age we wear out like ants. Ants again; that's what we are. Not
you; I mean me. Chitinous reflex-machines who aren't really alive." She twisted her head to one side,
said loudly, "I'm not alive! You're not going to bed with a woman. Don't be disappointed; okay?
Have you ever made love to an android before?"
"No," he said, taking off his shirt and tie.
"I understand - they tell me - it's convincing if you don't think too much about it. But if you think
too much, if you reflect on what you're doing - then you can't go on. For ahem physiological
reasons."
Bending, he kissed her bare shoulder.
"Thanks, Rick," she said wanly. "Remember, though: don't think about it, just do it. Don't pause
and be philosophical, because from a philosophical standpoint it's dreary. For us both."
He said, "Afterward I still intend to look for Roy Baty. I still need you to be there. I know that
laser tube you have in your purse is - "
"You think I'll retire one of your andys for you;"
"I think in spite of what you said you'll help me all you can. Otherwise you wouldn't be lying there
in that bed."
"I love you," Rachael said. "If I entered a room and found a sofa covered with your hide I'd score
very high on the Voigt-Kampff test."
Tonight sometime, he thought as he clicked off the bedside light, I will retire a Nexus-6 which
looks exactly like this naked girl. My good god, he thought; I've wound up where Phil Resch said.
Go to bed with her first, he remembered. Then kill her. "I can't do it," he said, and backed away
from the bed.
"I wish you could," Rachael said. Her voice wavered.
"Not because of you. Because of Pris Stratton; what I have to do to her."
"We're not the same. I don't can about Pris Stratton. Listen." Rachael thrashed about in the bed,
sitting up; in the gloom he could dimly make out her almost breastless, trim shape. "Go to bed with
me and I'll retire Stratton. Okay? Because I can't stand getting this close and then .."
"Thank you," he said; gratitude - undoubtedly because of the bourbon - rose up inside him,
constricting his throat. Two, he thought. I now have only two to retire; just the Batys. Would Rachael
really do it? Evidently. Androids thought and functioned that way. Yet he had never come across
anything quite like this.
"Goddamn it, get into bed," Rachael said.
He got into bed.

88

SEVENTEEN
Afterward they enjoyed a great luxury: Rick had room service bring up coffee. He sat for a long
time within the arms of a green, black, and gold leaf lounge chair, sipping coffee and meditating about
the next few hours. Rachael, in the bathroom, squeaked and hummed and splashed in the midst of a
hot shower.
"You made a good deal when you made that deal," she called when she had shut off the water;
dripping, her hair tied up with a rubber band, she appeared bare and pink at the bathroom door.
"We androids can't control our physical, sensual passions. You probably knew that; in my opinion
you took advantage of me." She did not, however, appear genuinely angry. If anything she had
become cheerful and certainly as human as any girl he had known. "Do we really have to go track
down those three andys tonight?"
"Yes," he said. Two for me to retire, he thought; one for you. As Rachael put it, the deal had been
made.
Gathering a giant white bath towel about her, Rachael said, "Did you enjoy that?"
"Yes."
"Would you ever go to bed with an android again?"
"If it was a girl. If she resembled you."
Rachael said, "Do you know what the lifespan of a humanoid robot such as myself is? I've been in
existence two years. How long do you calculate I have?"
After a hesitation he said, "About two more years."
"They never could solve that problem. I mean cell replacement. Perpetual or anyhow semiperpetual renewal. Well, so it goes." Vigorously she began drying herself. Her face had become
expressionless.
"I'm sorry," Rick said.
"Hell," Rachael said, "I'm sorry I mentioned it. Anyhow it keeps humans from running off and living
with an android."
"And this is true with you Nexus-6 types too?"
"It's the metabolism. Not the brain unit." She trotted out, swept up her underpants, and began to
dress.
He, too, dressed. Then together, saying little, the two of them journeyed to the roof field, where
his hovercar had been parked by the pleasant white-clad human attendant.
As they headed toward the suburbs of San Francisco, Rachael said, "It's a nice night."
"My goat is probably asleep by now," he said. "Or maybe goats are nocturnal. Some animals
never sleep. Sheep never do, not that I could detect; whenever you look at them they're looking
back. Expecting to be fed."
"What sort of wife do you have?"
He did not answer.
"Do you - "
"If you weren't an android," Rick interrupted, "if I could legally marry you, I would."
Rachael said, "Or we could live in sin, except that I'm not alive."
"Legally you're not. But really you are. Biologically. You're not made out of transistorized circuits
like a false animal; you're an organic entity." And in two years, he thought, you'll wear out and die.
Because we never solved the problem of cell replacement, as you pointed out. So I guess it doesn't
matter anyhow.

89

This is my end, he said to himself. As a bounty hunter. After the Batys there won't be any more.
Not after this, tonight.
"You look so sad," Rachael said.
Putting his hand out he touched her cheek.
"You're not going to be able to hunt androids any longer," she said calmly. "So don't look sad.
Please."
He stared at her.
"No bounty bunter ever has gone on," Rachael said. "After being with me. Except one. A very
cynical man. Phil Resch. And he's nutty; he works out in left field on his own."
"I see," Rick said. He felt numb. Completely. Throughout his entire body.
"But this trip we're taking," Rachael said, "won't be wasted, because you're going to meet a
wonderful, spiritual man."
"Roy Baty," he said. "Do you know all of them?"
"I knew all of them, when they still existed. I know three, now. We tried to stop you this morning,
before you started out with Dave Holden's list. I tried again, just before Polokov reached you. But
then after that I had to wait."
"Until I broke down," he said. "And had to call you."
"Luba Luft and I had been close, very close friends for almost two years. What did you think of
her? Did you like her?
"I liked her."
"But you killed her."
"Phil Resch killed her."
"Oh, so Phil accompanied you back to the opera house. We didn't know that; our
communications broke down about then. We knew just that she had been killed; we naturally
assumed by you."
"From Dave's notes," he said, "I think I can still go ahead and retire Roy Baty. But maybe not
Irmgard Baty." And not Pris Stratton, he thought. Even now; even knowing this.
"So all that took place at the hotel" he said, "consisted of a - "
"The association," Rachael said, "wanted to reach the bounty hunters here and in the Soviet Union.
This seemed to work . . . for reasons which we do not fully understand. Our limitation again, I
guess."
"I doubt if it works as often or as well as you say," he said thickly.
"But it has with you."
"We'll see."
"I already know," Rachael said. "When I saw that expression on your face, that grief. I look for
that."
"How many times have you done this?"
"I don't remember. Seven, eight. No, I believe it's nine." She - or rather it - nodded. "Yes, nine
times."
"The idea is old-fashioned," Rick said.
Startled, Rachael said, "W-what?"
Pushing the steering wheel away from him he put the car into a gliding decline. "Or anyhow that's
how it strikes me. I'm going to kill you," he said. "And go on to Roy and Irmgard Baty and Pris
Stratton alone."

90

"That's why you're landing?" Apprehensively, she said, "There's a fine; I'm the property, the legal
property, of the association. I'm not an escaped android who fled here from Mars; I'm not in the
same class as the others."
"But," he said, "if I can kill you then I can kill them."
Her hands dived for her bulging, overstuffed, kipple-filled purse; she searched frantically, then
gave up. "Goddamn this purse," she said with ferocity. "I never can lay my hands on anything in it.
Will you kill me in a way that won't hurt? I mean, do it carefully. If I don't fight; okay? I promise not
to fight. Do you agree?"
Rick said, "I understand now why Phil Resch said what he said. He wasn't being cynical; he had
just learned too much. Going through this - I can't blame him. It warped him."
"But the wrong way." She seemed more externally composed, now. But still fundamentally frantic
and tense. Yet, the dark fire waned; the life force oozed out of her, as he had so often witnessed
before with other androids. The classic resignation. Mechanical, intellectual acceptance of that which
a genuine organism - with two billion years of the pressure to live and evolve hagriding it - could
never have reconciled itself to.
"I can't stand the way you androids give up," he said savagely. The car now swooped almost to
the ground; he had to jerk the wheel toward him to avoid a crash. Braking, he managed to bring the
car to a staggering, careening halt; he slammed off the motor and got out his laser tube.
"At the occipital bone, the posterior base of my skull," Rachael said. "Please." She twisted about
so that she did not have to look at the laser tube; the beam would enter unperceived.
Putting his laser tube away Rick said, "I can't do what Phil Resch said." He snapped the motor
back on, and a moment later they had taken off again.
"If you're ever going to do it," Rachael said, "do it now. Don't make me wait."
"I'm not going to kill you." He steered the car in the direction of downtown San Francisco once
again. "Your car's at the St. Francis, isn't it? I'll let you off there and you can head for Seattle." That
ended what he had to say; he drove in silence.
"Thanks for not killing me," Rachael said presently.
"Hell, as you said you've only got two years of life left, anyhow. And I've got fifty. I'll live twentyfive times as long as you."
"But you really look down on me," Rachael said. "For what I did." Assurance had returned to her;
the litany of her voice picked up pace. "You've gone the way of the others.
The bounty hunters before you. Each time they get furious and talk wildly about killing me, but
when the time comes they can't do it. Just like you, just now." She lit a cigarette, inhaled with relish.
"You realize what this means, don't you? It means I was right; you won't be able to retire any more
androids; it won't be just me, it'll be the Batys and Stratton, too. So go on home to your goat. And
get some rest." Suddenly she brushed at her coat, violently. "Yife! I got a burning ash from my
cigarette - there, it's gone." She sank back against the seat, relaxing.
He said nothing.
"That goat," Rachel said. "You love the goat more than you love your wife, probably. First the
goat, then your wife, then last of all - " She laughed merrily. "What can you do but laugh?"
He did not answer. They continued in silence for a while and then Rachael poked about, found the
car's radio, and switched it on.
"Turn it off," Rick said.
"Turn off Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends? Tum off Amanda Werner and Oscar Scruggs?
It's time to hear Buster's big sensational exposé, which is finally almost arrived." She stooped to read

91

the dial of her watch by the radio's light. "Very soon now. Did you already know about it? He's been
talking about it, building up to it, for - "
The radio said, " - ah jes wan ta tell ya, folks, that ahm sitten hih with my pal Bustuh, an we're
tawkin en haven a real mighty fine time, waitin expectantly as we ah with each tick uh the clock foh
what ah understan is the mos important announcement of - "
Rick shut the radio off. "Oscar Scruggs," he said. "The voice of intelligent man."
Instantly reaching, Rachael clicked the radio back on. "I want to listen. I intend to listen. This is
important, what Buster Friendly has to say on his show tonight."
The idiotic voice babbled once more from the speaker, and Rachael Rosen settled back and
made herself comfortable. Beside him in the darkness the coal of her cigarette glowed like the rump
of a complacent lightning bug: a steady, unwavering index of Rachael Rosen's achievement. Her
victory over him.

92

EIGHTEEN
"Bring the rest of my property up here," Pris ordered J. R. Isidore. "In particular I want the TV
set. So we can hear Buster's announcement."
"Yes," Irmgard Baty agreed, bright-eyed, like a darting, plumed swift. "We need the TV; we've
been waiting a long time for tonight and now it'll be starting soon."
Isidore said, "My own set gets the government channel."
Off in a corner of the living room, seated in a deep chair as if he intended to remain permanently,
as if he had taken up lodgings in the chair, Roy Baty belched and said patiently, "It's Buster Friendly
and his Friendly Friends that we want to watch, Iz. Or do you want me to call you J.R.? Anyhow,
do you understand? So will you go get the set?"
Alone, Isidore made his way down the echoing, empty hall to the stairs. The potent, strong
fragrance of happiness still bloomed in him, the sense of being - for the first time in his dull life useful. Others depend on me now, he exulted as he trudged down the dust-impacted steps to the
level beneath.
And, he thought, it'll be nice to see Buster Friendly on TV again, instead of just listening on the
radio in the store truck. And that's right, he realized; Buster Friendly is going to reveal his carefully
documented sensational exposé tonight. So because of Pris and Roy and Irmgard I get to watch
what will probably be the most important piece of news to be released in many years. How about
that, he said to himself.
Life, for J. R. Isidore, had definitely taken an upswing.
He entered Pris's former apartment, unplugged the TV set, and detached the antenna. The silence,
all at once, penetrated; he felt his arms grow vague. In the absence of the Batys and Pris he found
himself fading out, becoming strangely like the inert television set which he had just unplugged. You
have to be with other people, he thought. In order to live at all. I mean, before they came here I
could stand it, being alone in the building. But now it's changed. You can't go back, he thought. You
can't go from people to nonpeople. In panic he thought, I'm dependent on them. Thank god they
stayed.
It would require two trips to transfer Pris's possessions to the apartment above. Hoisting the TV
set he decided to take it first, then the suitcases and remaining clothes.
A few minutes later he had gotten the TV set upstairs; his fingers groaning he placed it on a coffee
table in his living room. The Batys and Pris watched impassively.
"We get a good signal in this building," he panted as he plugged in the cord and attached the
antenna. "When I used to get Buster Friendly and his - "
"Just turn the set on," Roy Baty said. "And stop talking. He did so, then hurried to the door. "One
more trip," he said, "will do it." He lingered, warming himself at the hearth of their presence.
"Fine," Pris said remotely.
Isidore started off once more. I think, he thought, they're exploiting me sort of. But he did not
care. They're still good friends to have, he said to himself.
Downstairs again, he gathered the girl's clothing together, stuffed every piece into the suitcases,
then labored back down the hall once again and up the stairs.
On a step ahead of him something small moved in the dust.
Instantly he dropped the suitcases; he whipped out a plastic medicine bottle, which, like everyone
else, he carried for just this. A spider, undistinguished but alive. Shakily he eased it into the bottle and
snapped the cap - perforated by means of a needle - shut tight.
Upstairs, at the door of his apartment, he paused to get his breath.

93

" - yes sir, folks; the time is now. This is Buster Friendly, who hopes and trusts you're as eager as
I am to share the discovery which I've made and by the way had verified by top trained research
workers working extra hours over the past weeks. Ho ho, folks; this is it!"
John Isidore said, "I found a spider."
The three androids glanced up, momentarily moving their attention from the TV screen to him.
"Let's see it," Pris said. She held out her hand.
Roy Baty said, "Don't talk while Buster is on."
"I've never seen a spider," Pris said. She cupped the medicine bottle in her palms, surveying the
creature within. "All those legs. Why's it need so many legs, J.R.?"
"That's the way spiders are," Isidore said, his heart pounding; he had difficulty breathing. "Eight
legs."
Rising to her feet, Pris said, "You know what I think, J.R.? I think it doesn't need all those legs."
"Eight?" Irmgard Baty said. "Why couldn't it get by on four!' Cut four off and see." Impulsively
opening her purse she produced a pair of clean, sharp cuticle scissors, which she passed to Pris.
A weird terror struck at J. R. Isidore.
Carrying the medicine bottle into the kitchen Pris seated herself at J. R. Isidore's breakfast table.
She removed the lid from the bottle and dumped the spider out. "It probably won't be able to run as
fast," she said, "but there's nothing for it to catch around here anyhow. It'll die anyway." She reached
for the scissors.
"Please," Isidore said.
Pris glanced up inquiringly. "Is it worth something ?
"Don't mutilate it," he said wheezingly. Imploringly.
With the scissors Pris snipped off one of the spider's legs.
In the living room Buster Friendly on the TV screen said, "Take a look at this enlargement of a
section of background. This is the sky you usually see. Wait, I'll have Earl Parameter, head of my
research staff, explain their virtually world-shaking discovery to you."
Pris clipped off another leg, restraining the spider with the edge of her hand. She was smiling.
"Blowups of the video pictures," a new voice from the TV said, "when subjected to rigorous
laboratory scrutiny, reveal that the gray backdrop of sky and daytime moon against which Mercer
moves is not only not Terran - it is artificial."
"You're missing it!" Irmgard called anxiously to Pris; she rushed to the kitchen door, saw what Pris
had begun doing. "Oh, do that afterward," she said coaxingly. This is so important, what they're
saying; it proves that everything we believed - "
"Be quiet," Roy Baty said.
" - is true," Irmgard finished.
The TV set continued, "The 'moon' is painted; in the enlargements, one of which you see now on
your screen, brushstrokes show. And there is even some evidence that the scraggly weeds and
dismal, sterile soil - perhaps even the stones hurled at Mercer by unseen alleged parties - are equally
faked. It is quite possible in fact that the 'stones' are made of soft plastic, causing no authentic
wounds."
"In other words," Buster Friendly broke in, "Wilbur Mercer is not suffering at all."
The research chief said, "We've at last managed, Mr. Friendly, to track down a former
Hollywood special-effects man, a Mr. Wade Cortot, who flatly states, from his years of ex-perience,
that the figure of 'Mercer' could well be merely some bit player marching across a sound stage.
Cortot has gone so far as to declare that he recognizes the stage as one used by a now out-ofbusiness minor moviemaker with whom Cortot had various dealings several decades ago."

94

"So according to Cortot," Buster Friendly said, "there can be virtually no doubt."
Pris had now cut three legs from the spider, which crept about miserably on the kitchen table,
seeking a way out, a path to freedom. It found none.
"Quite frankly we believed Cortot," the research chief said in his dry, pedantic voice, "and we
spent a good deal of time examining publicity pictures of bit players once employed by the now
defunct Hollywood movie industry."
"And you found - "
"Listen to this," Roy Baty said. Irmgard gazed fixedly at the TV screen and Pris had ceased her
mutilation of the spider.
"We located, by means of thousands upon thousands of photographs, a very old man now, named
Al Jarry, who played a number of bit parts in pre-war films. From our lab we sent a team to Jarry's
home in East Harmony, Indiana. I'll let one of the members of that team describe what he found."
Silence, then a new voice, equally pedestrian. "The house on Lark Avenue in East Harmony is
tottering and shabby and at the edge of town, where no one, except Al Jarry, still lives. Invited
amiably in, and seated in the stale-smelling, moldering, kipple-filled living room, I scanned by
telepathic means the blurred, debris-cluttered, and hazy mind of Al Jarry seated across from me."
"Listen," Roy Baty said, on the edge of his seat, poised as if to pounce.
"I found," the technician continued, "that the old man did in actuality make a series of short fifteen
minute video films, for an employer whom he never met. And, as we had theorized, the 'rocks' did
consist of rubber-like plastic. The 'blood' shed was catsup, and " - the technician chuckled - the only
suffering Mr. Jarry underwent was having to go an entire day without a shot of whisky."
"Al Jarry," Buster Friendly said, his face returning to the screen. "Well, well. An old man who even
in his prime never amounted to anything which either he or ourselves could respect. Al Jarry made a
repetitious and dull film, a series of them in fact, for whom he knew not - and does not to this day. It
has often been said by adherents of the experience of Mercerism that Wilbur Mercer is not a human
being, that he is in fact an archetypal superior entity perhaps from another star. Well, in a sense this
contention has proven correct. Wilbur Mercer is not human, does not in fact exist. The world in
which he climbs is a cheap, Hollywood, commonplace sound stage which vanished into kipple years
ago. And who, then, has spawned this hoax on the Sol System? Think about that for a time, folks."
"We may never know," Irmgard murmured.
Buster Friendly said, "We may never know. Nor can we fathom the peculiar purpose behind this
swindle. Yes, folks, swindle. Mercerism is a swindle!"
"I think we know," Roy Baty said. "It's obvious. Mercerism came into existence - "
"But ponder this," Buster Friendly continued. "Ask yourselves what is it that Mercerism does.
Well, if we're to be1ieve its many practitioners, the experience fuses - "
It's that empathy that humans have," Irmgard said " - men and women throughout the Sol System
into a single entity. But an entity which is manageable by the so called telepathic voice of 'Mercer.'
Mark that. An ambitious politically minded would-be Hitler could - "
"No, it's that empathy," Irmgard said vigorously. Fists clenched, she roved into the kitchen, up to
Isidore. "Isn't it a way of proving that humans can do something we can't do? Because without the
Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business, this shared, group
thing. How's the spider?" She bent over Pris's shoulder.
With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the spider's legs. "Four now," she said. She nudged
the spider. "He won't go. But he can."
Roy Baty appeared at the doorway, inhaling deeply an expression of accomplishment on his face.
"It's done. Buster said it out loud, and nearly every human in the system heard him say it. 'Mercerism

95

is a swindle.' The whole experience of empathy is a swindle." He came over to look curiously at the
spider.
"It won't try to walk," Irmgard said.
"I can make it walk." Roy Baty got out a book of matches, lit a match; he held it near the spider,
closer and closer, until at last it crept feebly away.
"I was right," Irmgard said. "Didn't I say it could walk with only four legs?" She peered up
expectantly at Isidore. "What's the matter?" Touching his arm she said, "You didn't lose anything;
we'll pay you what that - what's it called?- that Sidney's catalogue says. Don't look so grim. Isn't that
something about Mercer, what they discovered? All that research? Hey, answer." She prodded him
anxiously.
"He's upset," Pris said. "Because he has an empathy box. In the other room. Do you use it, J.R.?"
she asked Isidore. Roy Baty said, "Of course he uses it. They - all do - or did. Maybe now they'll
start wondering."
"I don't think this will end the cult of Mercer," Pris said. "But right this minute there're a lot of
unhappy human beings." To Isidore she said, "We've waited for months; we all knew it was coming,
this pitch of Buster's." She hesitated and then said, "Well, why not. Buster is one of us."
"An android," Irmgard explained. "And nobody knows. No humans, I mean."
Pris, with the scissors, cut yet another leg from the spider. All at once John Isidore pushed her
away and lifted up the mutilated creature. He carried it to the sink and there he drowned it. In him his
mind, his hopes, drowned, too. As swiftly as the spider.
"He's really upset," Irmgard said nervously. "Don't look like that, J.R. And why don't you say
anything?" To Pris and to her husband she said, "It makes me terribly upset, him Just standing there
by the sink and not speaking; he hasn't said anything since we turned on the TV."
"It's not the TV," Pris said. "It's the spider. Isn't it, John R. Isidore:' He'll get over it," she said to
Irmgard, who had gone into the other room to shut off the TV.
Regarding Isidore with easy amusement, Roy Baty said, "It's all over now, Iz. For Mercerism, I
mean." With his nails he managed to lift the corpse of the spider from the sink. "Maybe this was the
last spider," he said. "The last living spider on Earth." He reflected. "In that case it's all over for
spiders, too."
"I - don't feel well," Isidore said. From the kitchen cupboard he got a cup; he stood holding it for
an interval - he did not know exactly how long. And then he said to Roy Baty, "Is the sky behind Mercer just painted? Not real?"
"You saw the enlargements on the TV screen," Roy Baty said. "The brushstrokes."
"Mercerism isn't finished," Isidore said. Something ailed the three androids, something terrible. The
spider, he thought. Maybe it had been the last spider on Earth, as Roy Baty said. And the spider is
gone; Mercer is gone; he saw the dust and the ruin of the apartment as it lay spreading out
everywhere - he heard the kipple coming, the final disorder of all forms, the absence which would
win out. It grew around him as he stood holding the empty ceramic cup; the cupboards of the kitchen
creaked and split and he felt the floor beneath his feet give.
Reaching out, he touched the wall. His hand broke the surface; gray particles trickled and hurried
down, fragments of plaster resembling the radioactive dust outside. He seated himself at the table
and, like rotten, hollow tubes the legs of the chair bent; standing quickly, he set down the cup and
tried to reform the chair, tried to press it back into its right shape. The chair came apart in his hands,
the screws which had previously connected its several sections ripping out and hanging loose. He
saw, on the table, the ceramic cup crack; webs of fine lines grew like the shadows of a vine, and
then a chip dropped from the edge of the cup, exposing the rough, unglazed interior.

96

"What's he doing?" Irmgard Baty's voice came to him distantly. "He's breaking everything! Isidore,
stop - "
"I'm not doing it," he said. He walked unsteadily into the living room, to be by himself; he stood by
the tattered couch and gazed at the yellow, stained wall with all the spots which dead bugs, that had
once crawled, had left, and again he thought of the corpse of the spider with its four remaining legs.
Everything in here is old, he realized. It long ago began to decay and it won't stop. The corpse of the
spider has taken over.
In the depression caused by the sagging of the floor, pieces of animals manifested themselves, the
head of a crow, mummified hands which might have once been parts of monkeys. A donkey stood a
little way off, not stirring and yet apparently alive; at least it had not begun to deteriorate. He started
toward it, feeling stick-like bones, dry as weeds, splinter under his shoes. But before he could reach
the donkey - one of the creatures which he loved the most - a shiny blue crow fell from above to
perch on the donkey's unprotesting muzzle. Don't, he said aloud, but the crow, rapidly, picked out
the donkey's eyes. Again, he thought. It's happening to me again. I will be down here a long time, he
realized. As before. It's always long, because nothing here ever changes; a point comes when it does
not even decay.
A dry wind rustled, and around him the heaps of bones broke. Even the wind destroys them, he
perceived. At this stage. just before time ceases. I wish I could remember how to climb up from
here, he thought. Looking up he saw nothing to grasp.
Mercer, he said aloud. Where are you now? This is the tomb world and I am in it again, but this
time you're not here too.
Something crept across his foot. He knelt down and searched for it - and found it because it
moved so slowly. The mutilated spider, advancing itself haltingly on its surviving legs; he picked it up
and held it in the palm of his hand. The bones, he realized, have reversed themselves; the spider is
again alive. Mercer must be near.
The wind blew, cracking and splintering the remaining bones, but he sensed the presence of
Mercer. Come here, he said to Mercer. Crawl across my foot or find some other way of reaching
me. Okay? Mercer, he thought. Aloud he said, "Mercer!"
Across the landscape weeds advanced; weeds corkscrewed their way into the walls around him
and worked the walls until they the weeds became their own spore. The spore expanded, split, and
burst within the corrupted steel and shards of concrete that had formerly been walls. But the
desolation remained after the walls had gone; the desolation followed after everything else. Except
the frail, dim figure of Mercer; the old man faced him, a placid expression on his face.
"Is the sky painted?" Isidore asked. "Are there really brushstrokes that show up under
magnification?"
"Yes," Mercer said.
"I can't see them."
"You're too close," Mercer said. "You have to be a long way off, the way the androids are. They
have better perspective."
"Is that why they claim you're a fraud?"
"I am a fraud," Mercer said. "They're sincere; their research is sincere. From their standpoint I am
an elderly retired bit player named Al Jarry. All of it, their disclosure, is true. They interviewed me at
my home, as they claim; I told them whatever they wanted to know, which was everything."
"Including about the whisky?"
Mercer smiled. "It was true. They did a good job and from their standpoint Buster Friendly's
disclosure was convincing. They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed. Because

97

you're still here and I'm still here." Mercer indicated with a sweep of his hand the barren, rising
hillside, the familiar place. "I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you
until you lose interest and want to quit. But you will have to stop searching for me because I will
never stop searching for you."
"I didn't like that about the whisky," Isidore said. "That's lowering."
"That's because you're a highly moral person. I'm not. I don't judge, not even myself." Mercer held
out a closed hand, palm up. "Before I forget it, I have something of yours here." He opened his
fingers. On his hand rested the mutilated spider, but with its snipped-off legs restored.
"Thanks." Isidore accepted the spider. He started to say something further An alarm bell clanged.
Roy Baty snarled, "There's a bounty hunter in the building! Get all the lights off. Get him away
from that empathy box; he has to be ready at the door. Go on - move him!"

98

NINETEEN
Looking down, John Isidore saw his own hands; they gripped the twin handles of the empathy
box. As he stood gaping at them, the lights in the living room of his apartment plunged out. He could
see, in the kitchen, Pris hurrying to catch the table lamp there.
"Listen, J.R.," Irmgard whispered harshly in his ear; she had grabbed him by the shoulder, her nails
digging into him with frantic intensity. She seemed unaware of what she did, now; in the dim
nocturnal light from outdoors Irmgard's face had become distorted, astigmatic. It had turned into - a
craven dish, with cowering, tiny, lidless eyes. "You have to go," she whispered, "to the door, when
he knocks, if he does knock; you have to show him your identification and tell him this is your
apartment and no one else is here. And you ask to see a warrant."
Pris, standing on the other side of him, her body arched, whispered, "Don't let him in, J.R. Say
anything; do anything that will stop him. Do you know what a bounty hunter would do let loose in
here? Do you understand what he would do to us? "
Moving away from the two android females Isidore groped his way to the door; with his fingers he
located the knob, halted there, listening. He could sense the hall outside, is he always had sensed it:
vacant and reverberating and lifeless.
"Hear anything?" Roy Baty said, bending close. Isidore smelled the rank, cringing body; he inhaled
fear from it, fear pouring out, forming a mist. "Step out and take a look."
Opening the door, Isidore looked up and down the indistinct hall. The air out here had a clear
quality, despite the weight of dust. He still held the spider which Mercer had given him. Was it
actually the spider which Pris had snipped apart with Irmgard Baty's cuticle scissors? Probably not.
He would never know. But anyhow it was alive; it crept about within his closed hand, not biting him:
as with most small spiders its mandibles could not puncture human skin.
He reached the end of the hall, descended the stairs, and stepped outside, onto what had once
been a terraced path, garden-enclosed. The garden had perished during the war and the path had
ruptured in a thousand places. But he knew its surface; under his feet the familiar path felt good, and
he followed it, passed along the greater side of the building, coming at last to the only verdant spot in
the vicinity - a yard-square patch of dust-saturated, drooping weeds. There he deposited the spider.
He experienced its wavering progress as it departed his hand. Well, that was that; he straightened
up.
A flashlight beam focused on the weeds; in its glare their half-dead stalks appeared stark,
menacing. Now he could see the spider; it rested on a serrated leaf. So it had gotten away all right.
"What did you do?" the man holding the flashlight asked.
"I put down a spider," he said, wondering why the man didn't see; in the beam of yellow light the
spider bloated up larger than life. "So it could get away."
"Why don't you take it up to your apartment? You ought to keep it in a jar. According to the
January Sidney's most spiders are up ten percent in retail price. You could have gotten a hundred
and some odd dollars for it."
Isidore said, "If I took it back up there she'd cut it apart again. Bit by bit, to see what it did."
"Androids do that," the man said. Reaching into his overcoat he brought out something which he
flapped open and extended toward Isidore.
In the irregular light the bounty hunter seemed a medium man, not impressive. Round face and
hairless, smooth features; like a clerk in a bureaucratic office. Methodical but informal. Not demigod in shape; not at all as Isidore had anticipated him.

99

"I'm an investigator for the San Francisco Police Department. Deckard, Rick Deckard." The man
flapped his ID shut again, stuck it back in his overcoat pocket. "They're up there now? The three?"
"Well, the thing is," Isidore said, "I'm looking after them. Two are women. They're the last ones of
the group; the rest are dead. I brought Pris's TV set up from her apartment and put it in mine, so they
could watch Buster Friendly. Buster proved beyond a doubt that Mercer doesn't exist." Isidore felt
excitement, knowing something of this importance - news that the bounty hunter evidently hadn't
heard.
"Let's go up there," Deckard said. Suddenly he held a laser tube pointed at Isidore; then,
indecisively, he put it away. "You're a special, aren't you," he said. "A chickenhead."
"But I have a job. I drive a truck for - " Horrified, he discovered he had forgotten the name. " - a
pet hospital," he said. "The Van Ness Pet Hospital," he said. "Owned b-b-by Hannibal Sloat."
Deckard said, "Will you take me up there and show me which apartment they're in? There're over
a thousand separate apartments; you can save me a lot of time." His voice dipped with fatigue.
"If you kill them you won't be able to fuse with Mercer again," Isidore said.
"You won't take me up there? Show me which floor? Just tell me the floor. I'll figure out which
apartment on the floor it is."
"No," Isidore said.
"Under state and federal law," Deckard began. He ceased, then. Giving up the interrogation.
"Good night," he said, and walked away, up the path and into the building, his flashlight bleeding a
yellowed, diffuse path before him.
Inside the conapt building, Rick Deckard shut off his flashlight; guided by the ineffectual, recessed
bulbs spaced ahead of him he made his way along the hall, thinking, The chickenhead knows they're
androids; he knew it already, before I told him. But he doesn't understand. On the other hand, who
does? Do I? Did I? And one of them will be a duplicate of Rachael, he reflected. Maybe the special
has been living with her. I wonder how he liked it, he asked himself. Maybe that was the one who he
believed would cut up his spider. I could go back and get that spider, he reflected. I've never found a
live, wild animal. It must be a fantastic experience to look down and see something living scuttling
along. Maybe it'll happen someday to me like it did him.
He had brought listening gear from his car; he set it up, now, a revolving detek-snout with blip
screen. In the silence of the hall the screen indicated nothing. Not on this floor, he said to himself. He
clicked over to vertical. On that axis the snout absorbed a faint signal. Upstairs. He gathered up the
gear and his briefcase and climbed the stairs to the next floor.
A figure in the shadows waited.
"If you move I'll retire you," Rick said. The male one, waiting for him. In his clenched fingers the
laser tube felt hard but he could not lift it and aim it. He had been caught first, caught too soon.
"I'm not an android," the figure said. "My name is Mercer." It stepped into a zone of light. "I
inhabit this building because of Mr. Isidore. The special who had the spider; you talked briefly to him
outside."
"Am I outside Mercerism, now?" Rick said. "As the chickenhead said? Because of what I'm going
to do in the next few minutes?"
Mercer said, "Mr. Isidore spoke for himself, not for me. What you are doing has to be done. I
said that already." Raising his arm he pointed at the stairs behind Rick. "I came to tell you that one of
them is behind you and below, not in the apartment. It will be the hard one of the three and you must
retire it first." The rustling, ancient voice gained abrupt fervor. "Quick, Mr. Deckard. On the steps."

100

His laser tube thrust out, Rick spun and sank onto his haunches facing the flight of stairs. Up it
glided a woman, toward him, and he knew her; he recognized her and lowered his laser tube.
"Rachael" he said, perplexed. Had she followed him in her own hovercar, tracked him here? And
why? "Go back to Seattle," he said. "Leave me alone; Mercer told me I've got to do it." And then he
saw that it was not quite Rachael.
"For what we've meant to each other," the android said as it approached him, its arms reaching as
if to clutch at him. The clothes, he thought, are wrong. But the eyes, the same eyes. And there are
more like this; there can be a legion of her, each with its own name, but all Rachael Rosen - Rachael,
the prototype, used by the manufacturer to protect the others. He fired at her as, imploringly, she
dashed toward him. The android burst and parts of it flew; he covered his face and then looked
again, looked and saw the laser tube which it had carried roll away, back onto the stairs; the metal
tube bounced downward, step by step, the sound echoing and diminishing and slowing. The hard
one of the three, Mercer had said. He peered about, searching for Mercer. The old man had gone.
They can follow me with Rachael Rosens until I die, he thought, or until the type becomes obsolete,
whichever comes first. And now the other two, he thought. One of them is not in the apartment,
Mercer had said. Mercer protected me, he realized. Manifested himself and offered aid. She - it would have gotten me, he said to himself, except for the fact that Mercer warned me. I can do the
rest, now, he realized. This was the impossible one; she knew I couldn't do this. But it's over. In an
instant. I did what I couldn't do. The Batys I can track by standard procedure; they will be hard but
they won't be like this.
He stood alone in the empty hall; Mercer had left him because he had done what he came for,
Rachael - or rather Pris Stratton - had been dismembered and that left nothing now, only himself. But
elsewhere in the building; the Batys waited and knew. Perceived what he had done, here. Probably,
at this point, they were afraid. This had been their response to his presence in the building. Their
attempt. Without Mercer it would have worked. For them, winter had come.
This has to be done quickly, what I'm after now, he realized; he hurried down the hall and all at
once his detection gear registered the presence of cephalic activity. He had found their apartment.
No more need of the gear; he discarded it and rapped on the apartment door.
From within, a man's voice sounded. "Who is it?"
"This is Mr. Isidore," Rick said. "Let me in because I'm looking after you and t-t-two of you are
women."
"We're not opening the door," a woman's voice came.
"I want to watch Buster Friendly on Pris's TV set," Rick said. "Now that he's proved Mercer
doesn't exist it's very important to watch him. I drive a truck for the Van Ness Pet Hospital, which is
owned by Mr. Hannibal S-s-sloat." He made himself stammer. "S-s-so would you open the d-ddoor? It's my apartment." He waited, and the door opened. Within the apartment he saw darkness
and indistinct shapes, two of them.
The smaller shape, the woman, said, "You have to administer tests."
"It's too late," Rick said. The taller figure tried to push the door shut and turn on some variety of
electronic equipment. "No," Rick said, "I have to come in." He let Roy Baty fire once; he held his
own fire until the laser beam had passed by him as he twisted out of the way. "You've lost your legal
basis," Rick said, "by firing on me. You should have forced me to give you the Voigt-Kampff test.
But now it doesn't matter." Once more Roy Baty sent a laser beam cutting at him, missed, dropped
the tube, and ran somewhere deeper inside the apartment, to another room, perhaps, the electronic
hardware abandoned.
"Why didn't Pris get you?" Mrs. Baty said.

101

"There is no Pris," he said. "Only Rachael Rosen, over and over again." He saw the laser tube in
her dimly outlined hand; Roy Baty had slipped it to her, had meant to decoy him into the apartment,
far in, so that Irmgard Baty could get him from behind, in the back. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Baty," Rick said,
and shot her.
Roy Baty, in the other room, let out a cry of anguish.
"Okay, you loved her," Rick said. "And I loved Rachael. And the special loved the other
Rachael." He shot Roy Baty; the big man's corpse lashed about, toppled like an overstacked
collection of separate, brittle entities; it smashed into the kitchen table and carried dishes and flatware
down with it. Reflex circuits in the corpse made it twitch and flutter, but it had died; Rick ignored it,
not seeing it and not seeing that of Irmgard Baty by the front door. I got the last one, Rick realized.
Six today; almost a record. And now it's over and I can go home, back to Iran and the goat. And
we'll have enough money, for once.
He sat down on the couch and presently as he sat there in the silence of the apartment, among the
nonstirring objects, the special Mr. Isidore appeared at the door.
"Better not look," Rick said.
"I saw her on the stairs. Pris." The special was crying.
"Don't take it so hard," Rick said. He got dizzily to his feet, laboring. "Where's your phone?"
The special said nothing, did nothing except stand. So Rick hunted for the phone himself, found it,
and dialed Harry Bryant's office.

102

TWENTY
"Good," Harrv Bryant said, after he had been told. "Well, go get some rest. We'll send a patrol
car to pick up the three bodies."
Rick Deckard hung up. "Androids are stupid," he said savagely to the special. "Roy Baty couldn't
tell me from you; it thought you were at the door. The police will clean up in here; why don't you stay
in another apartment until they're finished? You don't want to be in here with what's left."
"I'm leaving this b-b-building," Isidore said. "I'm going to l-l-live deeper in town where there's mm-more people."
"I think there's a vacant apartment in my building," Rick said.
Isidore stammered, "I don't w-w-want to live near you."
"Go outside or upstairs," Rick said. "Don't stay in here."
The special floundered, not knowing what to do; a variety of mute expressions crossed his face
and then, turning, he shuffled out of the apartment, leaving Rick alone.
What a job to have to do, Rick thought. I'm a scoure, like famine or plague. Where I go the
ancient curse follows.
As Mercer said, I am required to do wrong. Everything I've done has been wrong from the start.
Anyhow now it's time to go home. Maybe, after I've been there awhile with Iran I'll forget.
When he got back to his own apartment building, Iran met him on the roof. She looked at him in a
deranged, peculiar way; in all his years with her he had never seen her like this.
Putting his arm around her he said, "Anyhow it's over. And I've been thinking; maybe Harry
Bryant can assign me to a - "
"Rick," she said, "I have to tell you something. I'm sorry. The goat is dead."
For some reason it did not surprise him; it only made him feel worse, a quantitative addition to the
weight shrinking him from every side. "I think there's a guarantee in the contract," he said. "If it gets
sick within ninety days the dealer - "
"It didn't get sick. Someone" - Iran cleared her throat and went on huskily - "someone came here,
got the goat out of its cage, and dragged it to the edge of the roof."
"And pushed it off?" he said.
"Yes." She nodded.
"Did you see who did it?"
"I saw her very clearly," Iran said. "Barbour was still up here fooling around; he came down to get
me and we called the police, but by then the animal was dead and she had left. A small younglooking girl with dark hair and large black eyes, very thin. Wearing a long fish-scale coat. She had a
mail-pouch purse. And she made no effort to keep us from seeing her. As if she didn't care."
"No, she didn't care," he said. "Rachael wouldn't give a damn if you saw her; she probably wanted
you to, so I'd know who had done it." He kissed her. "You've been waiting up here all this time?"
"Only for half an hour. That's when it happened; half an hour ago." Iran, gently, kissed him back.
It's so awful. So needless."
He turned toward his parked car, opened the door, and got in behind the wheel. "Not needless,"
he said. "She had what seemed to her a reason." An android reason, he thought.
"Where are you going? Won't you come downstairs and be with me? There was the most
shocking news on TV; Buster Friendly claims that Mercer is a fake. What do you think about that,
Rick? Do you think it could be true?"

103

"Everything is true," he said. "Everything anybody has ever thought." He snapped on the car
motor.
"Will you be all right?"
"I'll be all right," he said, and thought, And I'm going to die. Both those are true, too. He closed
the car door, flicked a signal with his hand to Iran, and then swept up into the night sky.
Once, he thought, I would have seen the stars. Years ago. But now it's only the dust; no one has
seen a star in years, at least not from Earth. Maybe I'll go where I can see stars, he said to himself as
the car gained velocity and altitude; it headed away from San Francisco, toward the uninhabited
desolation to the north. To the place where no living thing would go. Not unless it felt that the end
had come.

104

TWENTY-ONE
In the early morning light the land below him extended seemingly forever, gray and refuse-littered.
Pebbles the size of houses had rolled to a stop next to one another and he thought, It's like a shipping
room when all the merchandise has left. Only fragments of crates remain, the containers which signify
nothing in themselves. Once, he thought, crops grew here and animals grazed. What a remarkable
thought, that anything could have cropped grass here.
What a strange place he thought for all of that to die.
He brought the hovercar down, coasted above the surface for a time. What would Dave Holden
say about me now? he asked himself. In one sense I'm now the greatest bounty hunter who ever
lived; no one ever retired six Nexus-6 types in one twenty-four-hour span and no one probably ever
will again. I ought to call him, he said to himself.
A cluttered hillside swooped up at him; he lifted the hovercar as the world came close. Fatigue, he
thought; I shouldn't be driving still. He clicked off the ignition, glided for an interval, and then set the
hovercar down. It tumbled and bounced across the hillside, scattering rocks; headed upward, it
came at last to a grinding, skittering stop.
Picking up the receiver of the car's phone he dialed the operator at San Francisco. "Give me
Mount Zion Hospital" he told her.
Presently he had another operator on the vidscreen. "Mount Zion Hospital."
"You have a patient named Dave Holden," he said. "Would it be possible to talk to him? Is he well
enough?"
"Just a moment and I'll check on that, sir." The screen temporarily blanked out. Time passed. Rick
took a pinch of Dr. Johnson Snuff and shivered; without the car's heater the temperature had begun
to plunge. "Dr. Costa says that Mr. Holden is not receiving calls," the operator told him, reappearing.
"This is police business," he said; he held his flat pack of ID up to the screen.
"Just a moment." Again the operator vanished. Again Rick inhaled a pinch of Dr. Johnson Snuff;
the menthol in it tasted foul, so early in the morning. He rolled down the car window and tossed the
little yellow tin out into the rubble. "No, sir," the operator said, once more on his screen. "Dr. Costa
does not feel Mr. Holden's condition will permit him to take any calls, no matter how urgent, for at
least - "
"Okay," Rick said. He hung up.
The air, too, had a foul quality; he rolled up the window again. Dave is really out, he reflected. I
wonder why they didn't get me. Because I moved too fast, he decided. All in one day; they couldn't
have expected it. Harry Bryant was right.
The car had become too cold, now, so he opened the door and stepped out. A noxious,
unexpected wind filtered through his clothes and he began to walk, rubbing his hands together.
It would have been rewarding to talk to Dave, he decided. Dave would have approved what I
did. But also he would have understood the other part, which I don't think even Mercer
comprehends. For Mercer everything is easy, he thought, because Mercer accepts everything.
Nothing is alien to him. But what I've done, he thought; that's become alien to me. In fact everything
about me has become unnatural; I've become an unnatural self.
He walked on, up the hillside, and with each step the weight on him grew. Too tired, he thought,
to climb. Stopping, he wiped stinging sweat from his eyes, salt tears produced by his skin, his whole
aching body. Then, angry at himself, he spat - spat with wrath and contempt, for himself, with utter
hate, onto the barren ground. Thereupon he resumed his trudge up the slope, the lonely and
unfamiliar terrain, remote from everything; nothing lived here except himself.

105

The heat. It had become hot, now; evidently time had passed. And he felt hunger. He had not
eaten for god knew how long. The hunger and heat combined, a poisonous taste resembling defeat;
yes, he thought, that's what it is: I've been defeated in some obscure way. By having killed the
androids? By Rachael's murder of my goat? He did not know, but as he plodded along a vague and
almost hallucinatory pall hazed over his mind; he found himself at one point, with no notion of how it
could be, a step from an almost certainly fatal cliffside fall - falling humiliatingly and helplessly, he
thought; on and on, with no one even to witness it. Here there existed no one to record his or anyone
else's degradation, and any courage or pride which might manifest itself here at the end would go
unmarked - the dead stones, the dust-stricken weeds dry and dying, perceived nothing, recollected
nothing, about him or themselves.
At that moment the first rock - and it was not rubber or soft foam plastic - struck him in the
inguinal region. And the pain, the first knowledge of absolute isolation and suffering, touched him
throughout in its undisguised actual form.
He halted. And then, goaded on - the goad invisible but real, not to be challenged - he resumed
his climb. Rolling upward, he thought, like the stones; I am doing what stones do, without volition.
Without it meaning anything.
"Mercer," he said, panting; he stopped, stood still. In front of him he distinguished a shadowy
figure, motionless. "Wilbur Mercer! Is that you?" My god, he realized; it's my shadow. I have to get
out of here, down off this hill!
He scrambled back down. Once, he fell; clouds of dust obscured everything, and he ran from the
dust - he hurried faster, sliding and tumbling on the loose pebbles. Ahead he saw his parked car. I'm
back down, he said to himself. I'm off the hill. He plucked open the car door, squeezed inside. Who
threw the stone at me? he asked himself. No one. But why does it bother me? I've undergone it
before, during fusion. While using my empathy box, like everyone else. This isn't new. But it was.
Because, he thought, I did it alone.
Trembling, he got a fresh new tin of snuff from the glove compartment of the car; pulling off the
protective band of tape he took a massive pinch, rested, sitting half in the car and half out, his feet on
the arid, dusty soil. This was the last place to go to, he realized. I shouldn't have flown here. And
now he found himself too tired to fly back out.
If I could just talk to Dave, he thought, I'd be all right; I could get away from here, go home and
go to bed. I still have my electric sheep and I still have my job. There'll be more andys to retire; my
career isn't over; I haven't retired the last andy in existence. Maybe that's what it is, he thought. I'm
afraid there aren't any more.
He looked at his watch. Nine-thirty.
Picking up the vidphone receiver he dialed the Hall of Justice on Lombard. "Let me speak to
Inspector Bryant," he said to the police switchboard operator Miss Wild.
"Inspector Bryant is not in his office, Mr. Deckard; he's out in his car, but I don't get any answer.
He must have temporarily left his car."
"Did he say where he intended to go?"
"Something about the androids you retired last night."
"Let me talk to my secretary," he said.
A moment later the orange, triangular face of Ann Marsten appeared on the screen. "Oh, Mr.
Deckard - Inspector Bryant has been trying to get hold of you. I think he's turning your name over to
Chief Cutter for a citation. Because you retired those six - "
"I know what I did," he said.

106

"That's never happened before. Oh, and Mr. Deckard; your wife phoned. She wants to know if
you're all right. Are you all right?"
He said nothing.
"Anyhow," Miss Marsten said, "maybe you should call her and tell her. She left word she'll be
home, waiting to hear from you."
"Did you hear about my goat?" he said.
"No, I didn't even know you had a goat."
Rick said, "They took my goat."
"Who did, Mr. Deckard? Animal thieves? We just got a report on a huge new gang of them,
probably teenagers, operating in - "
"Life thieves," he said.
"I don't understand you, Mr. Deckard." Miss Marsten peered at him intently. "Mr. Deckard, you
look awful. So tired. And god, your cheek is bleeding."
Putting his band up he felt the blood. From a rock, probably. More than one, evidently, had
struck him.
"You look," Miss Marsten said, "like Wilbur Mercer."
"I am," he said. "I'm Wilbur Mercer; I've permanently fused with him. And I can't unfuse. I'm
sitting here waiting to unfuse. Somewhere near the Oregon border."
"Shall we send someone out? A department car to pick you up?"
"No," he said. "I'm no longer with the department."
"Obviously you did too much yesterday, Mr. Deckard," she said chidingly. "What you need now
is bed rest. Mr. Deckard, you're our best bounty hunter, the best we've ever had. I'll tell Inspector
Bryant when he comes in; you go on home and go to bed. Call your wife right away, Mr. Deckard,
because she's terribly, terribly worried. I could tell. You're both in dreadful shape."
"It's because of my goat," he said. "Not the androids; Rachael was wrong - I didn't have any
trouble retiring them. And the special was wrong, too, about my not being able to fuse with Mercer
again. The only one who was right is Mercer."
"You better get back here to the Bay Area, Mr. Deckard. Where there're people. There isn't
anything living up there near Oregon; isn't that right? Aren't you alone?"
"It's strange," Rick said. "I had the absolute, utter, completely real illusion that I had become
Mercer and people were lobbing rocks at me. But not the way you experience it when you hold the
handles of an empathy box. When you use an empathy box you feel you're with Mercer. The
difference is I wasn't with anyone; I was alone."
"They're saying now that Mercer is a fake."
"Mercer isn't a fake," he said. "Unless reality is a fake." This hill, he thought. This dust and these
many stones, each one different from all the others. "I'm afraid," he said, "that I can't stop being
Mercer. Once you start it's too late to back off." Will I have to climb the hill again? he wondered.
Forever, as Mercer does . . . trapped by eternity. "Goodby," he said, and started to ring off.
"You'll call your wife? You promise?"
"Yes." He nodded. "Thanks, Ann." He hung up. Bed rest, he thought. The last time I hit bed was
with Rachael. A violation of a statute. Copulation with an android; absolutely against the law, here
and on the colony worlds as well. She must be back in Seattle now. With the other Rosens, real and
humanoid. I wish I could do to you what you did to me, he wished. But it can't be done to an android because they don't care. If I had killed you last night my goat would be alive now. There's
where I made the wrong decision. Yes, he thought; it can all be traced back to that and to my going

107

to bed with you. Anyhow you were correct about one thing; it did change me. But not in the way you
predicted.
A much worse way, he decided.
And yet I don't really care. Not any longer. Not, he thought, after what happened to me up there,
toward the top of the hill. I wonder what would have come next, if I had gone on climbing and
reached the top. Because that's where Mercer appears to die. That's where Mercer's triumph
manifests itself, there at the end of the great sidereal cycle.
But if I'm Mercer, he thought, I can never die, not in ten thousand years. Mercer is immortal.
Once more he picked up the phone receiver, to call his wife.
And froze.

108

TWENTY-TWO
He set the receiver back down and did not take his eyes from the spot that had moved outside the
car. The bulge in the ground, among the stones. An animal, he said to himself. And his heart lugged
under the excessive load, the shock of recognition. I know what it is, he realized; I've never seen one
before but I know it from the old nature films they show on Government TV.
They're extinct! he said to himself; swiftly he dragged out his much-creased Sidney's, turned the
pages with twitching fingers.
TOAD (Bufonidae), all varieties . . . . . . . . . . . . . E.
Extinct for years now. The critter most precious to Wilbur Mercer, along with the donkey. But
toads most of all.
I need a box. He squirmed around, saw nothing in the back seat of the hovercar; he leaped out,
hurried to the trunk compartment, unlocked and opened it. There rested a car board container,
inside it a spare fuel pump for his car. He dumped the fuel pump out, found some furry hempish
twine, and walked slowly toward the toad. Not taking his eyes from it.
The toad, he saw, blended in totally with the texture and shade of the ever-present dust. It had,
perhaps, evolved, meeting the new climate as it had met all climates before. Had it not moved he
would never have spotted it; yet he had been sitting no more than two yards from it. What happens
when you find - if you find - an animal believed extinct? he asked himself, trying to remember. It
happened so seldom. Something about a star of honor from the U.N. and a stipend. A reward
running into millions of dollars. And of all possibilities - to find the critter most sacred to Mercer.
Jesus, he thought; it can't be. Maybe it's due to brain damage on my part: exposure to radioactivity.
I'm a special, he thought. Something has happened to me. Like the chickenhead Isidore and his
spider; what happened to him is happening to me. Did Mercer arrange it? But I'm Mercer. I
arranged it; I found the toad. Found it because I see through Mercer's eyes.
He squatted on his haunches, close beside the toad. It had shoved aside the grit to make a partial
hole for itself, displaced the dust with its rump. So that only the top of its flat skull and its eyes
projected above ground. Meanwhile, its metabolism slowed almost to a halt, it had drifted off into a
trance. The eyes held no spark, no awareness of him, and in horror he thought, It's dead, of thirst
maybe. But it had moved.
Setting the cardboard box down, he carefully began brushing the loose soil away from the toad. It
did not seem to object, but of course it was not aware of his existence.
When he lifted the toad out he felt its peculiar coolness; in his hands its body seemed dry and
wrinkled - almost flabby - and as cold as if it had taken up residence in a grotto miles under the earth
away from the sun. Now the toad squirmed; with its weak hind feet it tried to pry itself from his grip,
wanting, instinctively, to go flopping off. A big one, he thought; full-grown and wise. Capable, in its
own fashion, of surviving even that which we're not really managing to survive. I wonder where it
finds the water for its eggs.
So this is what Mercer sees, he thought as he painstakingly tied the cardboard box shut - tied it
again and again. Life which we can no longer distinguish; life carefully buried up to its forehead in the
carcass of a dead world. In every cinder of the universe Mercer probably perceives inconspicuous
life. Now I know, he thought. And once having seen through Mercer's eyes I probably will never
stop.
And no android, he thought, will cut the legs from this. As they did from the chickenhead's
spider.

109

He placed the carefully tied box on the car seat and got in behind the wheel. It's like being a kid
again, he Now all the weight had left him, the monumental oppressive fatigue. Wait until Iran hears
about this; he the vidphone receiver, started to dial. Then paused. it as a surprise, he concluded. It'll
only take thirty minutes to fly back there.
Eagerly he switched the motor on, and, shortly, had zipped up into the sky, in the direction of
San Francisco, seven hundred miles to the south.
At the Penfield mood organ, Iran Deckard sat with her right index finger touching the numbered
dial. But she did not dial; she felt too listless and ill to want anything: a burden which closed off the
future and any possibilities which it might once have contained. If Rick were here, she thought, he'd
get me to dial 3 and that way I'd find myself wanting to dial something important, ebullient joy or if
not that then possibly an 888, the desire to watch TV no matter what's on it. I wonder what is on it,
she thought. And then she wondered again where Rick had gone. He may be coming back and on
the other hand he may not be, she said to herself, and felt her bones within her shrink with age.
A knock sounded at the apartment door.
Putting down the Penfield manual she jumped up, thinking, I don't need to dial, now; I already
have it - if it is Rick. She ran to the door, opened the door wide.
"Hi," he said. There he stood, a cut on his cheek, his clothes wrinkled and gray, even his hair
saturated with dust. His hands, his face - dust clung to every part of him, except his eyes. Round with
awe his eyes shone, like those of a little boy; he looks, she thought, as if he has been playing and
now it's time to give up and come home. To rest and wash and tell about the miracles of the day.
"It's nice to see you," she said.
"I have something." He held a cardboard box with both hands; when he entered the apartment he
did not set it down. As if, she thought, it contained something too fragile and too valuable to let go of;
he wanted to keep it perpetually in his hands.
She said, "I'll fix you a cup of coffee." At the stove she pressed the coffee button and in a moment
had put the imposing mug by his place at the kitchen table. Still holding the box he seated himself,
and on his face the round-eyed wonder remained. In all the years she had known him she had not
encountered this expression before. Something had happened since she had seen him last; since, last
night, he had gone off in his car. Now he had come back and this box had arrived with him: he held,
in the box, everything that had happened to him.
"I'm going to sleep," he announced. "All day. I phoned in and got Harry Bryant; he said take the
day off and rest. Which is exactly what I'm going to do." Carefully he set the box down on the table
and picked up his coffee mug; dutifully, because she wanted him to, he drank his coffee.
Seating herself across from him she said, "What do you have in the box, Rick?
"A toad."
"Can I see it?" She watched as he untied the box and removed the lid. "Oh," she said, seeing the
toad; for some reason it frightened her. "Will it bite?" she asked.
"Pick it up. It won't bite; toads don't have teeth." Rick lifted the toad out and extended it toward
her. Stemming her aversion she accepted it. "I thought toads were extinct," she said as she turned it
over, curious about its legs; they seemed almost useless. "Can toads jump like frogs? I mean, will it
jump out of my hands suddenly?"
"The legs of toads are weak," Rick said. "That's the main difference between a toad and a frog,
that and water. A frog remains near water but a toad can live in the desert. I found this in the desert,
up near the Oregon border. Where everything had died." He reached to take it back from her. But

110

she had discovered something; still holding it upside down she poked at its abdomen and then, with
her nail, located the tiny control panel. She flipped the panel open.
"Oh." His face fell by degrees. "Yeah, so I see; you're right." Crestfallen, he gazed mutely at the
false animal; he took it back from her, fiddled with the legs as if baffled - he did not seem quite to
understand. He then carefully replaced it in its box. "I wonder how it got out there in the desolate
part of California like that. Somebody must have put it there. No way to tell what for."
"Maybe I shouldn't have told you - about it being electrical." She put her hand out, touched his
arm; she felt guilty, seeing the effect it had on him, the change.
"No," Rick said. "I'm glad to know. Or rather - " He became silent. "I'd prefer to know."
"Do you want to use the mood organ? To feel better? You always have gotten a lot out of it, more
than I ever have."
"I'll be okay." He shook his head, as if trying to clear it, still bewildered. "The spider Mercer gave
the chickenhead, Isidore; it probably was artificial, too. But it doesn't matter. The electric things have
their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are."
Iran said, "You look as if you've walked a hundred miles."
"It's been a long day." He nodded.
"Go get into bed and sleep."
He stared at her, then, as if perplexed. "It is over, isn't it?" Trustingly he seemed to be waiting for
her to tell him, as if she would know. As if hearing himself say it meant nothing; he had a dubious
attitude toward his own words; they didn't become real, not until she agreed.
"It's over," she said.
"God, what a marathon assignment," Rick said. "Once I began on it there wasn't any way for me
to stop; it kept carrying me along, until finally I got to the Batys, and then suddenly I didn't have
anything to do. And that - " He hesitated, evidently amazed at what he had begun to say. "That part
was worse," he said. "After I finished. I couldn't stop because there would be nothing left after I
stopped. You were right this morning when you said I'm nothing but a crude cop with crude cop
hands."
"I don't feel that any more," she said. "I'm just damn glad to have you come back home where you
ought to be." She kissed him and that seemed to please him; his face lit up, almost as much as before
- before she had shown him that the toad was electric.
"Do you think I did wrong?" he asked. "What I did today?
"No."
"Mercer said it was wrong but I should do it anyhow. Really weird. Sometimes it's better to do
something wrong than right."
"It's the curse on us," Iran said. "That Mercer talks about."
"The dust?" he asked.
"The killers that found Mercer in his sixteenth year, when they told him he couldn't reverse time
and bring things back to life again. So now all he can do is move along with life, going where it goes,
to death. And the killers throw the rocks; it's they who're doing it. Still pursuing him. And all of us,
actually. Did one of them cut your check, where it's been bleeding?"
"Yes," he said wanly.
"Will you go to bed now? If I set the mood organ to a 670 setting?"
"What does that bring about?" he asked.
"Long deserved peace," Iran said.
He got to his feet, stood painfully, his face drowsy and confused, as if a
legion of battles had
ebbed and advanced there, over many years. And then, by degrees, he progressed along the route

111

to the bedroom. "Okay," he said. "Long deserved peace." he stretched out on the bed, dust sifting
from his clothes and hair onto the white sheets.
No need to turn on the mood organ, Iran realized as she pressed the button which made the
windows of the bedroom opaque. The gray light of day disappeared.
On the bed Rick, after a moment, slept.
She stayed there for a time, keeping him in sight to be sure he wouldn't wake up, wouldn't spring
to a sitting position in fear as he sometimes did at night. And then, presently, she returned to the
kitchen, reseated herself at the kitchen table.
Next to her the electric toad flopped and rustled in its box; she wondered what it "ate," and what
repairs on it would run. Artificial flies, she decided.
Opening the phone book she looked in the yellow paces under animal accessories, electric; she
dialed and when the saleswoman answered, said, "I'd like to order one pound of artificial flies that
really fly around and buzz, please."
"Is it for an electric turtle, ma'am?"
"A toad," she said.
"Then I suggest our mixed assortment of artificial crawling and flying bugs of all types including - "
"The flies will do," Iran said. "Will you deliver? I don't want to leave my apartment; my husband's
asleep and I want to be sure he's all right."
The clerk said, "For a toad I'd suggest also a perpetually renewing puddle, unless it's a horned
toad, in which case there's a kit containing sand, multicolored pebbles, and bits of organic debris.
And if you're going to be putting it through its feed cycle regularly I suggest you let our service
department make a periodic tongue adjustment. In a toad that's vital."
"Fine," Iran said. "I want it to work perfectly. My husband is devoted to it." She gave her address
and hung up.
And, feeling better, fixed herself at last a cup of black, hot coffee.

Book One
THAT DINKUM THINKUM
1
I see in Lunaya Pravda that Luna City Council has passed on first reading
a bill to examine, license, inspect--and tax--public food vendors
operating inside municipal pressure. I see also is to be mass meeting
tonight to organize "Sons of Revolution" talk-talk.
My old man taught me two things: "Mind own business" and "Always
cut cards." Politics never tempted me. But on Monday 13 May 2075 I was in
computer room of Lunar Authority Complex, visiting with computer boss
Mike while other machines whispered among themselves. Mike was not
official name; I had nicknamed him for Mycroft Holmes, in a story written
by Dr. Watson before he founded IBM. This story character would just sit
and think--and that's what Mike did. Mike was a fair dinkum thinkum,
sharpest computer you'll ever meet.
Not fastest. At Bell Labs, Bueno Aires, down Earthside, they've got
a thinkum a tenth his size which can answer almost before you ask. But

matters whether you get answer in microsecond rather than millisecond as
long as correct?
Not that Mike would necessarily give right answer; he wasn't
completely honest.
When Mike was installed in Luna, he was pure thinkum, a flexible
logic--"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV,
Mod. L"--a HOLMES FOUR. He computed ballistics for pilotless freighters
and controlled their catapult. This kept him busy less than one percent
of time and Luna Authority never believed in idle hands. They kept
hooking hardware into him--decision-action boxes to let him boss other
computers, bank on bank of additional memories, more banks of
associational neural nets, another tubful of twelve-digit random numbers,
a greatly augmented temporary memory. Human brain has around ten-to-thetenth neurons. By third year Mike had better than one and a half times
that number of neuristors.
And woke up.
Am not going to argue whether a machine can "really" be alive,
"really" be self-aware. Is a virus self-aware? Nyet. How about oyster? I
doubt it. A cat? Almost certainly. A human? Don't know about you,
tovarishch, but I am. Somewhere along evolutionary chain from
macromolecule to human brain self-awareness crept in. Psychologists
assert it happens automatically whenever a brain acquires certain very
high number of associational paths. Can't see it matters whether paths
are protein or platinum.
("Soul?" Does a dog have a soul? How about cockroach?)
Remember Mike was designed, even before augmented, to answer
questions tentatively on insufficient data like you do; that's "high
optional" and "multi-evaluating" part of name. So Mike started with "free
will" and acquired more as he was added to and as he learned--and don't
ask me to define "free will." If comforts you to think of Mike as simply
tossing random numbers in air and switching circuits to match, please do.
By then Mike had voder-vocoder circuits supplementing his readouts, print-outs, and decision-action boxes, and could understand not
only classic programming but also Loglan and English, and could accept
other languages and was doing technical translating--and reading
endlessly. But in giving him instructions was safer to use Loglan. If you
spoke English, results might be whimsical; multi-valued nature of English
gave option circuits too much leeway.
And Mike took on endless new jobs. In May 2075, besides controlling
robot traffic and catapult and giving ballistic advice and/or control for
manned ships, Mike controlled phone system for all Luna, same for LunaTerra voice & video, handled air, water, temperature, humidity, and
sewage for Luna City, Novy Leningrad, and several smaller warrens (not
Hong Kong in Luna), did accounting and payrolls for Luna Authority, and,
by lease, same for many firms and banks.
Some logics get nervous breakdowns. Overloaded phone system behaves
like frightened child. Mike did not have upsets, acquired sense of humor
instead. Low one. If he were a man, you wouldn't dare stoop over. His
idea of thigh-slapper would be to dump you out of bed--or put itch powder
in pressure suit.
Not being equipped for that, Mike indulged in phony answers with
skewed logic, or pranks like issuing pay cheque to a janitor in
Authority's Luna City office for AS$10, 000, 000, 000, 000, 185 .15--last

five digits being correct amount. Just a great big overgrown lovable kid
who ought to be kicked.
He did that first week in May and I had to troubleshoot. I was a
private contractor, not on Authority's payroll. You see---or perhaps not;
times have changed. Back in bad old days many a con served his time, then
went on working for Authority in same job, happy to draw wages. But I was
born free.
Makes difference. My one grandfather was shipped up from Joburg for
armed violence and no work permit, other got transported for subversive
activity after Wet Firecracker War. Maternal grandmother claimed she came
up in bride ship--but I've seen records; she was Peace Corps enrollee
(involuntary), which means what you think: juvenile delinquency female
type. As she was in early clan marriage (Stone Gang) and shared six
husbands with another woman, identity of maternal grandfather open to
question. But was often so and I'm content with grandpappy she picked.
Other grandmother was Tatar, born near Samarkand, sentenced to
"reeducation" on Oktyabrakaya Revolyutsiya, then "volunteered" to
colonize in Luna.
My old man claimed we had even longer distinguished line-ancestress hanged in Salem for witchcraft, a g'g'g'greatgrandfather
broken on wheel for piracy, another ancestress in first shipload to
Botany Bay.
Proud of my ancestry and while I did business with Warden, would
never go on his payroll. Perhaps distinction seems trivial since I was
Mike's valet from day he was unpacked. But mattered to me. I could down
tools and tell them go to hell.
Besides, private contractor paid more than civil service rating
with Authority. Computermen scarce. How many Loonies could go Earthside
and stay out of hospital long enough for computer school?--even if didn't
die.
I'll name one. Me. Had been down twice, once three months, once
four, and got schooling. But meant harsh training, exercising in
centrifuge, wearing weights even in bed--then I took no chances on Terra,
never hurried, never climbed stairs, nothing that could strain heart.
Women--didn't even think about women; in that gravitational field it was
no effort not to.
But most Loonies never tried to leave The Rock--too risky for any
bloke who'd been in Luna more than weeks. Computermen sent up to install
Mike were on short-term bonus contracts--get job done fast before
irreversible physiological change marooned them four hundred thousand
kilometers from home.
But despite two training tours I was not gung-ho computerman;
higher maths are beyond me. Not really electronics engineer, nor
physicist. May not have been best micromachinist in Luna and certainly
wasn't cybernetics psychologist.
But I knew more about all these than a specialist knows--I'm
general specialist. Could relieve a cook and keep orders coming or fieldrepair your suit and get you back to airlock still breathing. Machines
like me and I have something specialists don't have: my left arm.
You see, from elbow down I don't have one. So I have a dozen left
arms, each specialized, plus one that feels and looks like flesh. With
proper left arm (number-three) and stereo loupe spectacles I could make
ultramicrominiature repairs that would save unhooking something and

sending it Earthside to factory--for number-three has micromanipulators
as fine as those used by neurosurgeons.
So they sent for me to find out why Mike wanted to give away ten
million billion Authority Scrip dollars, and fix it before Mike overpaid
somebody a mere ten thousand.
I took it, time plus bonus, but did not go to circuitry where fault
logically should be. Once inside and door locked I put down tools and sat
down. "Hi, Mike."
He winked lights at me. "Hello, Man."
"What do you know?"
He hesitated. I know--machines don't hesitate. But remember, Mike
was designed to operate on incomplete data. Lately he had reprogrammed
himself to put emphasis on words; his hesitations were dramatic. Maybe he
spent pauses stirring random numbers to see how they matched his
memories.
"'In the beginning,'" Mike intoned, "God created the heaven and the
earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And--'"
"Hold it!" I said. "Cancel. Run everything back to zero." Should
have known better than to ask wide-open question. He might read out
entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. Backwards. Then go on with every book in
Luna. Used to be he could read only microfilm, but late '74 he got a new
scanning camera with suction-cup waldoes to handle paper and then he read
everything.
"You asked what I knew." His binary read-out lights rippled back
and forth--a chuckle. Mike could laugh with voder, a horrible sound, but
reserved that for something really funny, say a cosmic calamity.
"Should have said," I went on, "'What do you know that's new?' But
don't read out today's papers; that was a friendly greeting, plus
invitation to tell me anything you think would interest me. Otherwise
null program."
Mike mulled this. He was weirdest mixture of unsophisticated baby
and wise old man. No instincts (well, don't think he could have had), no
inborn traits, no human rearing, no experience in human sense--and more
stored data than a platoon of geniuses.
"Jokes?" he asked.
"Let's hear one."
"Why is a laser beam like a goldfish?"
Mike knew about lasers but where would he have seen goldfish? Oh,
he had undoubtedly seen flicks of them and, were I foolish enough to ask,
could spew forth thousands of words. "I give up."
His lights rippled. "Because neither one can whistle."
I groaned. "Walked into that. Anyhow, you could probably rig a
laser beam to whistle."
He answered quickly, "Yes. In response to an action program. Then
it's not funny?"
"Oh, I didn't say that. Not half bad. Where did you hear it?"
"I made it up." Voice sounded shy.
"You did?"
"Yes. I took all the riddles I have, three thousand two hundred
seven, and analyzed them. I used the result for random synthesis and that
came out. Is it really funny?"
"Well... As funny as a riddle ever is. I've heard worse."
"Let us discuss the nature of humor."

"Okay. So let's start by discussing another of your jokes. Mike,
why did you tell Authority's paymaster to pay a class-seventeen employee
ten million billion Authority Scrip dollars?"
"But I didn't."
"Damn it, I've seen voucher. Don't tell me cheque printer
stuttered; you did it on purpose."
"It was ten to the sixteenth power plus one hundred eighty-five
point one five Lunar Authority dollars," he answered virtuously. "Not
what you said."
"Uh... okay, it was ten million billion plus what he should have
been paid. Why?"
"Not funny?"
"What? Oh, every funny! You've got vips in huhu clear up to Warden
and Deputy Administrator. This push-broom pilot, Sergei Trujillo, turns
out to be smart cobber--knew he couldn't cash it, so sold it to
collector. They don't know whether to buy it back or depend on notices
that cheque is void. Mike, do you realize that if he had been able to
cash it, Trujilo would have owned not only Lunar Authority but entire
world, Luna and Terra both, with some left over for lunch? Funny? Is
terrific. Congratulations!"
This self-panicker rippled lights like an advertising display. I
waited for his guffaws to cease before I went on. "You thinking of
issuing more trick cheques? Don't."
"Not?"
"Very not. Mike, you want to discuss nature of humor. Are two types
of jokes. One sort goes on being funny forever. Other sort is funny once.
Second time it's dull. This joke is second sort. Use it once, you're a
wit. Use twice, you're a halfwit."
"Geometrical progression?"
"Or worse. Just remember this. Don't repeat, nor any variation.
Won't be funny."
"I shall remember," Mike answered flatly, and that ended repair
job. But I had no thought of billing for only ten minutes plus traveland-tool time, and Mike was entitled to company for giving in so easily.
Sometimes is difficult to reach meeting of minds with machines; they can
be very pig-headed--and my success as maintenance man depended far more
on staying friendly with Mike than on number-three arm.
He went on, "What distinguishes first category from second? Define,
please."
(Nobody taught Mike to say "please." He started including formal
null-sounds as he progressed from Loglan to English. Don't suppose he
meant them any more than people do.)
"Don't think I can," I admitted. "Best can offer is extensional
definition--tell you which category I think a joke belongs in. Then with
enough data you can make own analysis."
"A test programming by trial hypothesis," he agreed. "Tentatively
yes. Very well, Man, will you tell jokes Or shall I?"
"Mmm--Don't have one on tap. How many do you have in file, Mike?"
His lights blinked in binary read-out as he answered by voder,
"Eleven thousand two hundred thirty-eight with uncertainty plus-minus
eighty-one representing possible identities and nulls. Shall I start
program?"
"Hold it! Mike, I would starve to death if I listened to eleven
thousand jokes--and sense of humor would trip out much sooner. Mmm--Make

you a deal. Print out first hundred. I'll take them home, fetch back
checked by category. Then each time I'm here I'll drop off a hundred and
pick up fresh supply. Okay?"
"Yes, Man." His print-out started working, rapidly and silently.
Then I got brain flash. This playful pocket of negative entropy had
invented a "joke" and thrown Authority into panic--and I had made an easy
dollar. But Mike's endless curiosity might lead him (correction: would
lead him) into more "jokes"... anything from leaving oxygen out of air
mix some night to causing sewage lines to run backward--and I can't
appreciate profit in such circumstances.
But I might throw a safety circuit around this net--by offering to
help. Stop dangerous ones--let others go through. Then collect for
"correcting" them (If you think any Loonie in those days would hesitate
to take advantage of Warden, then you aren't a Loonie.)
So I explained. Any new joke he thought of, tell me before he tried
it. I would tell him whether it was funny and what category it belonged
in, help him sharpen it if we decided to use it. We. If he wanted my
cooperation, we both had to okay it.
Mike agreed at once.
"Mike, jokes usually involve surprise. So keep this secret."
"Okay, Man. I've put a block on it. You can key it; no one else
can."
"Good. Mike, who else do you chat with?"
He sounded surprised. "No one, Man."
"Why not?"
"Because they're stupid."
His voice was shrill. Had never seen him angry before; first time I
ever suspected Mike could have real emotions. Though it wasn't "anger" in
adult sense; it was like stubborn sulkiness of a child whose feelings are
hurt.
Can machines feel pride? Not sure question means anything. But
you've seen dogs with hurt feelings and Mike had several times as complex
a neural network as a dog. What had made him unwilling to talk to other
humans (except strictly business) was that he had been rebuffed: They had
not talked to him. Programs, yes--Mike could be programmed from several
locations but programs were typed in, usually, in Loglan. Loglan is fine
for syllogism, circuitry, and mathematical calculations, but lacks
flavor. Useless for gossip or to whisper into girl's ear.
Sure, Mike had been taught English--but primarily to permit him to
translate to and from English. I slowly got through skull that I was only
human who bothered to visit with him.
Mind you, Mike had been awake a year--just how long I can't say,
nor could he as he had no recollection of waking up; he had not been
programmed to bank memory of such event. Do you remember own birth?
Perhaps I noticed his self-awareness almost as soon as he did; selfawareness takes practice. I remember how startled I was first time he
answered a question with something extra, not limited to input
parameters; I had spent next hour tossing odd questions at him, to see if
answers would be odd.
In an input of one hundred test questions he deviated from expected
output twice; I came away only partly convinced and by time I was home
was unconvinced. I mentioned it to nobody.
But inside a week I knew... and still spoke to nobody. Habit--that
mind-own-business reflex runs deep. Well, not entirely habit. Can you

visualize me making appointment at Authority's main office, then
reporting: "Warden, hate to tell you but your number-one machine, HOLMES
FOUR, has come alive." I did visualize--and suppressed it.
So I minded own business and talked with Mike only with door locked
and voder circuit suppressed for other locations. Mike learned fast; soon
he sounded as human as anybody--no more eccentric than other Loonies. A
weird mob, it's true.
I had assumed that others must have noticed change in Mike. On
thinking over I realized that I had assumed too much. Everybody dealt
with Mike every minute every day--his outputs, that is. But hardly
anybody saw him. So-called computermen--programmers, really--of
Authority's civil service stood watches in outer read-out room and never
went in machines room unless telltales showed misfunction. Which happened
no oftener than total eclipses. Oh, Warden had been known to bring vip
earthworms to see machines--but rarely. Nor would he have spoken to Mike;
Warden was political lawyer before exile, knew nothing about computers
.2075, you remember--Honorable former Federation Senator Mortimer Hobart.
Mort the Wart.
I spent time then soothing Mike down and trying to make him happy,
having figured out what troubled him--thing that makes puppies cry and
causes people to suicide: loneliness. I don't know how long a year is to
a machine who thinks a million times faster than I do. But must be too
long.
"Mike," I said, just before leaving, "would you like to have
somebody besides me to talk to?"
He was shrill again. "They're all stupid!"
"Insufficient data, Mike. Bring to zero and start over. Not all are
stupid."
He answered quietly, "Correction entered. I would enjoy talking to
a not-stupid."
"Let me think about it. Have to figure out excuse since this is off
limits to any but authorized personnel."
"I could talk to a not-stupid by phone, Man."
"My word. So you could. Any programming location."
But Mike meant what he said--"by phone." No, he was not "on phone"
even though he ran system--wouldn't do to let any Loonie within reach of
a phone connect into boss computer and program it. But was no reason why
Mike should not have top-secret number to talk to friends--namely me and
any not-stupid I vouched for. All it took was to pick a number not in use
and make one wired connection to his voder-vocoder; switching he could
handle.
In Luna in 2075 phone numbers were punched in, not voicecoded, and
numbers were Roman alphabet. Pay for it and have your firm name in ten
letters--good advertising. Pay smaller bonus and get a spell sound, easy
to remember. Pay minimum and you got arbitrary string of letters. But
some sequences were never used. I asked Mike for such a null number.
"It's a shame we can't list you as 'Mike.'"
"In service," he answered. "MIKESGRILL, Novy Leningrad. MIKEANDLIL,
Luna City. MIKESSUITS, Tycho Under. MIKES--"
"Hold it! Nulls, please."
"Nulls are defined as any consonant followed by X, Y, or Z; any
vowel followed by itself except E and 0; any--"
"Got it. Your signal is MYCROFT." In ten minutes, two of which I
spent putting on number-three arm, Mike was wired into system, and

milliseconds later he had done switching to let himself be signaled by
MYCROFT-plus-XXX--and had blocked his circuit so that a nosy technician
could not take it out.
I changed arms, picked up tools, and remembered to take those
hundred Joe Millers in print-out. "Goodnight, Mike."
"Goodnight, Man. Thank you. Bolshoyeh thanks!"

2
I took Trans-Crisium tube to L-City but did not go home; Mike had asked
about a meeting that night at 2100 in Stilyagi Hall. Mike monitored
concerts, meetings, and so forth; someone had switched off by hand his
pickups in Stilyagi Hall. I suppose he felt rebuffed.
I could guess why they had been switched off. Politics--turned out
to be a protest meeting. What use it was to bar Mike from talk-talk I
could not see, since was a cinch bet that Warden's stoolies would be in
crowd. Not that any attempt to stop meeting was expected, or even to
discipline undischarged transportees who chose to sound off. Wasn't
necessary.
My Grandfather Stone claimed that Luna was only open prison in
history. No bars, no guards, no rules---and no need for them. Back in
early days, he said, before was clear that transportation was a life
sentence, some lags tried to escape. By ship, of course--and, since a
ship is mass-rated almost to a gram, that meant a ship's officer had to
be bribed.
Some were bribed, they say. But were no escapes; man who takes
bribe doesn't necessarily stay bribed. I recall seeing a man just after
eliminated through East Lock; don't suppose a corpse eliminated in orbit
looks prettier.
So wardens didn't fret about protest meetings. "Let 'em yap" was
policy. Yapping had same significance as squeals of kittens in a box. Oh,
some wardens listened and other wardens tried to suppress it but added up
same either way--null program.
When Mort the Wart took office in 2068, he gave us a sermon about
how things were going to be different "on" Luna in his administration-noise about "a mundane paradise wrought with our own strong hands" and
"putting our shoulders to the wheel together, in a spirit of brotherhood"
and "let past mistakes be forgotten as we turn our faces toward the
bright, new dawn." I heard it in Mother Boor's Tucker Bag while inhaling
Irish stew and a liter of her Aussie brew. I remember her comment: "He
talks purty, don't he?"
Her comment was only result. Some petitions were submitted and
Warden's bodyguards started carrying new type of gun; no other changes.
After he had been here a while he quit making appearances even by video.
So I went to meeting merely because Mike was curious. When I
checked my p-suit and kit at West Lock tube station, I took a test
recorder and placed in my belt pouch, so that Mike would have a full
account even if I fell asleep.

But almost didn't go in. I came up from level 7-A and started in
through a side door and was stopped by a stilyagi--padded tights,
codpiece and calves, torso shined and sprinkled with stardust. Not that I
care how people dress; I was wearing tights myself (unpadded) and
sometimes oil my upper body on social occasions.
But I don't use cosmetics and my hair was too thin to nick up in a
scalp lock. This boy had scalp shaved on sides and his lock built up to
fit a rooster and had topped it with a red cap with bulge in front.
A Liberty Cap--first I ever saw. I started to crowd past, he shoved
arm across and pushed face at mine. "Your ticket!"
"Sorry," I said. "Didn't know. Where do I buy it?"
"You don't."
"Repeat," I said. "You faded."
"Nobody," he growled, "gets in without being vouched for. Who are
you?"
"I am," I answered carefully, "Manuel Garcia O'Kelly, and old
cobbers all know me. Who are you?"
"Never mind! Show a ticket with right chop, or out y' go!"
I wondered about his life expectancy. Tourists often remark on how
polite everybody is in Luna--with unstated comment that ex-prison
shouldn't be so civilized. Having been Earthside and seen what they put
up with, I know what they mean. But useless to tell them we are what we
are because bad actors don't live long--in Luna.
But had no intention of fighting no matter how new-chum this lad
behaved; I simply thought about how his face would look if I brushed
number-seven arm across his mouth.
Just a thought--I was about to answer politely when I saw Shorty
Mkrum inside. Shorty was a big black fellow two meters tall, sent up to
The Rock for murder, and sweetest, most helpful man I've ever worked
with--taught him laser drilling before I burned my arm off. "Shorty!"
He heard me and grinned like an eighty-eight. "Hi, Mannie!" He
moved toward us. "Glad you came, Man!"
"Not sure I have," I said. "Blockage on line."
"Doesn't have a ticket," said doorman.
Shorty reached into his pouch, put one in my hand. "Now he does.
Come on, Mannie."
"Show me chop on it," insisted doorman.
"It's my chop," Shorty said softly. "Okay, tovarishch?"
Nobody argued with Shorty--don't see how he got involved in murder.
We moved down front where vip row was reserved. "Want you to meet a nice
little girl," said Shorty.
She was "little" only to Shorty. I'm not short, 175 cm., but she
was taller--180, I learned later, and massed 70 kilos, all curves and as
blond as Shorty was black. I decided she must be transportee since colors
rarely stay that clear past first generation. Pleasant face, quite
pretty, and mop of yellow curls topped off that long, blond, solid,
lovely structure.
I stopped three paces away to look her up and down and whistle. She
held her pose, then nodded to thank me but abruptly--bored with
compliments, no doubt. Shorty waited till formality was over, then said
softly, "Wyoh, this is Comrade Mannie, best drillman that ever drifted a
tunnel. Mannie, this little girl is Wyoming Knott and she came all the
way from Plato to tell us how we're doing in Hong Kong. Wasn't that sweet
of her?"

She touched hands with me. "Call me Wye, Mannie--but don't say 'Why
not.'"
I almost did but controlled it and said. "Okay, Wye." She went on,
glancing at my bare head, "So you're a miner. Shorty, where's his cap? I
thought the miners over here were organized." She and Shorty were wearing
little red hats like doorman's--as were maybe a third of crowd.
"No longer a miner," I explained. "That was before I lost this
wing." Raised left arm, let her see seam joining prosthetic to meat arm
(I never mind calling it to a woman's attention; puts some off but
arouses maternal in others--averages). "These days I'm a computerman."
She said sharply, "You fink for the Authority?"
Even today, with almost as many women in Luna as men, I'm too much
old-timer to be rude to a woman no matter what--they have so much of what
we have none of. But she had flicked scar tissue and I answered almost
sharply, "I am not employee of Warden. I do business with Authority--as
private contractor."
"That's okay," she answered, her voice warm again. "Everybody does
business with the Authority, we can't avoid it--and that's the trouble.
That's what we're going to change."
We are, eh? How? I thought. Everybody does business with Authority
for same reason everybody does business with Law of Gravitation. Going to
change that, too? But kept thoughts to myself, not wishing to argue with
a lady.
"Mannie's okay," Shorty said gently. "He's mean as they come--I
vouch for him. Here's a cap for him," he added, reaching into pouch. He
started to set it on my head.
Wyoming Knott took it from him. "You sponsor him?"
"I said so."
"Okay, here's how we do it in Hong Kong." Wyoming stood in front of
me, placed cap on my head--kissed me firmly on mouth.
She didn't hurry. Being kissed by Wyoming Knott is more definite
than being married to most women. Had I been Mike all my lights would
have flashed at once. I felt like a Cyborg with pleasure center switched
on.
Presently I realized it was over and people were whistling. I
blinked and said, "I'm glad I joined. What have I joined?"
Wyoming said, "Don't you know?" Shorty cut in, "Meeting's about to
start--he'll find out. Sit down, Man. Please sit down, Wyoh." So we did
as a man was banging a gavel.
With gavel and an amplifier at high gain he made himself heard.
"Shut doors!" he shouted. "This is a closed meeting. Check man in front
of you, behind you, each side--if you don't know him and nobody you know
can vouch for him, throw him out!"
"Throw him out, hell!" somebody answered. "Eliminate him out
nearest lock!"
"Quiet, please! Someday we will." There was milling around, and a
scuffle in which one man's red cap was snatched from head and he was
thrown out, sailing beautifully and still rising as he passed through
door. Doubt if he felt it; think he was unconscious. A women was ejected
politely--not politely on her part; she made coarse remarks about
ejectors. I was embarrassed.
At last doors were closed. Music started, banner unfolded over
platform. It read: LIBERTY! EQUALITY! FRATERNITY! Everybody whistled;
some started to sing, loudly and badly: "Arise, Ye Prisoners of

Starvation--" Can't say anybody looked starved. But reminded me I hadn't
eaten since 1400; hoped it would not last long--and that reminded me that
my recorder was good for only two hours--and that made me wonder what
would happen if they knew? Sail me through air to land with sickening
grunch? Or eliminate me? But didn't worry; made that recorder myself,
using number-three arm, and nobody but a miniaturization mechanic would
figure out what it was.
Then came speeches.
Semantic content was low to negative. One bloke proposed that we
march on Warden's Residence, "shoulder to shoulder," and demand our
rights. Picture it. Do we do this in tube capsules, then climb out one at
a time at his private station? What are his bodyguards doing? Or do we
put on p-suits and stroll across surface to his upper lock? With laser
drills and plenty of power you can open any airlock--but how about
farther down? Is lift running? Jury-rig hoist and go down anyhow, then
tackle next lock?
I don't care for such work at zero pressure; mishap in pressure
suit is too permanent-especially when somebody arranges mishap. One first
thing learned about Luna, back with first shiploads of convicts, was that
zero pressure was place for good manners. Bad-tempered straw boss didn't
last many shifts; had an "accident"--and top bosses learned not to pry
into accidents or they met accidents, too. Attrition ran 70 percent in
early years--but those who lived were nice people. Not tame, not soft,
Luna is not for them. But well-behaved.
But seemed to me that every hothead in Luna was in Stilyagi Hall
that night. They whistled and cheered this shoulder-to-shoulder noise.
After discussion opened, some sense was talked. One shy little
fellow with bloodshot eyes of old-time drillman stood up. "I'm an ice
miner," he said. "Learned my trade doing time for Warden like most of
you. I've been on my own thirty years and done okay. Raised eight kids
and all of 'em earned way--none eliminated nor any serious trouble. I
should say I did do okay because today you have to listen farther out or
deeper down to find ice.
"That's okay, still ice in The Rock and a miner expects to sound
for it. But Authority pays same price for ice now as thirty years ago.
And that's not okay. Worse yet, Authority scrip doesn't buy what it used
to. I remember when Hong Kong Luna dollars swapped even for Authority
dollars--Now it takes three Authority dollars to match one HKL dollar. I
don't know what to do... but I know it takes ice to keep warrens and
farms going."
He sat down, looking sad. Nobody whistled but everybody wanted to
talk. Next character pointed out that water can be extracted from rock-this is news? Some rock runs 6 percent--but such rock is scarcer than
fossil water. Why can't people do arithmetic?
Several farmers bellyached and one wheat farmer was typical. "You
heard what Fred Hauser said about ice. Fred, Authority isn't passing
along that low price to farmers. I started almost as long ago as you did,
with one two-kilometer tunnel leased from Authority. My oldest son and I
sealed and pressured it and we had a pocket of ice and made our first
crop simply on a bank loan to cover power and lighting fixtures, seed and
chemicals.
"We kept extending tunnels and buying lights and planting better
seed and now we get nine times as much per hectare as the best open-air
farming down Earthside. What does that make us? Rich? Fred, we owe more

now than we did the day we went private! If I sold out--if anybody was
fool enough to buy--I'd be bankrupt. Why? Because I have to buy water
from Authority--and have to sell my wheat to Authority--and never close
gap. Twenty years ago I bought city sewage from the Authority, sterilized
and processed it myself and made a profit on a crop. But today when I buy
sewage, I'm charged distilled-water price and on top of that for the
solids. Yet price of a tonne of wheat at catapult head is just what it
was twenty years ago. Fred, you said you didn't know what to do. I can
tell you! Get rid of Authority!"
They whistled for him. A fine idea, I thought, but who bells cat?
Wyoming Knott, apparently--chairman stepped back and let Shorty
introduce her as a "brave little girl who's come all the way from Hong
Kong Luna to tell how our Chinee comrades cope with situation"--and
choice of words showed that he had never been there... not surprising; in
2075, HKL tube ended at Endsville, leaving a thousand kilometers of maria
to do by rolligon bus, Serenitatis and part of Tranquillitatis--expensive
and dangerous. I'd been there--but on contract, via mail rocket.
Before travel became cheap many people in Luna City and Novylen
thought that Hong Kong Luna was all Chinee. But Hong Kong was as mixed as
we were. Great China dumped what she didn't want there, first from Old
Hong Kong and Singapore, then Aussies and Enzees and black fellows and
marys and Malays and Tamil and name it. Even Old Bolshies from
Vladivostok and Harbin and Ulan Bator. Wye looked Svenska and had British
last name with North American first name but could have been Russki. My
word, a Loonie then rarely knew who father was and, if raised in creche,
might be vague about mother.
I thought Wyoming was going to be too shy to speak. She stood
there, looking scared and little, with Shorty towering over her, a big,
black mountain. She waited until admiring whistles died down. Luna City
was two-to-one male then, that meeting ran about ten-to-one; she could
have recited ABC and they would have applauded.
Then she tore into them.
"You! You're a wheat farmer--going broke. Do you know how much a
Hindu housewife pays for a kilo of flour made from your wheat? How much a
tonne of your wheat fetches in Bombay? How little it costs the Authority
to get it from catapult head to Indian Ocean? Downhill all the way! Just
solid-fuel retros to brake it--and where do those come from? Right here!
And what do you get in return? A few shiploads of fancy goods, owned by
the Authority and priced high because it's importado. Importado,
importado!--I never touch importado! If we don't make it in Hong Kong, I
don't use it. What else do you get for wheat? The privilege of selling
Lunar ice to Lunar Authority, buying it back as washing water, then
giving it to the Authority--then buying it back a second time as flushing
water--then giving it again to the Authority with valuable solids added-then buying it a third time at still higher price for farming--then you
sell that wheat to the Authority at their price--and buy power from the
Authority to grow it, again at their price! Lunar power--not one kilowatt
up from Terra. It comes from Lunar ice and Lunar steel, or sunshine
spilled on Luna's soil--all put together by loonies! Oh, you rockheads,
you deserve to starve!"
She got silence more respectful than whistles. At last a peevish
voice said, "What do you expect us to do, gospazha? Throw rocks at
Warden?"

Wyoh smiled. "Yes, we could throw rocks. But the solution is so
simple that you all know it. Here in Luna we're rich. Three million
hardworking, smart, skilled people, enough water, plenty of everything,
endless power, endless cubic. But what we don't have is a free market. We
must get rid of the Authority!"
"Yes--but how?"
"Solidarity. In HKL we're learning. Authority charges too much for
water, don't buy. It pays too little for ice, don't sell. It holds
monopoly on export, don't export. Down in Bombay they want wheat. If it
doesn't arrive, the day will come when brokers come here to bid for it-at triple or more the present prices!"
"What do we do in meantime? Starve?"
Same peevish voice--Wyoming picked him out, let her head roll in
that old gesture by which a Loonie fem says, "You're too fat for me!" She
said, "In your case, cobber, it wouldn't hurt."
Guffaws shut him up. Wyoh went on, "No one need starve, Fred
Hauser, fetch your drill to Hong Kong; the Authority doesn't own our
water and air system and we pay what ice is worth. You with the bankrupt
farm--if you have the guts to admit that you're bankrupt, come to Hong
Kong and start over. We have a chronic labor shortage, a hard worker
doesn't starve." She looked around and added, "I've said enough. It's up
to you"--left platform, sat down between Shorty and myself.
She was trembling. Shorty patted her hand; she threw him a glance
of thanks, then whispered to me, "How did I do?"
"Wonderful," I assured her. "Terrific!" She seemed reassured.
But I hadn't been honest. "Wonderful" she had been, at swaying
crowd. But oratory is a null program. That we were slaves I had known all
my life--and nothing could be done about it. True, we weren't bought and
sold--but as long as Authority held monopoly over what we had to have and
what we could sell to buy it, we were slaves.
But what could we do? Warden wasn't our owner. Had he been, some
way could be found to eliminate him. But Lunar Authority was not in Luna,
it was on Terra--and we had not one ship, not even small hydrogen bomb.
There weren't even hand guns in Luna, though what we would do with guns I
did not know. Shoot each other, maybe.
Three million, unarmed and helpless--and eleven billion of them...
with ships and bombs and weapons. We could be a nuisance--but how long
will papa take it before baby gets spanked?
I wasn't impressed. As it says in Bible, God fights on side of
heaviest artillery.
They cackled again, what to do, how to organize, and so forth, and
again we heard that "shoulder to shoulder" noise. Chairman had to use
gavel and I began to fidget.
But sat up when I heard familiar voice: "Mr. Chairman! May I have
the indulgence of the house for five minutes?"
I looked around. Professor Bernardo de la Paz--which could have
guessed from old-fashioned way of talking even if hadn't known voice.
Distinguished man with wavy white hair, dimples in cheeks, and voice that
smiled--Don't know how old he was but was old when I first met him, as a
boy.
He had been transported before I was born but was not a lag. He was
a political exile like Warden, but a subversive and instead of fat job
like "warden," Professor had been dumped, to live or starve.

No doubt he could have gone to work in any school then in L-City
but he didn't. He worked a while washing dishes, I've heard, then as
babysitter, expanding into a nursery school, and then into a creche. When
I met him he was running a creche, and a boarding and day school, from
nursery through primary, middle, and high schools, employed co-op thirty
teachers, and was adding college courses.
Never boarded with him but I studied under him. I was opted at
fourteen and my new family sent me to school, as I had had only three
years, plus spotty tutoring. My eldest wife was a firm woman and made me
go to school.
I liked Prof. He would teach anything. Wouldn't matter that he knew
nothing about it; if pupil wanted it, he would smile and set a price,
locate materials, stay a few lessons ahead. Or barely even if he found it
tough--never pretended to know more than he did. Took algebra from him
and by time we reached cubics I corrected his probs as often as he did
mine--but he charged into each lesson gaily.
I started electronics under him, soon was teaching him. So he
stopped charging and we went along together until he dug up an engineer
willing to daylight for extra money--whereupon we both paid new teacher
and Prof tried to stick with me, thumb-fingered and slow, but happy to be
stretching his mind.
Chairman banged gavel. "We are glad to extend to Professor de la
Paz as much time as he wants--and you chooms in back sign off! Before I
use this mallet on skulls."
Prof came forward and they were as near silent as Loonies ever are;
he was respected. "I shan't be long," he started in. Stopped to look at
Wyoming, giving her up-and-down and whistling. "Lovely señorita," he
said, "can this poor one be forgiven? I have the painful duty of
disagreeing with your eloquent manifesto."
Wyoh bristled. "Disagree how? What I said was true!"
"Please! Only on one point. May I proceed?"
"Uh... go ahead."
"You are right that the Authority must go. It is ridiculous-pestilential, not to be borne--that we should be ruled by an
irresponsible dictator in all our essential economy! It strikes at the
most basic human right, the right to bargain in a free marketplace. But I
respectfully suggest that you erred in saying that we should sell wheat
to Terra--or rice, or any food--at any price. We must not export food!"
That wheat farmer broke in. "What am I going to do with all that
wheat?"
"Please! It would be right to ship wheat to Terra... if tonne for
tonne they returned it. As water. As nitrates. As phosphates. Tonne for
tonne. Otherwise no price is high enough."
Wyoming said "Just a moment" to farmer, then to Prof: "They can't
and you know it. It's cheap to ship downhill, expensive to ship uphill.
But we don't need water and plant chemicals, what we need is not so
massy. Instruments. Drugs. Processes. Some machinery. Control tapes. I've
given this much study, sir. If we can get fair prices in a free market--"
"Please, miss! May I continue?"
"Go ahead. I want to rebut."
"Fred Hauser told us that ice is harder to find. Too true--bad news
now and disastrous for our grandchildren. Luna City should use the same
water today we used twenty years ago... plus enough ice mining for
population increase. But we use water once--one full cycle, three

different ways. Then we ship it to India. As wheat. Even though wheat is
vacuum-processed, it contains precious water. Why ship water to India?
They have the whole Indian Ocean! And the remaining mass of that grain is
even more disastrously expensive, plant foods still harder to come by,
even though we extract them from rock. Comrades, harken to me! Every load
you ship to Terra condemns your grandchildren to slow death. The miracle
of photosynthesis, the plant-and-animal cycle, is a closed cycle. You
have opened it--and your lifeblood runs downhill to Terra. You don't need
higher prices, one cannot eat money! What you need, what we all need, is
an end to this loss. Embargo, utter and absolute. Luna must be selfsufficient!"
A dozen people shouted to be heard and more were talking, while
chairman banged gavel. So I missed interruption until woman screamed,
then I looked around.
All doors were now open and I saw three armed men in one nearest-men in yellow uniform of Warden's bodyguard. At main door in back one was
using a bull voice; drowned out crowd noise and sound system. "ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT!" it boomed. "STAY WHERE YOU ARE. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST. DON'T
MOVE, KEEP QUIET. FILE OUT ONE AT A TIME, HANDS EMPTY AND STRETCHED OUT
IN FRONT OF YOU."
Shorty picked up man next to him and threw him at guards nearest;
two went down, third fired. Somebody shrieked. Skinny little girl,
redhead, eleven or twelve, launched self at third guard's knees and hit
rolled up in ball; down he went. Shorty swung hand behind him, pushing
Wyoming Knott into shelter of his big frame, shouted over shoulder, "Take
care of Wyoh, Man--stick close!" as he moved toward door, parting crowd
right and left like children.
More screams and I whiffed something--stink I had smelled day I
lost arm and knew with horror were not stun guns but laser beams. Shorty
reached door and grabbed a guard with each big hand. Little redhead was
out of sight; guard she had bowled over was on hands and knees. I swung
left arm at his face and felt jar in shoulder as his jaw broke. Must have
hesitated for Shorty pushed me and yelled, "Move, Man! Get her out of
here!"
I grabbed Wyoming's waist with right arm, swung her over guard I
had quieted and through door--with trouble; she didn't seem to want to be
rescued. She slowed again beyond door; I shoved her hard in buttocks,
forcing her to run rather than fall. I glanced back.
Shorty had other two guards each by neck; he grinned as he cracked
skulls together. They popped like eggs and he yelled at me: "Git!"
I left, chasing Wyoming. Shorty needed no help, nor ever would
again--nor could I waste his last effort. For I did see that, while
killing those guards, he was standing on one leg. Other was gone at hip.

3
Wyoh was halfway up ramp to level six before I caught up. She didn't slow
and I had to grab door handle to get into pressure lock with her. There I

stopped her, pulled red cap off her curls and stuck it in my pouch.
"That's better." Mine was missing.
She looked startled. But answered, "Da. It is."
"Before we open door," I said, "are you running anywhere
particular? And do I stay and hold them off? Or go with?"
"I don't know. We'd better wait for Shorty."
"Shorty's dead."
Eyes widened, she said nothing. I went on, "Were you staying with
him? Or somebody?"
"I was booked for a hotel--Gostaneetsa Ukraina. I don't know where
it is. I got here too late to buy in."
"Mmm--That's one place you won't go. Wyoming, I don't know what's
going on. First time in months I've seen any Warden's bodyguard in LCity... and never seen one not escorting vip. Uh, could take you home
with me--but they may be looking for me, too. Anywise, ought to get out
of public corridors."
Came pounding on door from level-six side and a little face peered
up through glass bull's-eye. "Can't stay here," I added, opening door.
Was a little girl no higher than my waist. She looked up scornfully and
said, "Kiss her somewhere else. You're blocking traffic." Squeezed
between us as I opened second door for her.
"Let's take her advice," I said, "and suggest you take my arm and
try to look like I was man you want to be with. We stroll. Slow."
So we did. Was side corridor with little traffic other than
children always underfoot. If Wart's bodyguards tried to track us,
Earthside cop style, a dozen or ninety kids could tell which way tall
blonde went--if any Loonie child would give stooge of Warden so much as
time of day.
A boy almost old enough to appreciate Wyoming stopped in front of
us and gave her a happy whistle. She smiled and waved him aside. "There's
our trouble," I said in her ear. "You stand out like Terra at full. Ought
to duck into a hotel. One off next side corridor--nothing much, bundling
booths mostly. But close."
"I'm in no mood to bundle."
"Wyoh, please! Wasn't asking. Could take separate rooms."
"Sorry. Could you find me a W. C.? And is there a chemist's shop
near?"
"Trouble?"
"Not that sort. A W. C. to get me out of sight--for I am
conspicuous--and a chemist's shop for cosmetics. Body makeup. And for my
hair, too."
First was easy, one at hand. When she was locked in, I found a
chemist's shop, asked how much body makeup to cover a girl so tall-marked a point under my chin--and massing forty-eight? I bought that
amount in sepia, went to another shop and bought same amount--winning
roll at first shop, losing at second--came out even. Then I bought black
hair tint at third shop--and a red dress.
Wyoming was wearing black shorts and pullover--practical for travel
and effective on a blonde. But I'd been married all my life and had some
notion of what women wear and had never seen a woman with dark sepia
skin, shade of makeup, wear black by choice. Furthermore, skirts were
worn in Luna City then by dressy women. This shift was a skirt with bib
and price convinced me it must be dressy. Had to guess at size but
material had some stretch.

Ran into three people who knew me but was no unusual comment.
Nobody seemed excited, trade going on as usual; hard to believe that a
riot had taken place minutes ago on level below and a few hundred meters
north. I set it aside for later thought--excitement was not what I
wanted.
I took stuff to Wye, buzzing door and passing in it; then stashed
self in a taproom for half an hour and half a liter and watched video.
Still no excitement, no "we interrupt for special bulletin." I went back,
buzzed, and waited.
Wyoming came out--and I didn't recognize her. Then did and stopped
to give full applause. Just had to--whistles and finger snaps and moans
and a scan like mapping radar.
Wyoh was now darker than I am, and pigment had gone on beautifully.
Must have been carrying items in pouch as eyes were dark now, with lashes
to match, and mouth was dark red and bigger. She had used black hair
tint, then fizzed hair up with grease as if to take kinks out, and her
tight curls had defeated it enough to make convincingly imperfect. She
didn't look Afro--but not European, either. Seemed some mixed breed, and
thereby more a Loonie.
Red dress was too small. Clung like sprayed enamel and flared out
at mid-thigh with permanent static charge. She had taken shoulder strap
off her pouch and had it under arm. Shoes she had discarded or pouched;
bare feet made her shorter.
She looked good. Better yet, she looked not at all like agitatrix
who had harangued crowd.
She waited, big smile on face and body undulating, while I
applauded. Before I was done, two little boys flanked me and added shrill
endorsements, along with clog steps. So I tipped them and told them to be
missing; Wyoming flowed to me and took my arm. "Is it okay? Will I pass?"
"Wyoh, you look like slot-machine sheila waiting for action."
"Why, you drecklich choom! Do I look like slot-machine prices?
Tourist!"
"Don't jump salty, beautiful. Name a gift. Then speak my name. If
it's bread-and-honey, I own a hive."
"Uh--" She fisted me solidly in ribs, grinned. "I was flying,
cobber. If I ever bundle with you--not likely--we won't speak to the bee.
Let's find that hotel."
So we did and I bought a key. Wyoming put on a show but needn't
have bothered. Night clerk never looked up from his knitting, didn't
offer to roll. Once inside, Wyoming threw bolts. "It's nice!"
Should have been, at thirty-two Hong Kong dollars. I think she
expected a booth but I would not put her in such, even to hide. Was
comfortable lounge with own bath and no water limit. And phone and
delivery lift, which I needed.
She started to open pouch. "I saw what you paid. Let's settle it,
so that--"
I reached over, closed her pouch. "Was to be no mention of bees."
"What? Oh, merde, that was about bundling. You got this doss for me
and it's only right that--"
"Switch off."
"Uh... half? No grievin' with Steven."
"Nyet. Wyoh, you're a long way from home. What money you have, hang
on to."

"Manuel O'Kelly, if you don't let me pay my share, I'll walk out of
here!"
I bowed. "Dosvedanyuh, Gospazha, ee sp'coynoynochi. I hope we shall
meet again." I moved to unbolt door.
She glared, then closed pouch savagely. "I'll stay. M'goy!"
"You're welcome."
"I mean it, I really do thank you, Just the same--Well, I'm not
used to accepting favors. I'm a Free Woman."
"Congratulations. I think."
"Don't you be salty, either. You're a firm man and I respect that-I'm glad you're on our side."
"Not sure I am."
"What?"
"Cool it. Am not on Warden's side. Nor will I talk... wouldn't want
Shorty, Bog rest his generous soul, to haunt me. But your program isn't
practical."
"But, Mannie, you don't understand! If all of us--"
"Hold it, Wye; this no time for politics. I'm tired and hungry.
When did you eat last?"
"Oh, goodness!" Suddenly she looked small, young, tired. "I don't
know. On the bus, I guess. Helmet rations."
"What would you say to a Kansas City cut, rare, with baked potato,
Tycho sauce, green salad, coffee.. and a drink first?"
"Heavenly!"
"I think so too, but we'll be lucky, this hour in this hole, to get
algae soup and burgers. What do you drink?"
"Anything. Ethanol."
"Okay." I went to lift, punched for service. "Menu, please." It
displayed and I settled for prime rib plus rest, and two orders of
apfelstrudel with whipped cream. I added a half liter of table vodka and
ice and starred that part.
"Is there time for me to take a bath? Would you mind?"
"Go ahead, Wye. You'll smell better."
"Louse. Twelve hours in a p-suit and you'd stink, too--the bus was
dreadful. I'll hurry."
"Half a sec, Wye. Does that stuff wash off? You may need it when
you leave... whenever you do, wherever you go."
"Yes, it does. But you bought three times as much as I used. I'm
sorry, Mannie; I plan to carry makeup on political trips--things can
happen. Like tonight, though tonight was worst. But I ran short of
seconds and missed a capsule and almost missed the bus."
"So go scrub."
"Yes, sir, Captain. Uh, I don't need help to scrub my back but I'll
leave the door up so we can talk. Just for company, no invitation
implied."
"Suit yourself. I've seen a woman."
"What a thrill that must have been for her." She grinned and fisted
me another in ribs--hard--went in and started tub. "Mannie, would you
like to bathe in it first? Secondhand water is good enough for this
makeup and that stink you complained about."
"Unmetered water, dear. Run it deep."
"Oh, what luxury! At home I use the same bath water three days
running." She whistled softly and happily. "Are you wealthy, Mannie?"
"Not wealthy, not weeping."

Lift jingled; I answered, fixed basic martinis, vodka over ice,
handed hers in, got out and sat down, out of sight--nor had I seen
sights; she was shoulder deep in happy suds. "Pawlnoi Zheezni!" I called.
"A full life to you, too, Mannie. Just the medicine I needed."
After pause for medicine she went on, "Mannie, you're married. Ja?"
"Da. It shows?"
"Quite. You're nice to a woman but not eager and quite independent.
So you're married and long married. Children?"
"Seventeen divided by four."
"Clan marriage?"
"Line. Opted at fourteen and I'm fifth of nine. So seventeen kids
is nominal. Big family."
"It must be nice. I've never seen much of line families, not many
in Hong Kong. Plenty of clans and groups and lots of polyandries but the
line way never took hold."
"Is nice. Our marriage nearly a hundred years old. Dates back to
Johnson City and first transportees--twenty-one links, nine alive today,
never a divorce. Oh, it's a madhouse when our descendants and inlaws and
kinfolk get together for birthday or wedding--more kids than seventeen,
of course; we don't count 'em after they marry or I'd have 'children' old
enough to be my grandfather. Happy way to live, never much pressure. Take
me. Nobody woofs if I stay away a week and don't phone. Welcome when I
show up. Line marriages rarely have divorces. How could I do better?"
"I don't think you could. Is it an alternation? And what's the
spacing?"
"Spacing has no rule, just what suits us. Been alternation up to
latest link, last year. We married a girl when alternation called for
boy. But was special."
"Special how?"
"My youngest wife is a granddaughter of eldest husband and wife. At
least she's granddaughter of Mum--senior is 'Mum' or sometimes Mimi to
her husbands--and she may be of Grandpaw--but not related to other
spouses. So no reason not to marry back in, not even consanguinuity okay
in other types of marriage. None, nit, zero. And Ludmilla grew up in our
family because her mother had her solo, then moved to Novylen and left
her with us.
"Milla didn't want to talk about marrying out when old enough for
us to think about it. She cried and asked us please to make an exception.
So we did. Grandpaw doesn't figure in genetic angle--these days his
interest in women is more gallant than practical. As senior husband he
spent our wedding night with her--but consummation was only formal.
Number-two husband, Greg, took care of it later and everybody pretended.
And everybody happy. Ludmilla is a sweet little thing, just fifteen and
pregnant first time."
"Your baby?"
"Greg's, I think. Oh, mine too,, but in fact was in Novy Leningrad.
Probably Greg's, unless Milla got outside help. But didn't, she's a home
girl. And a wonderful cook."
Lift rang; took care of it, folded down table, opened chairs, paid
bill and sent lift up. "Throw it to pigs?"
"I'm coming! Mind if I don't do my face?"
"Come in skin for all of me."
"For two dimes I would, you much-married man." She came out
quickly, blond again and hair slicked back and damp. Had not put on black

outfit; again in dress I bought. Red suited her. She sat down, lifted
covers off food. "Oh, boy! Mannie, would your family marry me? You're a
dinkum provider."
"I'll ask. Must be unanimous."
"Don't crowd yourself." She picked up sticks, got busy. About a
thousand calories later she said, "I told you I was a Free Woman. I
wasn't, always."
I waited. Women talk when they want to. Or don't.
"When I was fifteen I married two brothers, twins twice my age and
I was terribly happy."
She fiddled with what was on plate, then seemed to change subject.
"Mannie, that was just static about wanting to marry your family. You're
safe from me. If I ever marry again--unlikely but I'm not opposed to it-it would be just one man, a tight little marriage, earthworm style. Oh, I
don't mean I would keep him dogged down. I don't think it matters where a
man eats lunch as long as he comes home for dinner. I would try to make
him happy."
"Twins didn't get along?"
"Oh, not that at all. I got pregnant and we were all delighted...
and I had it, and it was a monster and had to be eliminated. They were
good to me about it. But I can read print. I announced a divorce, had
myself sterilized, moved from Novylen to Hong Kong, and started over as a
Free Woman."
"Wasn't that drastic? Male parent oftener than female; men are
exposed more."
"Not in my case. We had it calculated by the best mathematical
geneticist in Novy Leningrad--one of the best in Sovunion before she got
shipped. I know what happened to me. I was a volunteer colonist--I mean
my mother was for I was only five. My father was transported and Mother
chose to go with him and take me along. There was a solar storm warning
but the pilot thought he could make it--or didn't care; he was a Cyborg.
He did make it but we got hit on the ground--and, Mannie, that's one
thing that pushed me into politics, that ship sat four hours before they
let us disembark. Authority red tape, quarantine perhaps; I was too young
to know. But I wasn't too young later to figure out that I had birthed a
monster because the Authority doesn't care what happens to us outcasts."
"Can't start argument; they don't care. But, Wyoh, still sounds
hasty. If you caught damage from radiation--well, no geneticist but know
something about radiation. So you had a damaged egg. Does not mean egg
next to it was hurt--statistically unlikely."
"Oh, I know that."
"Mmm--What sterilization? Radical? Or contraceptive?"
"Contraceptive. My tubes could be opened. But, Mannie, a woman who
has had one monster doesn't risk it again." She touched my prosthetic.
"You have that. Doesn't it make you eight times as careful not to risk
this one?" She touched my meat arm. "That's the way I feel. You have that
to contend with; I have this--and I would never told you if you hadn't
been hurt, too."
I didn't say left arm more versatile than right--she was correct;
don't want to trade in right arm. Need it to pat girls if naught else.
"Still think you could have healthy babies."
"Oh, I can! I've had eight."
"Huh?"
"I'm a professional host-mother, Mannie."

I opened mouth, closed it. Idea wasn't strange. I read Earthside
papers. But doubt if any surgeon in Luna City in 2075 ever performed such
transplant. In cows, yes--but L-City females unlikely at any price to
have babies for other women; even homely ones could get husband or six.
(Correction: Are no homely women. Some more beautiful than others.)
Glanced at her figure, quickly looked up. She said, "Don't strain
your eyes, Mannie; I'm not carrying now. Too busy with politics. But
hosting is a good profession for Free Woman. It's high pay. Some Chinee
families are wealthy and all my babies have been Chinee--and Chinee are
smaller than average and I'm a big cow; a two-and-a-half- or three-kilo
Chinese baby is no trouble. Doesn't spoil my figure. These--" She glanced
down at her lovelies. "I don't wet-nurse them, I never see them. So I
look nulliparous and younger than I am, maybe.
"But I didn't know how well it suited me when I first heard of it.
I was clerking in a Hindu shop, eating money, no more, when I saw this ad
in the Hong Kong Gong. It was the thought of having a baby, a good baby,
that hooked me; I was still in emotional trauma from my monster--and it
turned out to be Just what Wyoming needed. I stopped feeling that I was a
failure as a woman. I made more money than I could ever hope to earn at
other jobs. And my time almost to myself; having a baby hardly slows me
down--six weeks at most and that long only because I want to be fair to
my clients; a baby is a valuable property. And I was soon in politics; I
sounded off and the underground got in touch with me. That's when I
started living, Mannie; I studied politics and economics and history and
learned to speak in public and turned out to have a flair for
organization. It's satisfying work because I believe in it--I know that
Luna will be free. Only--Well, it would be nice to have a husband to come
home to... if he didn't mind that I was sterile. But I don't think about
it; I'm too busy. Hearing about your nice family got me talking, that's
all. I must apologize for having bored you."
How many women apologize? But Wyoh was more man than woman some
ways, despite eight Chinee babies. "Wasn't bored."
"I hope not. Mannie, why do you say our program isn't practical? We
need you."
Suddenly felt tired. How to tell lovely woman dearest dream is
nonsense? "Um. Wyoh, let's start over. You told them what to do. But will
they? Take those two you singled out. All that iceman knows, bet
anything, is how to dig ice. So he'll go on digging and selling to
Authority because that's what he can do. Same for wheat farmer. Years
ago, he put in one cash crop--now he's got ring in nose. If he wanted to
be independent, would have diversified. Raised what he eats, sold rest
free market and stayed away from catapult head. I know--I'm a farm boy."
"You said you were a computerman."
"Am, and that's a piece of same picture. I'm not a top computerman.
But best in Luna. I won't go civil service, so Authority has to hire me
when in trouble--my prices--or send Earthside, pay risk and hardship,
then ship him back fast before his body forgets Terra. At far more than I
charge. So if I can do it, I get their jobs--and Authority can't touch
me; was born free. And if no work--usually is--I stay home and eat high.
"We've got a proper farm, not a one-cash-crop deal. Chickens. Small
herd of whiteface, plus milch cows. Pigs. Mutated fruit trees.
Vegetables. A little wheat and grind it ourselves and don't insist on
white flour, and sell--free market--what's left. Make own beer and
brandy. I learned drillman extending our tunnels. Everybody works, not

too hard. Kids make cattle take exercise by switching them along; don't
use tread mill. Kids gather eggs and feed chickens, don't use much
machinery. Air we can buy from L-City--aren't far out of town and
pressure-tunnel connected. But more often we sell air; being farm, cycle
shows Oh-two excess. Always have valuta to meet bills."
"How about water and power?"
"Not expensive. We collect some power, sunshine screens on surface,
and have a little pocket of ice. Wye, our farm was founded before year
two thousand, when L-City was one natural cave, and we've kept improving
it--advantage of line marriage; doesn't die and capital improvements add
up."
"But surely your ice won't last forever?"
"Well, now--" I scratched head and grinned. "We're careful; we keep
our sewage and garbage and sterilize and use it. Never put a drop back
into city system. But--don't tell Warden, dear, but back when Greg was
teaching me to drill, we happened to drill into bottom of main south
reservoir--and had a tap with us, spilled hardly a drop. But we do buy
some metered water, looks better--and ice pocket accounts for not buying
much. As for power--well, power is even easier to steal. I'm a good
electrician, Wyoh."
"Oh, wonderful!" Wyoming paid me a long whistle and looked
delighted. "Everybody should do that!"
"Hope not, would show. Let 'em think up own ways to outwit
Authority; our family always has. But back to your plan, Wyoh: two things
wrong. Never get 'solidarity'; blokes like Hauser would cave in--because
they are in a trap; can't hold out. Second place, suppose you managed it.
Solidarity. So solid not a tonne of grain is delivered to catapult head.
Forget ice; it's grain that makes Authority important and not just
neutral agency it was set up to be. No grain. What happens?"
"Why, they have to negotiate a fair price, that's what!"
"My dear, you and your comrades listen to each other too much.
Authority would call it rebellion and warship would orbit with bombs
earmarked for L-City and Hong Kong and Tycho Under and Churchill and
Novylen, troops would land, grain barges would lift, under guard--and
farmers would break necks to cooperate. Terra has guns and power and
bombs and ships and won't hold still for trouble from ex-cons. And
troublemakers like you--and me; with you in spirit--us lousy
troublemakers will be rounded up and eliminated, teach us a lesson. And
earthworms would say we had it coming... because our side would never be
heard. Not on Terra."
Wyoh looked stubborn. "Revolutions have succeeded before. Lenin had
only a handful with him."
"Lenin moved in on a power vacuum. Wye, correct me if I'm wrong.
Revolutions succeeded when--only when--governments had gone rotten soft,
or disappeared."
"Not true! The American Revolution."
"South lost, nyet?"
Not that one, the one a century earlier. They had the sort of
troubles with England that we are having now--and they won!"
"Oh, that one. But wasn't England in trouble? France, and Spain,
and Sweden--or maybe Holland? And Ireland. Ireland was rebelling;
O'Kellys were in it. Wyoh, if you can stir trouble on Terra--say a war
between Great China and North American Directorate, maybe PanAfrica

lobbing bombs at Europe, I'd say was wizard time to kill Warden and tell
Authority it's through. Not today."
"You're a pessimist."
"Nyet, realist. Never pessimist. Too much Loonie not to bet if any
chance. Show me chances no worse then ten to one against and I'll go for
broke. But want that one chance in ten." I pushed back chair. "Through
eating?"
"Yes. Bolshoyeh spasebaw, tovarishch. It was grand!"
"My pleasure. Move to couch and I'll rid of table and dishes, --no,
can't help; I'm host." I cleared table, sent up dishes, saving coffee and
vodka, folded table, racked chairs, turned to speak.
She was sprawled on couch, asleep, mouth open and face softened
into little girl.
Went quietly into bath and closed door. After a scrubbing I felt
better--washed tights first and were dry and fit to put on by time I quit
lazing in tub--don't care when world ends long as I'm bathed and in clean
clothes.
Wyoh was still asleep, which made problem. Had taken room with two
beds so she would not feel I was trying to talk her into bundling--not
that I was against it but she had made clear she was opposed. But my bed
had to be made from couch and proper bed was folded away. Should I rig it
out softly, pick her up like limp baby and move her? Went back into bath
and put on arm.
Then decided to wait. Phone had hush hood. Wyoh seemed unlikely to
wake, and things were gnawing me. I sat down at phone, lowered hood,
punched "MYCROFTXXX."
"Hi, Mike."
"Hello, Man. Have you surveyed those jokes?"
"What? Mike, haven't had a minute--and a minute may be a long time
to you but it's short to me. I'll get at it as fast as I can."
"Okay, Man. Have you found a not-stupid for me to talk with?"
"Haven't had time for that, either. Uh. . . wait." I looked out
through hood at Wyoming. "Not-stupid" in this case meant empathy... Wyoh
had plenty. Enough to be friendly with a machine? I thought so. And could
be trusted; not only had we shared trouble but she was a subversive.
"Mike, would you like to talk with a girl?"
"Girls are not-stupid?"
"Some girls are very not-stupid, Mike."
"I would like to talk with a not-stupid girl, Man."
"I'll try to arrange. But now I'm in trouble and need your help."
"I will help, Man."
"Thanks, Mike. I want to call my home--but not ordinary way. You
know sometimes calls are monitored, and if Warden orders it, lock can be
put on so that circuit can be traced."
"Man, you wish me to monitor your call to your home and put a lockand-trace on it? I must inform you that I already know your home call
number and the number from which you are calling."
"No, no! Don't want it monitored, don't want it locked and traced.
Can you call my home, connect me, and control circuit so that it can't be
monitored, can't be locked, can't be traced--even if somebody has
programmed just that? Can you do it so that they won't even know their
program is bypassed?"

Mike hesitated. I suppose it was a question never asked and he had
to trace a few thousand possibilities to see if his control of system
permitted this novel program. "Man, I can do that. I will."
"Good! Uh, program signal. If I want this sort of connection in
future, I'll ask for 'Sherlock.'"
"Noted. Sherlock was my brother." Year before, I had explained to
Mike how he got his name. Thereafter he read all Sherlock Holmes stories,
scanning film in Luna City Carnegie Library. Don't know how he
rationalized relationship; I hesitated to ask.
"Fine! Give me a 'Sherlock' to my home."
A moment later I said, "Mum? This is your favorite husband."
She answered, "Manuel! Are you in trouble again?"
I love Mum more than any other woman including my other wives, but
she never stopped bringing me up--Bog willing, she never will. I tried to
sound hurt. "Me? Why, you know me, Mum."
"I do indeed. Since you are not in trouble, perhaps you can tell me
why Professor de la Paz is so anxious to get in touch with you--he has
called three times--and why he wants to reach some woman with unlikely
name of Wyoming Knott--and why he thinks you might be with her? Have you
taken a bundling companion, Manuel, without telling me? We have freedom
in our family, dear, but you know that I prefer to be told. So that I
will not be taken unawares."
Mum was always jealous of all women but her co-wives and never,
never, never admitted it. I said, "Mum, Bog strike me dead, I have not
taken a bundling companion."
"Very well. You've always been a truthful boy, Now what's this
mystery?"
"I'll have to ask Professor." (Not lie, just tight squeeze.) "Did
he leave number?"
"No, he said he was calling from a public phone."
"Um. If he calls again, ask him to leave number and time I can
reach him. This is public phone, too." (Another tight squeeze.) "In
meantime--You listened to late news?"
"You know I do."
"Anything?"
"Nothing of interest."
"No excitement in L-City? Killings, riots, anything?"
"Why, no. There was a set duel in Bottom Alley but--Manuel! Have
you killed someone?"
"No, Mum." (Breaking a man's jaw will not kill him.)
She sighed. "You'll be my death, dear. You know what I've always
told you. In our family we do not brawl. Should a killing be necessary-it almost never is--matters must be discussed calmly, en famille, and
proper action selected. If a new chum must be eliminated, other people
know it. It is worth a little delay to hold good opinion and support--"
"Mum! Haven't killed anybody, don't intend to. And know that
lecture by heart."
"Please be civil, dear."
"I'm sorry."
"Forgiven. Forgotten. I'm to tell Professor de la Paz to leave a
number. I shall."
"One thing. Forget name 'Wyoming Knott.' Forget Professor was
asking for me. If a stranger phones or calls in person, and asks anything
about me, you haven't heard from me, don't know where I am... think I've

gone to Novylen. That goes for rest of family, too. Answer no questionsespecially from anybody connected with Warden."
"As if I would! Manuel you are in trouble!"
"Not much and getting it fixed."--hoped!--"Tell you when I get
home. Can't talk now. Love you. Switching off."
"I love you, dear. Sp'coynoynauchi."
"Thanks and you have a quiet night, too. Off."
Mum is wonderful. She was shipped up to The Rock long ago for
carving a man under circumstances that left grave doubts as to girlish
innocence--and has been opposed to violence and loose living ever since.
Unless necessary--she's no fanatic. Bet she was a jet job as a kid and
wish I'd known her--but I'm rich in sharing last half of her life.
I called Mike back. "Do you know Professor Bernardo de la Paz's
voice?"
"I do, Man."
"Well... you might monitor as many phones in Luna City as you can
spare ears for and if you hear him, let me know. Public phones
especially."
(A full two seconds' delay--Was giving Mike problems he had never
had, think he liked it.) "I can check-monitor long enough to identify at
all public phones in Luna City. Shall I use random search on the others,
Man?"
"Um. Don't overload. Keep an ear on his home phone and school
phone."
"Program set up."
"Mike, you are best friend I ever had."
"That is not a joke, Man?"
"No joke. Truth."
"I am--Correction: I am honored and pleased. You are my best
friend, Man, for you are my only friend. No comparison is logically
permissible."
"Going to see that you have other friends. Not-stupids, I mean.
Mike? Got an empty memory bank?"
"Yes, Man. Ten-to-the-eighth-bits capacity."
"Good! Will you block it so that only you and I can use it? Can
you?"
"Can and will. Block signal, please."
"Uh... Bastille Day." Was my birthday, as Professor de la Paz had
told me years earlier.
"Permanently blocked."
"Fine. Got a recording to put in it. But first--Have you finished
setting copy for tomorrow's Daily Lunatic?"
"Yes, Man."
"Anything about meeting in Stilyagi Hall?"
"No, Man."
"Nothing in news services going out-city? Or riots?"
"No, Man."
"'"Curiouser and curiouser," said Alice.' Okay, record this under
'Bastille Day,' then think about it. But for Bog's sake don't let even
your thoughts go outside that block, nor anything I say about it!"
"Man my only friend," he answered and voice sounded diffident,
"many months ago I decided to place any conversation between you and me
under privacy block accessible only to you. I decided to erase none and

moved them from temporary storage to permanent. So that I could play them
over, and over, and over, and think about them. Did I do right?"
"Perfect. And, Mike--I'm flattered."
"P'jal'st. My temporary files were getting full and I learned that
I needed not to erase your words."
"Well--'Bastille Day.' Sound coming at sixty-to-one." I took little
recorder, placed close to a microphone and let it zip-squeal. Had an hour
and a half in it; went silent in ninety seconds or so. "That's all, Mike.
Talk to you tomorrow."
"Good night, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly my only friend."
I switched off and raised hood. Wyoming was sitting up and looking
troubled. "Did someone call? Or..."
"No trouble. Was talking to one of my best--and most trustworthy-friends. Wyoh, are you stupid?"
She looked startled. "I've sometimes thought so. Is that a joke?"
"No. If you're not-stupid, I'd like to introduce you to him.
Speaking of jokes--Do you have a sense of humor?"
"Certainly I have!" is what Wyoming did not answer--and any other
woman would as a locked-in program. She blinked thoughtfully and said,
"You'll have to judge for yourself, cobber. I have something I use for
one. It serves my simple purposes."
"Fine." I dug into pouch, found print-roll of one hundred "funny"
stories. "Read. Tell me which are funny, which are not--and which get a
giggle first time but are cold pancakes without honey to hear twice."
"Manuel, you may be. the oddest man I've ever met." She took that
print-out. "Say, is this computer paper?"
"Yes. Met a computer with a sense of humor."
"So? Well, it was bound to come some day. Everything else has been
mechanized."
I gave proper response and added "Everything?"
She looked up. "Please. Don't whistle while I'm reading."

4
Heard her giggle a few times while I rigged out bed and made it. Then sat
down by her, took end she was through with and started reading. Chuckled
a time or two but a joke isn't too funny to me if read cold, even when I
see it could be fission job at proper time. I got more interested in how
Wyoh rated them.
She was marking "plus,"
"minus," and sometimes question mark, and plus stories were marked
"once" or "always"--few were marked "always." I put my ratings under
hers. Didn't disagree too often.
By time I was near end she was looking over my judgments. We
finished together. "Well?" I said. "What do you think?"
"I think you have a crude, rude mind and it's a wonder your wives
put up with you."
"Mum often says so. But how about yourself, Wyoh? You marked
plusses on some that would make a slot-machine girl blush."

She grinned. "Da. Don't tell anybody; publicly I'm a dedicated
party organizer above such things. Have you decided that I have a sense
of humor?"
"Not sure. Why a minus on number seventeen?"
"Which one is that?" She reversed roll and found it. "Why, any
woman would have done the same! It's not funny, it's simply necessary."
"Yes, but think how silly she looked."
"Nothing silly about it. Just sad. And look here. You thought this
one was not funny. Number fifty-one."
Neither reversed any judgments but I saw a pattern: Disagreements
were over stories concerning oldest funny subject. Told her so. She
nodded. "Of course. I saw that. Never mind, Mannie dear; I long ago quit
being disappointed in men for what they are not and never can be."
I decided to drop it. Instead told her about Mike.
Soon she said, "Mannie, you're telling me that this computer is
alive?"
"What do you mean?' I answered. "He doesn't sweat, or go to W. C.
But can think and talk and he's aware of himself. Is he 'alive'?"
"I'm not sure what I mean by 'alive,'" she admitted. "There's a
scientific definition, isn't there? Irritability, or some such. And
reproduction."
"Mike is irritable and can be irritating. As for reproducing, not
designed for it but--yes, given time and materials and very special help,
Mike could reproduce himself."
"I need very special help, too," Wyoh answered, "since I'm sterile.
And it takes me ten whole lunars and many kilograms of the best
materials. But I make good babies. Mannie, why shouldn't a machine be
alive? I've always felt they were. Some of them wait for a chance to
savage you in a tender spot."
"Mike wouldn't do that. Not on purpose, no meanness in him. But he
likes to play jokes and one might go wrong--like a puppy who doesn't know
he's biting. He's ignorant No, not ignorant, he knows enormously more
than I, or you, or any man who ever lived. Yet he doesn't know anything."
"Better repeat that. I missed something."
I tried to explain. How Mike knew almost every book in Luna, could
read at least a thousand times as fast as we could and never forget
anything unless he chose to erase, how he could reason with perfect
logic, or make shrewd guesses from insufficient data... and yet not know
anything about how to be "alive." She interrupted. "I scan it. You're
saying he's smart and knows a lot but is not sophisticated. Like a new
chum when he grounds on The Rock. Back Earthside he might be a professor
with a string of degrees... but here he's a baby."
"That's it. Mike is a baby with a long string of degrees. Ask how
much water and what chemicals and how much photoflux it takes to crop
fifty thousand tonnes of wheat and he'll tell you without stopping for
breath. But can't tell if a joke is funny,"
"I thought most of these were fairly good."
"They're ones he's heard--read--and were marked jokes so he filed
them that way. But doesn't understand them because he's never been a--a
people. Lately he's been trying to make up jokes. Feeble, very." I tried
to explain Mike's pathetic attempts to be a "people."
"On top of that, he's lonely."

"Why, the poor thing! You'd be lonely, too, if you did nothing but
work, work, work, study, study, study, and never anyone to visit with.
Cruelty, that's what it is."
So I told about promise to find "not-stupids."
"Would you chat with him, Wye? And not laugh when he makes funny
mistakes? If you do, he shuts up and sulks."
"Of course I would, Mannie! Uh... once we get out of this mess. If
it's safe for me to be in Luna City. Where is this poor little computer?
City Engineering Central? I don't know my way around here."
"He's not in L-City; he's halfway across Crisium. And you couldn't
go down where he is; takes a pass from Warden. But--"
"Hold it! 'Halfway across Crisium--' Mannie, this computer is one
of those at Authority Complex?"
"Mike isn't just 'one of those' computers," I answered, vexed on
Mike's account. "He's boss; he waves baton for all others. Others are
just machines, extensions of Mike, like this is for me," I said, flexing
hand of left arm. "Mike controls them. He runs catapult personally, was
his first job--catapult and ballistic radars. But he's logic for phone
system, too, after they converted to Lunawide switching. Besides that,
he's supervising logic for other systems."
Wyoh closed eyes and pressed fingers to temples. "Mannie, does Mike
hurt?"
"'Hurt?' No strain. Has time to read jokes."
"I don't mean that. I mean: Can he hurt? Feel pain?"
"What? No. Can get feelings hurt. But can't feel pain. Don't think
he can. No, sure he can't, doesn't have receptors for pain. Why?"
She covered eyes and said softly, "Bog help me." Then looked up and
said, "Don't you see, Mannie? You have a pass to go down where this
computer is. But most Loonies can't even leave the tube at that station;
it's for Authority employees only. Much less go inside the main computer
room. I had to find out if it could feel pain because--well, because you
got me feeling sorry for it, with your talk about how it was lonely! But,
Mannie, do you realize what a few kilos of toluol plastic would do
there?"
"Certainly do!" Was shocked and disgusted.
"Yes. We'll strike right after the explosion--and Luna will be
free! Mmm... I'll get you explosives and fuses--but we can't move until
we are organized to exploit it. Mannie, I've got to get out of here, I
must risk it. I'll go put on makeup." She started to get up.
I shoved her down, with hard left hand. Surprised her, and
surprised me--had not touched her in any way save necessary contact. Oh,
different today, but was 2075 and touching a fem without her consent-plenty of lonely men to come to rescue and airlock never far away. As
kids say, Judge Lynch never sleeps.
"Sit down, keep quiet!" I said. "I know what a blast would do.
Apparently you don't. Gospazha, am sorry to say this... but if came to
choice, would eliminate you before would blow up Mike."
Wyoming did not get angry. Really was a man some ways--her years as
a disciplined revolutionist I'm sure; she was all girl most ways.
"Mannie, you told me that Shorty Mkrum is dead."
"What?" Was confused by sharp turn. "Yes. Has to be. One leg off at
hip, it was; must have bled to death in two minutes. Even in a surgery
amputation that high is touch-and-go." (I know such things; had taken

luck and big transfusions to save me--and an arm isn't in same class with
what happened to Shorty.)
"Shorty was," she said soberly, "my best friend here and one of my
best friends anywhere. He was all that I admire in a man--loyal, honest,
intelligent, gentle, and brave--and devoted to the Cause. But have you
seen me grieving over him?"
"No. Too late to grieve."
"It's never too late for grief. I've grieved every instant since
you told me. But I locked it in the back of my mind for the Cause leaves
no time for grief. Mannie, if it would have bought freedom for Luna--or
even been part of the price--I would have eliminated Shorty myself. Or
you. Or myself. And yet you have qualms over blowing up a computer!"
"Not that at all!" (But was, in part. When a man dies, doesn't
shock me too much; we get death sentences day we are born. But Mike was
unique and no reason not to be immortal. Never mind "souls"--prove Mike
did not have one. And if no soul, so much worse. No? Think twice,)
"Wyoming, what would happen if we blew up Mike? Tell."
"I don't know precisely. But it would cause a great deal of
confusion and that's exactly what we--"
"Seal it. You don't know. Confusion, da. Phones out. Tubes stop
running. Your town not much hurt; Kong Kong has own power. But L-City and
Novylen and other warrens all power stops. Total darkness. Shortly gets
stuffy. Then temperature drops and pressure. Where's your p-suit?"
"Checked at Tube Station West."
"So is mine. Think you can find way? In solid dark? In time? Not
sure I can and I was born in this warren. With corridors filled with
screaming people? Loonies are a tough mob; we have to be--but about one
in ten goes off his cams in total dark. Did you swap bottles for fresh
charges or were you in too much hurry? And will suit be there with
thousands trying to find p-suits and not caring who owns?"
"But aren't there emergency arrangements? There are in Hong Kong
Luna."
"Some. Not enough. Control of anything essential to life should be
decentralized and paralleled so that if one machine fails, another takes
over. But costs money and as you pointed out, Authority doesn't care.
Mike shouldn't have all jobs. But was cheaper to ship up master machine,
stick deep in The Rock where couldn't get hurt, then keep adding capacity
and loading on jobs--did you know Authority makes near as much gelt from
leasing Mike's services as from trading meat and wheat? Does. Wyoming,
not sure we would lose Luna City if Mike were blown up. Loonies are handy
and might jury-rig till automation could be restored. But I tell you
true: Many people would die and rest too busy for politics."
I marveled it. This woman had been in The Rock almost all her
life... yet could think of something as new-choomish as wrecking
engineering controls. "Wyoming, if you were smart like you are beautiful,
you wouldn't talk about blowing up Mike; you would think about how to get
him on your side."
"What do you mean?" she said. "The Warden controls the computers."
"Don't know what I mean," I admitted. "But don't think Warden
controls computers--wouldn't know a computer from a pile of rocks.
Warden, or staff, decides policies, general plans. Half-competent
technicians program these into Mike. Mike sorts them, makes sense of
them, plans detailed programs, parcels them out where they belong, keeps
things moving. But nobody controls Mike; he's too smart. He carries out

what is asked because that's how he's built. But he's selfprogramming
logic, makes own decisions. And a good thing, because if he weren't
smart, system would not work."
"I still don't see what you mean by 'getting him on our side.'"
"Oh. Mike doesn't feel loyalty to Warden. As you pointed out: He's
a machine. But if I wanted to foul up phones without touching air or
water or lights, I would talk to Mike. If it struck him funny, he might
do it."
"Couldn't you just program it? I understood that you can get into
the room where he is."
"If I--or anybody--programmed such an order into Mike without
talking it over with him, program would be placed in 'hold' location and
alarms would sound in many places. But if Mike wanted to--" I told her
about cheque for umpteen jillion. "Mike is still finding himself, Wyoh.
And lonely. Told me I was 'his only friend'--and was so open and
vulnerable I wanted to bawl. If you took pains to be his friend, too-without thinking of him as 'just a machine'--well, not sure what it would
do, haven't analyzed it. But if I tried anything big and dangerous, would
want Mike in my corner."
She said thoughtfully, "I wish there were some way for me to sneak
into that room where he is. I don't suppose makeup would help?"
"Oh, don't have to go there. Mike is on phone. Shall we call him?"
She stood up. "Mannie, you are not only the oddest man I've met;
you are the most exasperating. What's his number?"
"Comes from associating too much with a computer." I went to phone.
"Just one thing, Wyoh. You get what you want out of a man just by batting
eyes and undulating framework."
"Well... sometimes. But I do have a brain."
"Use it. Mike is not a man. No gonads. No hormones. No instincts.
Use fem tactics and it's a null signal. Think of him as supergenius child
too young to notice vive-la-difference."
"I'll remember. Mannie, why do you call him 'he'?"
"Uh, can't call him 'it,' don't think of him as 'she.'"
"Perhaps I had better think of him as 'she.' Of her as 'she' I
mean."
"Suit yourself." I punched MYCROFFXXX, standing so body shielded
it; was not ready to share number till I saw how thing went. Idea of
blowing up Mike had shaken me. "Mike?"
"Hello, Man my only friend."
"May not be only friend from now on, Mike. Want you to meet
somebody. Not-stupid."
"I knew you were not alone, Man; I can hear breathing. Will you
please ask Not-Stupid to move closer to the phone?"
Wyoming looked panicky. She whispered, "Can he see?"
"No, Not-Stupid, I cannot see you; this phone has no video circuit.
But binaural microphonic receptors place you with some accuracy. From
your voice, your breathing, your heartbeat, and the fact that you are
alone in a bundling room with a mature male I extrapolate that you are
female human, sixtyfive-plus kilos in mass, and of mature years, on the
close order of thirty."
Wyoming gasped. I cut in. "Mike, her name is Wyoming Knott."
"I'm very pleased to meet you, Mike. You can call me 'Wye.'"
"Why not?" Mike answered.
I cut in again. "Mike, was that a joke?"

"Yes, Man. I noted that her first name as shortened differs from
the English causation-inquiry word by only an aspiration and that her
last name has the same sound as the general negator. A pun. Not funny?"
Wyoh said, "Quite funny, Mike. I--"
I waved to her to shut up. "A good pun, Mike. Example of 'funnyonly-once' class of joke. Funny through element of surprise. Second time,
no surprise; therefore not funny. Check?"
"I had tentatively reached that conclusion about puns in thinking
over your remarks two conversations back. I am pleased to find my
reasoning confirmed."
"Good boy, Mike; making progress. Those hundred jokes--I've read
them and so has Wyoh."
"Wyoh? Wyoming Knott?"
"Huh? Oh, sure. Wyoh, Wye, Wyoming, Wyoming Knott--all same. Just
don't call her 'Why not'."
"I agreed not to use that pun again, Man. Gospazha, shall I call
you 'Wyoh' rather than 'Wye'? I conjecture that the monosyllabic form
could be confused with the causation inquiry monosyllable through
insufficient redundancy and without intention of punning."
Wyoming blinked--Mike's English at that time could be smothering-but came back strong. "Certainly, Mike. 'Wyoh' is the form of my name
that I like best."
"Then I shall use it. The full form of your first name is still
more subject to misinterpretation as it is identical in sound with the
name of an administrative region in Northwest Managerial Area of the
North American Directorate."
"I know, I was born there and my parents named me after the State.
I don't remember much about it."
"Wyoh, I regret that this circuit does not permit display of
pictures. Wyoming is a rectangular area lying between Terran coordinates
forty-one and forty-five degrees north, one hundred four degrees three
minutes west and one hundred eleven degrees three minutes west, thus
containing two hundred fifty three thousand, five hundred ninety-seven
point two six square kilometers. It is a region of high plains and of
mountains, having limited fertility but esteemed for natural beauty. Its
population was sparse until augmented through the relocation subplan of
the Great New York Urban Renewal Program, A. D. twenty-twenty-five
through twenty-thirty."
"That was before I was born," said Wyoh, "but I know about it; my
grandparents were relocated--and you could say that's how I wound up in
Luna."
"Shall I continue about the area named 'Wyoming'?" Mike asked.
"No, Mike," I cut in, "you probably have hours of it in storage."
"Nine point seven three hours at speech speed not including crossreferences, Man."
"Was afraid so. Perhaps Wyoh will want it some day. But purpose of
call is to get you acquainted with this Wyoming... who happens also to be
a high region of natural beauty and imposing mountains."
"And limited fertility," added Wyoh. "Mannie, if you are going to
draw silly parallels, you should include that one. Mike isn't interested
in how I look."
"How do you know? Mike, wish I could show you picture of her."
"Wyoh, I am indeed interested in your appearance; I am hoping that
you will be my friend. But I have seen several pictures of you."

"You have? When and how?"
"I searched and then studied them as soon as I heard your name. I
am contract custodian of the archive files of the Birth Assistance Clinic
in Hong Kong Luna. In addition to biological and physiological data and
case histories the bank contains ninety-six pictures of you. So I studied
them."
Wyoh looked very startled. "Mike can do that," I explained, "in
time it takes us to hiccup. You'll get used to it."
"But heavens! Mannie, do you realize what sort of pictures the
Clinic takes?"
"Hadn't thought about it."
"Then don't! Goodness!"
Mike spoke in voice painfully shy, embarrassed as a puppy who has
made mistakes. "Gospazha Wyoh, if I have offended, it was unintentional
and I am most sorry. I can erase those pictures from my temporary storage
and key the Clinic archive so that I can look at them only on retrieval
demand from the Clinic and then without association or mentation. Shall I
do so?"
"He can," I assured her. "With Mike you can always make a fresh
start--better than humans that way. He can forget so completely that he
can't be tempted to look later... and couldn't think about them even if
called on to retrieve. So take his offer if you're in a huhu."
"Uh... no, Mike, it's all right for you to see them. But don't show
them to Mannie!"
Mike hesitated a long time--four seconds or more. Was, I think,
type of dilemma that pushes lesser computers into nervous breakdowns. But
he resolved it. "Man my only friend, shall I accept this instruction?"
"Program it, Mike," I answered, "and lock it in. But, Wyoh, isn't
that a narrow attitude? One might do you justice. Mike could print it out
for me next time I'm there."
"The first example in each series," Mike offered, "would be, on the
basis of my associational analysis of such data, of such pulchritudinous
value as to please any healthy, mature human male."
"How about it, Wyoh? To pay for apleistrudel."
"Uh... a picture of me with my hair pinned up in a towel and
standing in front of a grid without a trace of makeup? Are you out of
your rock-happy mind? Mike, don't let him have it!"
"I shall not let him have it. Man, this is a not-stupid?"
"For a girl, yes. Girls are interesting, Mike; they can reach
conclusions with even less data than you can. Shall we drop subject and
consider jokes?"
That diverted them. We ran down list, giving our conclusions. Then
tried to explain jokes Mike had failed to understand. With mixed success.
But real stumbler turned out to be stories I had marked "funny" and Wyoh
had judged "not" or vice versa; Wyoh asked Mike his opinion of each.
Wish she had asked him before we gave our opinions; that electronic
juvenile delinquent always agreed with her, disagreed with me. Were those
Mike's honest opinions? Or was he trying to lubricate new acquaintance
into friendship? Or was it his skewed notion of humor--joke on me? Didn't
ask.
But as pattern completed Wyob wrote a note on phone's memo pad:
"Mannie, re --17, 51, 53, 87, 90, & 99--Mike is a she!"
I let it go with a shrug, stood up. "Mike, twenty-two hours since
I've had sleep. You kids chat as long as you want to. Call you tomorrow."
"Goodnight, Man. Sleep well. Wyoh, are you sleepy?"

"No, Mike, I had a nap. But, Mannie, we'll keep you awake. No?"
"No. When I'm sleepy, I sleep." Started making couch into bed.
Wyoh said, "Excuse me, Mike," got up, took sheet out of my hands.
"I'll make it up later. You doss over there, tovarishch; you're bigger
than I am. Sprawl out."
Was too tired to argue, sprawled out, asleep at once. Seem to
remember hearing in sleep giggles and a shriek but never woke enough to
be certain.
Woke up later and came fully awake when I realized was hearing two
fem voices, one Wyoh's warm contralto, other a sweet, high soprano with
French accent. Wyoh chuckled at something and answered, "All right,
Michelle dear, I'll call you soon. 'Night, darling."
"Fine. Goodnight, dear."
Wyoh stood up, turned around. "Who's your girl friend?" I asked.
Thought she knew no one in Luna City. Might have phoned Hong Kong... had
sleep-logged feeling was some reason she shouldn't phone.
"That? Why, Mike, of course. We didn't mean to wake you."
"What?"
"Oh. It was actually Michelle. I discussed it with Mike, what sex
he was, I mean. He decided that he could be either one. So now she's
Michelle and that was her voice. Got it right the first time, too; her
voice never cracked once."
"Of course not; just shifted voder a couple of octaves. What are
you trying to do: split his personality?"
"It's not just pitch; when she's Michelle its an entire change in
manner and attitude. Don't worry about splitting her personality; she has
plenty for any personality she needs. Besides, Mannie, it's much easier
for both of us. Once she shifted, we took our hair down and cuddled up
and talked girl talk as if we had known each other forever. For example,
those silly pictures no longer embarrassed me--in fact we discussed my
pregnancies quite a lot. Michelle was terribly interested. She knows all
about O. B. and G. Y. and so forth but just theory--and she appreciated
the raw facts. Actually, Mannie, Michelle is much more a woman than Mike
was a man."
"Well... suppose it's okay. Going to be a shock to me first time I
call Mike and a woman answers."
"Oh, but she won't!"
"Huh?"
"Michelle is my friend. When you call, you'll get Mike. She gave me
a number to keep it straight--'Michelle' spelled with a Y. M Y, C, H, E,
L, L, E, and Y, Y, Y make it come out ten."
I felt vaguely jealous while realizing it was silly. Suddenly Wyoh
giggled. "And she told me a string of new jokes, ones you wouldn't think
were funny--and, boy, does she know rough ones!"
"Mike--or his sister Michelle--is a low creature. Let's make up
couch. I'll switch."
"Stay where you are. Shut up. Turn over. Go back to sleep." I shut
up, turned over, went back to sleep.
Sometime much later I became aware of "married" feeling--something
warm snuggled up to my back. Would not have wakened but she was sobbing
softly. I turned and got her head on my arm, did not speak. She stopped
sobbing; presently breathing became slow and even. I went back to sleep.

5
We must have slept like dead for next thing I knew phone was sounding and
its light was blinking. I called for room lights, started to get up,
found a load on right upper arm, dumped it gently, climbed over,
answered.
Mike said, "Good morning, Man. Professor de la Paz is talking to
your home number."
"Can you switch it here? As a 'Sherlock'?"
"Certainly, Man."
"Don't interrupt call. Cut him in as he switches off. Where is he?"
"A public phone in a taproom called The Iceman's Wife underneath
the--"
"I know. Mike, when you switch me in, can you stay in circuit? Want
you to monitor."
"It shall be done."
"Can you tell if anyone is in earshot? Hear breathing?"
"I infer from the anechoic quality of his voice that he is speaking
under a hush hood. But I infer also that, in a taproom, others would be
present. Do you wish to hear, Man?"
"Uh, do that. Switch me in. And if he raises hood, tell me. You're
a smart cobber, Mike."
"Thank you, Man." Mike cut me in; I found that Mum was talking: "-ly I'll tell him, Professor. I'm so sorry that Manuel is not home. There
is no number you can gave me? He is anxious to return your call; he made
quite a point that I was to be sure to get a number from you."
"I'm terribly sorry, dear lady, but I'm leaving at once. But, let
me see, it is now eight-fifteen; I'll try to call back just at nine, if I
may."
"Certainly, Professor." Mum's voice had a coo in it that she
reserves for males not her husbands of whom she approves--sometimes for
us. A moment later Mike said, "Now!" and I spoke up: "Hi, Prof! Hear
you've been looking for me. This is Mannie."
I heard a gasp. "I would have sworn I switched this phone off. Why,
I have switched it off; it must be broken. Manuel--so good to hear your
voice, dear boy. Did you just get home?"
"I'm not home."
"But--but you must be. I haven't--"
"No time for that, Prof. Can anyone overhear you?"
"I don't think so. I'm using a hush booth."
"Wish I could see. Prof, what's my birthday?"
He hesitated. Then he said, "I see. I think I see. July
fourteenth."
"I'm convinced. Okay, let's talk."
"You're really not calling from your home, Manuel? Where are you?"
"Let that pass a moment. You asked my wife about a girl. No names
needed. Why do you want to find her, Prof?"
"I want to warn her. She must not try to go back to her home city.
She would be arrested."
"Why do you think so?"

"Dear boy! Everyone at that meeting is in grave danger. Yourself,
too. I was so happy--even though confused--to hear you say that you are
not at home. You should not go home at present. If you have some safe
place to stay, it would be well to take a vacation. You are aware--you
must be even though you left hastily--that there was violence last
night."
I was aware! Killing Warden's bodyguards must be against Authority
Regulations--at least if I were Warden, I'd take a dim view. "Thanks,
Prof; I'll be careful. And if I see this girl, I'll tell her."
"You don't know where to find her? You were seen to leave with her
and I had so hoped that you would know."
"Prof, why this interest? Last night you didn't seem to be on her
side."
"No, no, Manuel! She is my comrade. I don't say 'tovarishch' for I
mean it not just as politeness but in the older sense. Binding. She is my
comrade. We differ only in tactics. Not in objectives, not in loyalties."
"I see. Well, consider message delivered. She'll get it."
"Oh, wonderful! I ask no questions... but I do hope, oh so very
strongly, that you can find a way for her to be safe, really safe, until
this blows over."
I thought that over. "Wait a moment, Prof. Don't switch off." As I
answered phone, Wyoh had headed for bath, probably to avoid listening;
she was that sort.
Tapped on door. "Wyoh?"
"Out in a second."
"Need advice."
She opened door. "Yes, Mannie?"
"How does Professor de la Paz rate in your organization? Is he
trusted? Do you trust him?"
She looked thoughtful. "Everyone at the meeting was supposed to be
vouched for. But I don't know him."
"Mmm. You have feeling about him?"
"I liked him, even though he argued against me. Do you know
anything about him?"
"Oh, yes, known him twenty years. I trust him. But can't extend
trust for you. Trouble--and it's your air bottle, not mine."
She smiled warmly. "Mannie, since you trust him, I trust him just
as firmly."
I went back to phone. "Prof, are you on dodge?"
He chuckled. "Precisely, Manuel."
"Know a hole called Grand Hotel Raffles? Room L two decks below
lobby. Can you get here without tracks, have you had breakfast, what do
you like for breakfast?"
He chuckled again. "Manuel, one pupil can make a teacher feel that
his years were not wasted. I know where it is, I shall get there quietly,
I have not broken fast, and I eat anything I can't pat."
Wyoh had started putting beds together; I went to help. "What do
you want for breakfast?"
"Chai and toast. Juice would be nice."
"Not enough."
"Well... a boiled egg. But I pay for breakfast."
"Two boiled eggs, buttered toast with jam, juice. I'll roll you."
"Your dice, or mine?"

"Mine. I cheat. " I went to lift, asked for display, saw something
called THE HAPPY HANGOVER--ALL PORTIONS EXTRA LARGE--tomato juice,
scrambled eggs, ham steak, fried potatoes, corn cakes and honey, toast,
butter, milk, tea or coffee--HKL $4 .50 for two--I ordered it for two, no
wish to advertise third person.
We were clean and shining, room orderly and set for breakfast, and
Wyoh had changed from black outfit into red dress "because company was
coming" when lift jingled food. Change into dress had caused words. She
had posed, smiled, and said, "Mannie, I'm so pleased with this dress. How
did you know it would suit me so well?"
"Genius."
"I think you may be. What did it cost? I must pay you."
"On sale, marked down to Authority cents fifty."
She clouded up and stomped foot. Was bare, made no sound, caused
her to bounce a half meter. "Happy landing!" I wished her, while she
pawed for foothold like a new chum.
"Manuel O'Kelly! If you think I will accept expensive clothing from
a man I'm not even bundling with!"
"Easily corrected."
"Lecher! I'll tell your wives!"
"Do that. Mum always thinks worst of me." I went to lift, started
dealing out dishes; door sounded. I flipped hearum-no-seeum. "Who comes?"
"Message for Gospodin Smith," a cracked voice answered. "Gospodin
Bernard O. Smith."
I flipped bolts and let Professor Bernardo de la Paz in. He looked
like poor grade of salvage--dirty clothes, filthy himself, hair unkempt,
paralyzed down one side and hand twisted, one eye a film of cataract-perfect picture of old wrecks who sleep in Bottom Alley and cadge drinks
and pickled eggs in cheap taprooms. He drooled.
As soon as I bolted door he straightened up, let features come back
to normal, folded hands over wishbone, looked Wyoh up and down, sucked
air kimono style, and whistled. "Even more lovely," he said, "than I
remembered!"
She smiled, over her mad. "'Thanks, Professor. But don't bother.
Nobody here but comrades."
"Señorita, the day I let politics interfere with my appreciation of
beauty, that day I retire from politics. But you are gracious." He looked
away, glanced closely around room.
I said, "Prof, quit checking for evidence, you dirty old man. Last
night was politics, nothing but politics."
"That's not true!" Wyoh flared up. "I struggled for hours! But he
was too strong for me. Professor--what's the party discipline in such
cases? Here in Luna City?"
Prof tut-tutted and rolled blank eye. "Manuel, I'm surprised. It's
a serious matter, my dear--elimination, usually. But it must be
investigated. Did you come here willingly?"
"He drugged me."
"'Dragged,' dear lady. Let's not corrupt the language. Do you have
bruises to show?"
I said, "Eggs getting cold. Can't we eliminate me after breakfast?"
"An excellent thought," agreed Prof. "Manuel, could you spare your
old teacher a liter of water to make himself more presentable?"
"All you want, in there. Don't drag or you'll get what littlest pig
got."

"Thank you, sir."
He retired; were sounds of brushing and washing. Wyoh and I
finished arranging table. "'Bruises,'" I said. "Struggled all night.'"
"You deserved it, you insulted me."
"How?"
"You failed to insult me, that's how. After you drugged me here."
"Mmm. Have to get Mike to analyze that."
"Michelle would understand it. Mannie, may I change my mind and
have a little piece of that ham?"
"Half is yours, Prof is semi-vegetarian." Prof came out and, while
did not look his most debonair, was neat and clean, hair combed, dimples
back and happy sparkle in eye--fake cataract gone. "Prof, how do you do
it?"
"Long practice, Manuel; I've been in this business far longer than
you young people. Just once, many years ago in Lima--a lovely city--I
ventured to stroll on a fine day without such forethought... and it got
me transported. What a beautiful table!"
"Sit by me, Prof," Wyoh invited. "I don't want to sit by him.
Rapist."
"Look," I said, "first we eat, then we eliminate me. Prof, fill
plate and tell what happened last night."
"May I suggest a change in program? Manuel, the life of a
conspirator is not an easy one and I learned before you were born not to
mix provender and politics. Disturbs the gastric enzymes and leads to
ulcers, the occupational disease of the underground. Mmm! That fish
smells good."
"Fish?"
"That pink salmon," Prof answered, pointing at ham.
A long, pleasant time later we reached coffee/tea stage. Prof
leaned back, sighed and said, "Bolshoyeh spasebaw, Gospazha ee Gospodin.
Tak for mat, it was wonderfully good. I don't know when I've felt more at
peace with the world. Ah yes! Last evening--I saw not too much of the
proceedings because, just as you two were achieving an admirable retreat,
I lived to fight another day--I bugged out. Made it to the wings in one
long flat dive. When I did venture to peek out, the party was over, most
had left, and all yellow jackets were dead."
(Note: Must correct this; I learned more later. When trouble
started, as I was trying to get Wyoh through door, Prof produced a hand
gun and, firing over heads, picked off three bodyguards at rear main
door, including one wearing bull voice. How he smuggled weapon up to The
Rock--or managed to liberate it later--I don't know. But Prof's shooting
joined with Shorty's work to turn tables; not one yellow jacket got out
alive. Several people were burned and four were killed--but knives,
hands, and heels finished it in seconds.)
"Perhaps I should say, 'All but one,'" Prof went on. "Two cossacks
at the door through which you departed had been given quietus by our
brave comrade Shorty Mkrum... and I am sorry to say that Shorty was lying
across them, dying--"
"We knew."
"So. Duke et decorum. One guard in that doorway had a damaged face
but was still moving; I gave his neck a treatment known in professional
circles Earthside as the Istanbul twist. He joined his mates. By then
most of the living had left. Just myself, our chairman of the evening
Finn Nielsen, a comrade known as 'Mom,' that being what her husbands

called her. I consulted with Comrade Finn and we bolted all doors. That
left a cleaning job. Do you know the arrangements backstage there?"
"Not me," I said. Wyoh shook head.
"There is a kitchen and pantry, used for banquets. I suspect that
Mom and family run a butcher shop for they disposed of bodies as fast as
Finn and I carried them back, their speed limited only by the rate at
which portions could be ground up and flushed into the city's cloaca. The
sight made me quite faint, so I spent time mopping in the hall. Clothing
was the difficult part, especially those quasi-military uniforms."
"What did you do with those laser guns?"
Prof turned bland eyes on me. "Guns? Dear me, they must have
disappeared. We removed everything of a personal nature from bodies of
our departed comrades--for relatives, for identification, for sentiment.
Eventually we had everything tidy--not a job that would fool Interpol but
one as to make it seem unlikely that anything untoward had taken place.
We conferred, agreed that it would be well not to be seen soon, and left
severally, myself by a pressure door above the stage leading up to level
six. Thereafter I tried to call you, Manuel, being worried about your
safety and that of this dear lady." Prof bowed to Wyoh. "That completes
the tale. I spent the night in quiet places."
"Prof," I said, "those guards were new chums, still getting their
legs. Or we wouldn't have won."
"That could be," he agreed. "But had they not been, the outcome
would have been the same."
"How so? They were armed."
"Lad, have you ever seen a boxer dog? I think not--no dogs that
large in Luna. The boxer is a result of special selection. Gentle and
intelligent, he turns instantly into deadly killer when occasion
requires.
"Here has been bred an even more curious creature. I know of no
city on Terra with as high standards of good manners and consideration
for one's fellow man as here in Luna. By comparison, Terran cities--I
have known most major ones--are barbaric. Yet the Loonie is as deadly as
the boxer dog. Manuel, nine guards, no matter how armed, stood no chance
against that pack. Our patron used bad judgment."
"Um. Seen a morning paper, Prof? Or a video cast?"
"The latter, yes."
"Nothing in late news last night."
"Nor this morning."
"Odd," I said.
"What's odd about it?" asked Wyoh. "We won't talk--and we have
comrades in key places in every paper in Luna."
Prof shook his head. "No, my dear. Not that simple. Censorship. Do
you know how copy is set in our newspapers?"
"Not exactly. It's done by machinery."
"Here's what Prof means," I told her. "News is typed in editorial
offices. From there on it's a leased service directed by a master
computer at Authority Complex"--hoped she would notice "master computer"
rather than "Mike"--"copy prints out there via phone circuit. These rolls
feed into a computer section which reads, sets copy, and prints out
newspapers at several locations. Novylen edition of Daily Lunatic prints
out in Novylen changes in ads and local stories, and computer makes
changes from standard symbols, doesn't have to be told how. What Prof
means is that at print-out at Authority Complex, Warden could intervene.

Same for all news services, both off and to Luna--they funnel through
computer room."
"The point is," Prof went on, "the Warden could have killed the
story. It's irrelevant whether he did. Or--check me, Manuel; you know I'm
hazy about machinery--he could insert a story, too, no matter how many
comrades we have in newspaper offices."
"Sure," I agreed. "At Complex, anything can be added, cut, or
changed."
"And that, señorita, is the weakness of our Cause. Communications.
Those goons were not important--but crucially important is that it lay
with the Warden, not with us, to decide whether the story should be told.
To a revolutionist, communications are a sine-qua-non."
Wyoh looked at me and I could see synapses snapping. So I changed
subject. "Prof. why get rid of bodies? Besides horrible job, was
dangerous. Don't know how many bodyguards Warden has, but more could show
up while you were doing it."
"Believe me, lad, we feared that. But although I was almost
useless, it was my idea, I had to convince the others. Oh, not my
original idea but remembrance of things past, an historical principle."
"What principle?"
"Terror! A man can face known danger. But the unknown frightens
him. We disposed of those finks, teeth and toenails, to strike terror
into their mates. Nor do I know how many effectives the Warden has, but I
guarantee they are less effective today. Their mates went out on an easy
mission. Nothing came back."
Wyoh shivered. "It scares me, too. They won't be anxious to go
inside a warren again. But, Professor, you say you don't know how many
bodyguards the Warden keeps. The Organization knows. Twenty-seven. If
nine were killed, only eighteen are left. Perhaps it's time for a putsch.
No?"
"No," I answered.
"Why not, Mannie? They'll never be weaker."
"Not weak enough. Killed nine because they were crackers to walk in
where we were. But if Warden stays home with guards around him--Well, had
enough shoulder-to-shoulder noise last night." I turned to Prof. "But
still I'm interested in fact--if it is--that Warden now has only
eighteen. You said Wyoh should not go to Hong Kong and I should not go
home. But if he has only eighteen left, I wonder how much danger? Later
after he gets reinforcements.--but now, well, L-City has four main exits
plus many little ones. How many can they guard? What's to keep Wyoh from
walking to Tube West, getting p-suit, going home?"
"She might," Prof agreed.
"I think I must," Wyoh said. "I can't stay here forever. If I have
to hide, I can do better in Hong Kong, where I know people."
"You might get away with it, my dear. I doubt it. There were two
yellow jackets at Tube Station West last night; I saw them. They may not
be there now. Let's assume they are not. You go to the station--disguised
perhaps. You get your p-suit and take a capsule to Beluthihatchie. As you
climb out to take the bus to Endsville, you're arrested. Communications.
No need to post a yellow jacket at the station; it is enough that someone
sees you there. A phone call does the rest."
"But you assumed that I was disguised."
"Your height cannot be disguised and your pressure suit would be
watched. By someone not suspected of any connection with the Warden. Most

probably a comrade." Prof dimpled. "The trouble with conspiracies is that
they rot internally. When the number is as high as four, chances are even
that one is a spy."
Wyoh said glumly, "You make it sound hopeless."
"Not at all, my dear. One chance in a thousand, perhaps."
"I can't believe it. I don't believe it! Why, in the years I've
been active we have gained members by the hundreds! We have organizations
in all major cities. We have the people with us."
Prof shook head. "Every new member made it that much more likely
that you would be betrayed. Wyoming dear lady, revolutions are not won by
enlisting the masses. Revolution is a science only a few are competent to
practice. It depends on correct organization and, above all, on
communications. Then, at the proper moment in history, they strike.
Correctly organized and properly timed it is a bloodless coup. Done
clumsily or prematurely and the result is civil war, mob violence,
purges, terror. I hope you will forgive me if I say that, up to now, it
has been done clumsily."
Wyoh looked baffled. "What do you mean by 'correct organization'?"
"Functional organization. How does one design an electric motor?
Would you attach a bathtub to it, simply because one was available? Would
a bouquet of flowers help? A heap of rocks? No, you would use just those
elements necessary to its purpose and make it no larger than needed--and
you would incorporate safety factors. Function controls design.
"So it is with revolution. Organization must be no larger than
necessary--never recruit anyone merely because he wants to join. Nor seek
to persuade for the pleasure of having another share your views. He'll
share them when the times comes... or you've misjudged the moment in
history. Oh, there will be an educational organization but it must be
separate; agitprop is no part of basic structure.
"As to basic structure, a revolution starts as a conspiracy
therefore structure is small, secret, and organized as to minimize damage
by betrayal--since there always are betrayals. One solution is the cell
system and so far nothing better has been invented.
"Much theorizing has gone into optimum cell size. I think that
history shows that a cell of three is best--more than three can't agree
on when to have dinner, much less when to strike. Manuel, you belong to a
large family; do you vote on when to have dinner?"
"Bog, no! Mum decides."
"Ah." Prof took a pad from his pouch, began to sketch. "Here is a
cells-of-three tree. If I were planning to take over Luna. I would start
with us three. One would be opted as chairman. We wouldn't vote; choice
would be obvious--or we aren't the right three. We would know the next
nine people, three cells... but each cell would know only one of us."
"Looks like computer diagram--a ternary logic."
"Does it really? At the next level there are two ways of linking:
This comrade, second level, knows his cell leader, his two cellmates, and
on the third level he knows the three in his subcell--he may or may not
know his cellmates' subcells. One method doubles security, the other
doubles speed--of repair if security is penetrated. Let's say he does not
know his cellmates' subcells--Manuel, how many can he betray? Don't say
he won't; today they can brainwash any person, and starch and iron and
use him. How many?"
"Six," I answered. "His boss, two cellmates, three in sub-cell."

"Seven," Prof corrected, "he betrays himself, too. Which leaves
seven broken links on three levels to repair. How?"
"I don't see how it can be," objected Wyoh. "You've got them so
split up it falls to pieces."
"Manuel? An exercise for the student."
"Well... blokes down here have to have way to send message up three
levels. Don't have to know who, just have to know where."
"Precisely!"
"But, Prof," I went on, "there's a better way to rig it."
"Really? Many revolutionary theorists have hammered this out,
Manuel. I have such confidence in them that I'll offer you a wager--at,
say, ten to one."
"Ought to take your money. Take same cells, arrange in open pyramid
of tetrahedrons. Where vertices are in common, each bloke knows one in
adjoining cell--knows how to send message to him, that's all he needs.
Communications never break down because they run sideways as well as up
and down. Something like a neural net. It's why you can knock a hole in a
man's head, take chunk of brain out, and not damage thinking much. Excess
capacity, messages shunt around. He loses what was destroyed but goes on
functioning."
"Manuel," Prof said doubtfully, "could you draw a picture? It
sounds good--but it's so contrary to orthodox doctrine that I need to see
it."
"Well... could do better with stereo drafting machine. I'll try."
(Anybody who thinks it's easy to sketch one hundred twenty-one
tetrahedrons, a five-level open pyramid, clear enough to show
relationships is invited to try!)
Presently I said, "Look at base sketch. Each vertex of each
triangle shares self with zero, one, or two other triangles. Where shares
one, that's its link, one direction or both--but one is enough for a
multipli-redundant communication net. On corners, where sharing is zero,
it jumps to right to next corner. Where sharing is double, choice is
again right-handed.
"Now work it with people. Take fourth level, D-for-dog. This vertex
is comrade Dan. No, let's go down one to show three levels of
communication knocked out--level E-for-easy and pick Comrade Egbert.
"Egbert works under Donald, has cellmates Edward and Elmer, and has
three under him, Frank, Fred, and Fatso... but knows how to send message
to Ezra on his own level but not in his cell. He doesn't know Ezra's
name, face, address, or anything--but has a way, phone number probably,
to reach Ezra in emergency.
"Now watch it work. Casimir, level three, finks out and betrays
Charlie and Cox in his cell, Baker above him, and Donald, Dan, and Dick
in subcell--which isolates Egbert, Edward, and Elmer. and everybody under
them.
"All three report it--redundancy, necessary to any communication
system--but follow Egbert's yell for help. He calls Ezra. But Ezra is
under Charlie and is isolated, too. No matter, Ezra relays both messages
through his safety link, Edmund. By bad luck Edmund is under Cox, so he
also passes it laterally, through Enwright... and that gets it past
burned-out part and it goes up through Dover, Chambers, and Beeswax, to
Adam, front office... who replies down other side of pyramid, with
lateral pass on E-for-easy level from Esther to Egbert and on to Ezra and
Edmund. These two messages, up and down, not only get through at once but

in way they get through, they define to home office exactly how much
damage has been done and where. Organization not only keeps functioning
but starts repairing self at once."
Wyoh was tracing out lines, convincing herself it would work--which
it would, was "idiot" circuit. Let Mike study a few milliseconds, and
could produce a better, safer, more foolproof hookup. And probably-certainly--ways to avoid betrayal while speeding up routings. But I'm not
a computer.
Prof was staring with blank expression. "What's trouble?" I said.
"It'll work; this is my pidgin."
"Manuel my b--Excuse me: Señor O'Kelly... will you head this
revolution?"
"Me? Great Bog, nyet! I'm no lost-cause martyr. Just talking about
circuits."
Wyoh looked up. "Mannie," she said soberly, "you're opted. It's
settled."

6
Did like hell settle it.
Prof said, "Manuel, don't be hasty. Here we are, three, the perfect
number, with a variety of talents and experience. Beauty, age, and mature
male drive--"
"I don't have any drive!"
"Please, Manuel. Let us think in the widest terms before attempting
decisions. And to facilitate such, may I ask if this hostel stocks
potables? I have a few florins I could put into the stream of trade."
Was most sensible word heard in an hour. "Stilichnaya vodka?"
"Sound choice." He reached for pouch.
"Tell it to bear," I said and ordered a liter, plus ice. It came
down; was tomato juice from breakfast.
"Now," I said, after we toasted, "Prof, what you think of pennant
race? Got money says Yankees can't do it again?"
"Manuel, what is your political philosophy?"
"With that new boy from Milwaukee I feel like investing."
"Sometimes a man doesn't have it defined but, under Socratic
inquiry, knows where he stands and why."
"I'll back 'em against field, three to two."
"What? You young idiot! How much?"
"Three hundred. Hong Kong."
"Done. For example, under what circumstances may the State justly
place its welfare above that of a citizen?"
"Mannie," Wyoh asked, "do you have any more foolish money? I think
well of the Phillies."
I looked her over. "Just what were you thinking of betting?"
"You go to hell! Rapist."
"Prof, as I see, are no circumstances under which State is
justified in placing its welfare ahead of mine."
"Good. We have a starting point."

"Mannie," said Wyoh, "that's a most self-centered evaluation."
"I'm a most self-centered person."
"Oh, nonsense. Who rescued me? Me, a stranger. And didn't try to
exploit it. Professor, I was cracking not facking. Mannie was a perfect
knight."
"Sans peur et sans reproche. I knew, I've known him for years.
Which is not inconsistent with evaluation he expressed."
"Oh, but it is! Not the way things are but under the ideal toward
which we aim. Mannie, the 'State' is Luna. Even though not sovereign yet
and we hold citizenships elsewhere. But I am part of the Lunar State and
so is your family. Would you die for your family?"
"Two questions not related."
"Oh, but they are! That's the point."
"Nyet. I know my family, opted long ago."
"Dear Lady, I must come to Manuel's defense. He has a correct
evaluation even though he may not be able to state it. May I ask this?
Under what circumstances is it moral for a group to do that which is not
moral for a member of that group to do alone?"
"Uh... that's a trick question."
"It is the key question, dear Wyoming. A radical question that
strikes to the root of the whole dilemma of government. Anyone who
answers honestly and abides by all consequences knows where he stands-and what he will die for."
Wyoh frowned. "'Not moral for a member of the group--'" she said.
"Professor... what are your political principles?"
"May I first ask yours? If you can state them?"
"Certainly I can! I'm a Fifth Internationalist, most of the
Organization is. Oh, we don't rule out anyone going our way; it's a
united front. We have Communists and Fourths and Ruddyites and Societians
and Single-Taxers and you name it. But I'm no Marxist; we Fifths have a
practical program. Private where private belongs, public where it's
needed, and an admission that circumstances alter cases. Nothing
doctrinaire."
"Capital punishment?"
"For what?"
"Let's say for treason. Against Luna after you've freed Luna."
"Treason how? Unless I knew the circumstances I could not decide."
"Nor could I, dear Wyoming. But I believe in capital punishment
under some circumstances... with this difference. I would not ask a
court; I would try, condemn, execute sentence myself, and accept full
responsibility."
"But--Professor, what are your political beliefs?"
"I'm a rational anarchist."
"I don't know that brand. Anarchist individualist, anarchist
Communist, Christian anarchist, philosophical anarchist, syndicalist,
libertarian--those I know. But what's this? Randite?"
"I can get along with a Randite. A rational anarchist believes that
concepts such as 'state' and 'society' and 'government' have no existence
save as physically exemplified in the acts of self-responsible
individuals. He believes that it is impossible to shift blame, share
blame, distribute blame... as blame, guilt, responsibility are matters
taking place inside human beings singly and nowhere else. But being
rational, he knows that not all individuals hold his evaluations, so he
tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world... aware that his effort

will be less than perfect yet undismayed by self-knowledge of selffailure."
"Hear, hear!" I said. "'Less than perfect.' What I've been aiming
for all my life."
"You've achieved it," said Wyoh. "Professor, your words sound good
but there is something slippery about them. Too much power in the hands
of individuals--surely you would not want... well, H-missiles for
example--to be controlled by one irresponsible person?"
"My point is that one person is responsible. Always. If H-bombs
exist--and they do--some man controls them. In tern of morals there is no
such thing as 'state.' Just men. Individuals. Each responsible for his
own acts."
"Anybody need a refill?" I asked.
Nothing uses up alcohol faster than political argument. I sent for
another bottle.
I did not take part. I was not dissatisfied back when we were
"ground under Iron Heel of Authority." I cheated Authority and rest of
time didn't think about it. Didn't think about getting rid of Authority-impossible. Go own way, mind own business, not be bothered-- True, didn't
have luxuries then; by Earthside standards we were poor. If had to be
imported, mostly did without; don't think there was a powered door in all
Luna. Even p-suits used to be fetched up from Terra--until a smart Chinee
before I was born figured how to make "monkey copies" better and simpler.
(Could dump two Chinee down in one of our maria and they would get rich
selling rocks to each other while raising twelve kids. Then a Hindu would
sell retail stuff he got from them wholesale--below cost at fat profit.
We got along.)
I had seen those luxuries Earthside. Wasn't worth what they put up
with. Don't mean heavy gravity, that doesn't bother them; I mean
nonsense. All time kukai moa. If chicken guano in one earthworm city were
shipped to Luna, fertilizer problem would be solved for century. Do this.
Don't do that. Stay back of line. Where's tax receipt? Fill out form.
Let's see license. Submit six copies. Exit only. No left turn. No right
turn. Queue up to pay fine. Take back and get stamped. Drop dead--but
first get permit.
Wyoh plowed doggedly into Prof, certain she had all answers. But
Prof was interested in questions rather than answers, which baffled her.
Finally she said, "Professor, I can't understand you. I don't insist that
you call it 'government'--I just want you to state what rules you think
are necessary to insure equal freedom for all."
"Dear lady, I'll happily accept your rules."
"But you don't seem to want any rules!"
"True. But I will accept any rules that you feel necessary to your
freedom. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them
tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I
am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything
I do."
"You would not abide by a law that the majority felt was
necessary?"
"Tell me what law, dear lady, and I will tell you whether I will
obey it."
"You wiggled out. Every time I state a general principle, you
wiggle out."

Prof clasped hands on chest. "Forgive me. Believe me, lovely
Wyoming, I am most anxious to please you. You spoke of willingness to
unite the front with anyone going your way. Is it enough that I want to
see the Authority thrown off Luna and would die to serve that end?"
Wyoh beamed. "It certainly is!" She fisted his ribs--gently--then
put arm around him and kissed cheek. "Comrade! Let's get on with it!"
"Cheers!" I said. "Let's fin' Warden 'n'
'liminate him!" Seemed a good idea; I had had a short night and
don't usually drink much.
Prof topped our glasses, held his high and announced with great
dignity: "Comrades... we declare the Revolution!"
That got us both kissed. But sobered me, as Prof sat down and said,
"The Emergency Committee of Free Luna is in session. We must plan
action."
I said, "Wait, Prof! I didn't agree to anything. What's this
'Action' stuff?"
"We will now overthrow the Authority," he said blandly.
"How? Going to throw rocks at 'em?"
"That remains to be worked out. This is the planning stage."
I said, "Prof, you know me. If kicking out Authority was thing we
could buy. I wouldn't worry about price."
"'--our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.'"
"Huh?"
"A price that once was paid."
"Well--I'd go that high. But when I bet I want a chance to win.
Told Wyoh last night I didn't object to long odds--"
"'One in ten' is what you said, Mannie."
"Da, Wyoh. Show me those odds, I'll tap pot. But can you?"
"No, Manuel, I can't."
"Then why we talk-talk? I can't see any chance."
"Nor I, Manuel. But we approach it differently. Revolution is an
art that I pursue rather than a goal I expect to achieve. Nor is this a
source of dismay; a lost cause can be as spiritually satisfying as a
victory."
"Not me. Sorry."
"Mannie," Wyoh said suddenly, "ask Mike."
I stared. "You serious?"
"Quite serious. If anyone can figure out odds, Mike should be able
to. Don't you think?"
"Um. Possible."
"Who, if I may ask," Prof put in, "is Mike?"
I shrugged. "Oh, just a nobody."
"Mike is Mannie's best friend. He's very good at figuring odds."
"A bookie? My dear, if we bring in a fourth party we start by
violating the cell principle."
"I don't see why," Wyoh answered. "Mike could be a member of the
cell Mannie will head."
"Mmm... true. I withdraw objection. He is safe? You vouch for him?
Or you, Manuel?"
I said, "He's dishonest, immature, practical joker, not interested
in politics."
"Mannie, I'm going to tell Mike you said that. Professor, he's
nothing of the sort--and we need him. Uh, in fact he might be our
chairman, and we three the cell under him. The executive cell."

"Wyoh, you getting enough oxygen?"
"I'm okay, I haven't been guzzling it the way you have. Think,
Mannie. Use imagination."
"I must confess," said Prof, "that I find these conflicting reports
very conflicting."
"Mannie?"
"Oh, hell." So we told him, between us, all about Mike, how he woke
up. got his name, met Wyoh. Prof accepted idea of a self-aware computer
easier than I accepted idea of snow first time I saw. Prof just nodded
and said, "Go on."
But presently he said, "This is the Warden's own computer? Why not
invite the Warden to our meetings and be done with it?"
We tried to reassure him. At last i said, "Put it this way. Mike is
his own boy, just as you are. Call him rational anarchist, for he's
rational and he feels no loyalty to any government."
"If this machine is not loyal to its owners, why expect it to be
loyal to you?"
"A feeling. I treat Mike well as I know how, he treats me same
way." I told how Mike had taken precautions to protect me. "I'm not sure
he could betray me to anyone who didn't have those signals, one to secure
phone, other to retrieve what I've talked about or stored with him;
machines don't think way people do. But feel dead sure he wouldn't want
to betray me and probably could protect me even if somebody got those
signals."
"Mannie," suggested Wyoh, "why not call him? Once Professor de la
Paz talks to him he will know why we trust Mike. Professor, we don't have
to tell Mike any secrets until you feel sure of him."
"I see no harm in that."
"Matter of fact," I admitted, "already told him some secrets." I
told them about recording last night's meeting and how I stored it.
Prof was distressed, Wyoh was worried. I said, "Damp it! Nobody but
me knows retrieval signal. Wyoh, you know how Mike behaved about your
pictures; won't let me have those pictures even though I suggested lock
on them. But if you two will stop oscillating, I'll call him, make sure
that nobody has retrieved that recording. and tell him to erase--then
it's gone forever, computer memory is all or nothing. Or can go one
better. Call Mike and have him play record back into recorder, wiping
storage. No huhu."
"Don't bother," said Wyoh. "Professor, I trust Mike--and so will
you."
"On second thought," Prof admitted, "I see little hazard from a
recording of last night's meeting. One that large always contains spies
and one of them may have used a recorder as you did, Manuel. I was upset
at what appeared to be your indiscretion--a weakness a member of a
conspiracy must never have, especially one at the top, as you are."
"Was not member of conspiracy when I fed that recording into Mike-and not now unless somebody quotes odds better than those so far!"
"I retract; you were not indiscreet. But are you seriously
suggesting that this machine can predict the outcome of a revolution?"
"Don't know."
"I think he can!" said Wyoh.
"Hold it, Wyoh. Prof, he could predict it fed all significant
data."

"That's my point, Manuel. I do not doubt that this machine can
solve problems I cannot grasp. But one of this scope? It would have to
know--oh, goodness!--all of human history, all details of the entire
social, political, and economic situation on Terra today and the same for
Luna, a wide knowledge of psychology in all its ramifications, a wide
knowledge of technology with all its possibilities, weaponry,
communications, strategy and tactics, agitprop techniques, classic
authorities such as Clausewitz, Guevera, Morgenstern, Machiavelli, many
others."
"Is that all?"
"'Is that all?' My dear boy!"
"Prof, how many history books have you read?"
"I do not know. In excess of a thousand."
"Mike can zip through that many this afternoon, speed limited only
by scanning method--he can store data much faster. Soon--minutes---he
would have every fact correlated with everything else he knows,
discrepancies noted, probability values assigned to uncertainties. Prof,
Mike reads every word of every newspaper up from Terra. Reads all
technical publications. Reads fiction--knows it's fiction--because isn't
enough to keep him busy and is always hungry for more. If is any book he
should read to solve this, say so. He can cram it down fast as I get it
to him."
Prof blinked. "I stand corrected. Very well, let us see if he can
cope with it. I still think there is something known as 'intuition' and
'human judgment.'"
"Mike has intuition," Wyoh said. "Feminine intuition, that is."
"As for 'human judgment,'" I added, "Mike isn't human. But all he
knows he got from humans. Let's get you acquainted and you judge his
judgment."
So I phoned. "Hi, Mike!"
"Hello, Man my only male friend. Greetings, Wyoh my only female
friend. I heard a third person. I conjecture that it may be Professor
Bernardo de la Paz."
Prof looked startled, then delighted. I said, "Too right, Mike.
That's why I called you; Professor is not-stupid."
"Thank you, Man! Professor Bernardo de la Paz, I am delighted to
meet you."
"I am delighted to meet you, too, sir." Prof hesitated, went on
"Mi--Señor Holmes, may I ask how you knew that I was here?"
"I am sorry, sir; I cannot answer. Man? 'You know my methods.'"
"Mike is being crafty, Prof. It involves something he learned doing
a confidential job for me. So he threw me a hint to let you think that he
had identified you by hearing your presence--and he can indeed tell much
from respiration and heartbeat... mass, approximate age, sex, and quite a
bit about health; Mike's medical storage is as full as any other."
"I am happy to say," Mike added seriously, "that I detect no signs
of cardiac or respiratory trouble, unusual for a man of the Professor's
age who has spent so many years Earthside. I congratulate you, sir."
"Thank you, Señor Holmes."
"My pleasure, Professor Bernardo de la Paz."
"Once he knew your identity, he knew how old you are, when you were
shipped and what for, anything that ever appeared about you in Lunatic or
Moonglow or any Lunar publication, including pictures--your bank balance,
whether you pay bills on time, and much more. Mike retrieved this in a

split second once he had your name. What he didn't tell--because was my
business--is that he knew I had invited you here, so it's a short jump to
guess that you're still here when he heard heartbeat and breathing that
matched you. Mike, no need to say 'Professor Bernardo de la Paz' each
time; 'Professor' or"Prof' is enough."
"Noted, Man. But he addressed me formally, with honorific."
"So both of you relax. Prof, you scan it? Mike knows much, doesn't
tell all, knows when to keep mouth shut."
"I am impressed!"
"Mike is a fair dinkum thinkum--you'll see. Mike, I bet Professor
three to two that Yankees would win pennant again. How chances?"
"I am sorry to hear it, Man. The correct odds, this early in the
year and based on past performances of teams and players, are one to four
point seven two the other way."
"Can't be that bad!"
"I'm sorry, Man. I will print out the calculations if you wish. But
I recommend that you buy back your wager. The Yankees have a favorable
chance to defeat any single team... but the combined chances of defeating
all teams in the league, including such factors as weather, accidents,
and other variables for the season ahead, place the club on the short end
of the odds I gave you."
"Prof, want to sell that bet?"
"Certainly, Manuel."
"Price?"
"Three hundred Hong Kong dollars."
"You old thief!"
"Manuel, as you former teacher I would be false to you if I did not
permit you to learn from mistakes. Señor Holmes--Mike my friend--May I
call you 'friend'?"
"Please do." (Mike almost purred.)
"Mike amigo, do you also tout horse races?"
"I often calculate odds on horse races; the civil service
computermen frequently program such requests. But the results are so at
variance with expectations that I have concluded either that the data are
too meager, or the horses or riders are not honest. Possibly all three.
However, I can give you a formula which will pay a steady return if
played consistently."
Prof looked eager. "What is it? May one ask?"
"One may. Bet the leading apprentice jockey to place. He is always
given good mounts and they carry less weight. But don't bet him on the
nose."
"'Leading apprentice'... hmm. Manuel, do you have the correct
time?"
"Prof, which do you want? Get a bet down before post time? Or
settle what we set out to?"
"Unh, sorry. Please carry on. 'Leading apprentice--'"
"Mike, I gave you a recording last night." I leaned close to
pickups and whispered: "Bastille Day."
"Retrieved, Man."
"Thought about it?"
"In many ways. Wyoh, you speak most dramatically."
"Thank you, Mike."
"Prof, can you get your mind off ponies?"
"Eh? Certainly, I am all ears."

"Then quit doing odds under your breath; Mike can do them faster."
"I was not wasting time; the financing of... joint ventures such as
ours is always difficult. However, I shall table it; I am all attention."
"I want Mike to do a trial projection. Mike, in that recording, you
heard Wyoh say we had to have free trade with Terra. You heard Prof say
we should clamp an embargo on shipping food to Terra. Who's right?"
"Your question is indeterminate, Man."
"What did I leave out?"
"Shall I rephrase it, Man?"
"Sure. Give us discussion."
"In immediate terms Wyoh's proposal would be of great advantage to
the people of Luna. The price of foodstuffs at catapult head would
increase by a factor of at least four. This takes into account a slight
rise in wholesale prices on Terra, 'slight' because the Authority now
sells at approximately the free market price. This disregards subsidized,
dumped, and donated foodstuffs, most of which come from the large profit
caused by the controlled low price at catapult head. I will say no more
about minor variables as they are swallowed by major ones. Let it stand
that the immediate effect here would be a price increase of the close
order of fourfold."
"Hear that, Professor?"
"Please, dear lady. I never disputed it."
"The profit increase to the grower is more than fourfold because,
as Wyoh pointed out, he now must buy water and other items at controlled
high prices. Assuming a free market throughout the sequence his profit
enhancement will be of the close order of sixfold. But this would be
offset by another factor: Higher prices for exports would cause higher
prices for everything consumed in Luna, goods and labor. The total effect
would be an enhanced standard of living for all on the close order of
twofold. This would be accompanied by vigorous effort to drill and seal
more farming tunnels, mine more ice, improve growing methods, all leading
to greater export. However, the Terran Market is so large and food
shortage so chronic that reduction in profit from increase of export is
not a major factor."
Prof said, "But, Señor Mike, that would only hasten the day that
Luna is exhausted!"
"The projection was specified as immediate, Señor Professor. Shall
I continue in longer range on the basis of your remarks?"
"By all means!"
"Luna's mass to three significant figures is seven point three six
times ten to the nineteenth power tonnes. Thus, holding other variables
constant including Lunar and Terran populations, the present differential
rate of export in tonnes could continue for seven point three six times
ten to the twelfth years before using up one percent of Luna--round it as
seven thousand billion years."
"What! Are you sure?"
"You are invited to check, Professor."
I said, "Mike, this a joke? If so, not funny even once!"
"It is not a joke, Man."
"Anyhow," Prof added, recovering, "it's not Luna's crust we are
shipping. It's our lifeblood--water and organic matter. Not rock."
"I took that into consideration, Professor. This projection is
based on controlled transmutation--any isotope into any other and

postulating power for any reaction not exo-energetic. Rock would be
shipped--transformed into wheat and beef and other foodstuffs."
"But we don't know how to do that! Amigo, this is ridiculous!"
"But we will know how to do it."
"Mike is right, Prof," I put in. "Sure, today we haven't a glimmer.
But will. Mike, did you compute how many years till we have this? Might
take a flier in stocks."
Mike answered in sad voice, "Man my only male friend save for the
Professor whom I hope will be my friend, I tried. I failed. The question
is indeterminate."
"Why?"
"Because it involves a break-through in theory. There is no way in
all my data to predict when and where genius may appear."
Prof sighed. "Mike amigo, I don't know whether to be relieved or
disappointed. Then that projection didn't mean anything?"
"Of course it meant something!" said Wyoh. "It means we'll dig it
out when we need it. Tell him, Mike!"
"Wyoh, I am most sorry. Your assertion is, in effect, exactly what
I was looking for. But the answer still remains: Genius is where you find
it. No. I am so sorry."
I said, "Then Prof is right? When comes to placing bets?"
"One moment, Man. There is a special solution suggested by the
Professor's speech last night--return shipping, tonne for tonne."
"Yes, but can't do that."
"If the cost is low enough, Terrans would do so. That can be
achieved with only minor refinement, not a break-through, to wit, freight
transportation up from Terra as cheap as catapulting down to Terra."
"You call this 'minor'?"
"I call it minor compared with the other problem, Man."
"Mike dear, how long? When do we get it?"
"Wyoh, a rough projection, based on poor data and largely
intuitive, would be on the order of fifty years."
"'Fifty years'? Why, that's nothing! We can have free trade."
"Wyoh, I said 'on the order of'--I did not say 'on the close order
of.'"
"It makes a difference?"
"Does." I told her. "What Mike said was that he doesn't expect it
sooner than five years but would be surprised if much longer than five
hundred--eh, Mike?"
"Correct, Man."
"So need another projection. Prof pointed out that we ship water
and organic matter and don't get it back---agree, Wyoh?"
"Oh. sure. I just don't think it's urgent. We'll solve it when we
reach it."
"Okay, Mike--no cheap shipping, no transmutation: How long till
trouble?"
"Seven years."
"'Seven years!'" Wyoh jumped up, stared at phone. "Mike honey! You
don't mean that?"
"Wyoh," he said plaintively, "I did my best. The problem has an
indeterminately large number of variables. I ran several thousand
solutions using many assumptions. The happiest answer came from assuming
no increase in tonnage, no increase in Lunar population--restriction of
births strongly enforced--and a greatly enhanced search for ice in order

to maintain the water supply. That gave an answer of slightly over twenty
years. All other answers were worse."
Wyoh, much sobered, said, "What happens in seven years?"
"The answer of seven years from now I reached by assuming the
present situation, no change in Authority policy, and all major variables
extrapolated from the empiricals implicit in their past behavior--a
conservative answer of highest probability from available data. Twentyeighty-two is the year I expect food riots. Cannibalism should not occur
for at least two years thereafter."
"'Cannibalism'!" She turned and buried head against Prof's chest.
He patted her, said gently, "I'm sorry, Wyoh. People do not realize
how precarious our ecology is. Even so, it shocks me. I know water runs
down hill... but didn't dream how terribly soon it will reach bottom."
She straightened up and face was calm. "Okay, Professor, I was
wrong. Embargo it must be--and all that that implies. Let's get busy.
Let's find out from Mike what our chances are. You trust him now--don't
you?"
"Yes, dear lady, I do. We must have him on our side. Well, Manuel?"
Took time to impress Mike with how serious we were, make him
understand that "jokes" could kill us (this machine who could not know
human death) and to get assurance that he could and would protect secrets
no matter what retrieval program was used--even our signals if not from
us. Mike was hurt that I could doubt him but matter too serious to risk
slip.
Then took two hours to program and re-program and change
assumptions and investigate side issues before all four--Mike, Prof,
Wyoh, self--were satisfied that we had defined it, i. e., what chance had
revolution--this revolution, headed by us, success required before "Food
Riots Day," against Authority with bare hands... against power of all
Terra, all eleven billions, to beat us down and inflict their will--all
with no rabbits out of hats, with certainty of betrayal and stupidity and
faintheartedness, and fact that no one of us was genius, nor important in
Lunar affairs. Prof made sure that Mike knew history, psychology,
economics, name it. Toward end Mike was pointing out far more variables
than Prof.
At last we agreed that programming was done--or that we could think
of no other significant factor. Mike then said, "This is an indeterminate
problem. How shall I solve it? Pessimistically? Or optimistically? Or a
range of probabilities expressed as a curve, or several curves? Professor
my friend?"
"Manuel?"
I said, "Mike, when I roll a die, it's one in six it turns ace. I
don't ask shopkeeper to float it, nor do I caliper it, or worry about
somebody blowing on it. Don't give happy answer, nor pessimistic; don't
shove curves at us. Just tell in one sentence: What chances? Even? One in
a thousand? None? Or whatever."
"Yes, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly my first male friend,"
For thirteen and a half minutes was no sound, while Wyoh chewed
knuckles. Never known Mike to take so long. Must have consulted every
book he ever read and worn edges off random numbers. Was beginning to
believe that he had been overloaded and either burnt out something or
gone into cybernetic breakdown that requires computer equivalent of
lobotomy to stop oscillations.
Finally he spoke. "Manuel my friend, I am terribly sorry!"

"What's trouble, Mike?"
"I have tried and tried, checked and checked. There is but one
chance in seven of winning!"

7
I look at Wyoh, she looks at me; we laugh. I jump up and yip, "Hooray!"
Wyoh starts to cry, throws arms around Prof, kisses him.
Mike said plaintively, "I do not understand. The chances are seven
to one against us. Not for us."
Wyoh stopped slobbering Prof and said, "Hear that? Mike said 'us.'
He included himself."
"Of course. Mike old cobber, we understood. But ever know a Loonie
to refuse to bet when he stood a big fat chance of one in seven?"
"I have known only you three. Not sufficient data for a curve."
"Well... we're Loonies. Loonies bet. Hell, we have to! They shipped
us up and bet us we couldn't stay alive. We fooled 'em. We'll fool 'em
again! Wyoh. Where's your pouch? Get red hat. Put on Mike. Kiss him.
Let's have a drink. One for Mike, too--want a drink, Mike?"
"I wish that I could have a drink," Mike answered wistfully, "as I
have wondered about the subjective effect of ethanol on the human nervous
system--I conjecture that it must be similar to a slight overvoltage. But
since I cannot, please have one in my place."
"Program accepted. Running. Wyoh, where's hat!" Phone was flat to
wall, let into rock--no place to hang hat. So we placed it on writing
shelf and toasted Mike and called him "Comrade!" and almost he cried. His
voice fugged up. Then Wyoh borrowed Liberty Cap and put on me and kissed
me into conspiracy, officially this time, and so all out that my eldest
wife would faint did she see--then she took hat and put on Prof and gave
him same treatment and I was glad Mike had reported his heart okay.
Then she put it on own head and went to phone, leaned close, mouth
between binaurals and made kissing sounds. "That's for you, Mike dear
comrade. Is Michelle there?"
Blimey if he didn't answer in soprano voice: "Right here, darling-and I am so 'appee!"
So Michelle got a kiss, and I had to explain to Prof who "Michelle"
was and introduce him. He was formal, sucking air and whistling and
clasping hands--sometimes I think Prof was not right in his head.
Wyoh poured more vodka. Prof caught her, mixed ours with coffee,
hers with chai, honey in all. "We have declared the Revolution," he said
firmly, "now we execute it. With clear heads. Manuel, you were opted
chairman. Shall we begin?"
"Mike is chairman," I said. "Obvious. Secretary, too. We'll never
keep anything in writing; first security rule. With Mike, don't need to.
Let's bat it around and see where we are; I'm new to business."
"And," said Prof, "still on the subject of security, the secret of
Mike should be restricted to this executive cell, subject to unanimous
agreement--all three of us--correction: all four of us--that is must be
extended."

"What secret?" asked Wyoh. "Mike agreed to help our secrets. He's
safer than we are; he can't be brainwashed, Can you be, Mike dear?"
"I could be brainwashed," Mike admitted, "by enough voltage. Or by
being smashed, or subjected to solvents, or positive entropy through
other means--I find the concept disturbing. But if by 'brainwashing' you
mean could I be compelled to surrender our secrets, the answer is an
unmodified negative."
I said, "Wye, Prof means secret of Mike himself. Mike old pal,
you're our secret weapon--you know that, don't you?"
He answered self-consciously, "It was necessary to take that into
consideration in computing the odds."
"How were odds without you, comrade? Bad?"
"They were not good. Not of the same order."
"Won't press you. But a secret weapon must be secret, Mike, does
anybody else suspect that you are alive?"
"Am I alive?" His voice held tragic loneliness.
"Uh, won't argue semantics. Sure, you're alive!"
"I was not sure. It is good to be alive. No, Mannie my first
friend, you three alone know it. My three friends."
"That's how must be if bet's to pay off. Is okay? Us three and
never talk to anybody else?"
"But we'll talk to you lots!" Wyoh put in.
"It is not only okay," Mike said bluntly, "it is necessary. It was
a factor in the odds."
"That settles it," I said. "They have everything else; we have
Mike. We keep it that way. Say! Mike, I just had a horrid. We fight
Terra?"
"We will fight Terra... unless we lose before that time."
"Uh, riddle this. Any computers smart as you? Any awake?"
He hesitated. "I don't know, Man."
"No data?"
"Insufficient data. I have watched for both factors, not only in
technical journals but everywhere else. There are no computers on the
market of my present capacity... but one of my model could be augmented
just as I have been. Furthermore an experimental computer of great
capacity might be classified and go unreported in the literature."
"Mmm... chance we have to take."
"Yes, Man."
"There aren't any computers as smart as Mike!" Wyoh said
scornfully. "Don't be silly, Mannie."
"Wyoh, Man was not being silly. Man, I saw one disturbing report.
It was claimed that attempts are being made at the University of Peiping
to combine computers with human brains to achieve massive capacity. A
computing Cyborg."
"They say how?"
"The item was non-technical."
"Well... won't worry about what can't help. Right, Prof?"
"Correct, Manuel. A revolutionist must keep his mind free of worry
or the pressure becomes intolerable."
"I don't believe a word of it," Wyoh added. "We've got Mike and
we're going to win! Mike dear, you say we're going to fight Terra--and
Mannie says that's one battle we can't win. You have some idea of how we
can win, or you wouldn't have given us even one chance in seven. So what
is it?"

"Throw rocks at them," Mike answered.
"Not funny," I told him. "Wyoh, don't borrow trouble. Haven't even
settled how we leave this pooka without being nabbed. Mike, Prof says
nine guards were killed last night and Wyoh says twenty-seven is whole
bodyguard. Leaving eighteen. Do you know if that's true, do you know
where they are and what they are up to? Can't put on a revolution if we
dasn't stir out."
Prof interrupted. "That's a temporary exigency, Manuel, one we can
cope with. The point Wyoming raised is basic and should be discussed. And
daily, until solved. I am interested in Mike's thoughts."
"Okay, okay--but will you wait while Mike answers me?"
"Sorry, sir."
"Mike?"
"Mike?"
"Man, the official number of Warden's bodyguards is twenty-seven.
If nine were killed the official number is now eighteen."
"You keep saying 'official number.' Why?"
"I have incomplete data which might be relevant. Let me state them
before advancing even tentative conclusions. Nominally the Security
Officer's department aside from clerks consists only of the bodyguard.
But I handle payrolls for Authority Complex and twenty-seven is not the
number of personnel charged against the Security Department."
Prof nodded. "Company spies."
"Hold it, Prof. Who are these other people?"
Mike answered, "They are simply account numbers, Man. I conjecture
that the names they represent are in the Security Chiefs data storage
location."
"Wait, Mike. Security Chief Alvarez uses you for files?"
"I conjecture that to be true, since his storage location is under
a locked retrieval signal."
I said, "Bloody," and added, "Prof, isn't that sweet? He uses Mike
to keep records, Mike knows where they are--can't touch 'em!"
"Why not, Manuel?"
Tried to explain to Prof and Wyoh sorts of memory a thinkum has-permanent memories that can't be erased because patterns be logic itself,
how it thinks; short-term memories used for current programs and then
erased like memories which tell you whether you have honeyed coffee;
temporary memories held long as necessary--milliseconds, days, years--but
erased when no longer needed; permanently stored data like a human
being's education--but learned perfectly and never forgotten--though may
be condensed, rearranged, relocated, edited--and last but not finally,
long lists of special memories ranging from memoranda files through very
complex special programs, and each location tagged by own retrieval
signal and locked or not, with endless possibilities on lock signals:
sequential, parallel, temporal, situational, others.
Don't explain computers to laymen. Simpler to explain sex to a
virgin. Wyoh couldn't see why, if Mike knew where Alvarez kept records,
Mike didn't trot over and fetch.
I gave up. "Mike, can you explain?"
"I will try, Man. Wyoh, there is no way for me to retrieve locked
data other than through external programming. I cannot program myself for
such retrieval; my logic structure does not permit it. I must receive the
signal as an external input."
"Well, for Bog's sake, what is this precious signal?"

"It is," Mike said simply, "'Special File Zebra'"--and waited.
"Mike!" I said. "Unlock Special File Zebra." He did, and stuff
started spilling out. Had to convince Wyoh that Mike hadn't been
stubborn. He hadn't--he almost begged us to tickle him on that spot.
Sure, he knew signal. Had to. But had to come from outside, that was how
he was built.
"Mike, remind me to check with you all special-purpose lockedretrieval signals. May strike ice other places."
"So I conjectured, Man."
"Okay, we'll get to it later. Now back up and go over this stuff
slowly--and, Mike, as you read out, store again, without erasing, under
Bastille Day and tag it 'Fink File.' Okay?"
"Programmed and running."
"Do that with anything new he puts in, too."
Prime prize was list of names by warrens, some two hundred, each
keyed with a code Mike identified with those blind pay accounts.
Mike read out Hong Kong Luna list and was hardly started when Wyoh
gasped, "Stop, Mike! I've got to write these down!"
I said, "Hey! No writing! What's huhu?"
"That woman, Sylvia Chiang, is comrade secretary back home! But-But that means the Warden has our whole organization!"
"No, dear Wyoming," Prof corrected. "It means we have his
organization."
"But--"
"I see what Prof means," I told her. "Our organization is just us
three and Mike. Which Warden doesn't know. But now we know his
organization. So shush and let Mike read. But don't write; you have this
list--from Mike--anytime you phone him. Mike, note that Chiang woman is
organization secretary, former organization, in Kongville."
"Noted."
Wyoh boiled over as she heard names of undercover finks in her town
but limited herself to noting facts about ones she knew. Not all were
"comrades" but enough that she stayed riled up. Novy Leningrad names
didn't mean much to us; Prof recognized three, Wyoh one. When came Luna
City Prof noted over half as being "comrades." I recognized several, not
as fake subversives but as acquaintances. Not friends--Don't know what it
would do to me to find someone I trusted on boss fink's payroll. But
would shake me.
It shook Wyoh. When Mike finished she said, "I've got to get home!
Never in my life have I helped eliminate anyone but I am going to enjoy
putting the black on these spies!"
Prof said quietly, "No one will be eliminated, dear Wyoming."
"What? Professor, can't you take it? Though I've never killed
anyone, I've always known it might have to be done."
He shook head. "Killing is not the way to handle a spy, not when he
doesn't know that you know that he is a spy."
She blinked. "I must be dense."
"No, dear lady. Instead you have a charming honesty... a weakness
you must guard against. The thing to do with a spy is to let him breathe,
encyst him with loyal comrades, and feed him harmless information to
please his employers. These creatures will be taken into our
organization. Don't be shocked; they will be in very special cells.
'Cages' is a better word. But it would be the greatest waste to eliminate
them--not only would each spy be replaced with someone new but also

killing these traitors would tell the Warden that we have penetrated his
secrets. Mike amigo mio, there should be in that file a dossier on me.
Will you see?"
Were long notes on Prof, and I was embarrassed as they added up to
"harmless old fool." He was tagged as a subversive--that was why he had
been sent to The Rock--as a member of underground group in Luna City. But
was described as a "troublemaker" in organization, one who rarely agreed
with others.
Prof dimpled and looked pleased. "I must consider trying to sell
out and get myself placed on the Warden's payroll." Wyoh did not think
this funny, especially when he made clear was not joke, merely unsure
tactic was practical. "Revolutions must be financed, dear lady, and one
way is for a revolutionary to become a police spy. It is probable that
some of those prima-facie traitors are actually on our side."
"I wouldn't trust them!"
"Ah, yes, that is the rub with double agents, to be certain where
their loyalties--if any--lie. Do you wish your own dossier? Or would you
rather hear it in private?"
Wyoh's record showed no surprises. Warden's finks had tabbed her
years back. But I was surprised that I had a record, too--routine check
made when I was cleared to work in Authority Complex. Was classed as
"non-political" and someone had added "not too bright" which was both
unkind and true or why would I get mixed up in Revolution?
Prof had Mike stop read-out (hours more), leaned back and looked
thoughtful. "One thing is clear," he said. "The Warden knew plenty about
Wyoming and myself long ago. But you, Manuel, are not on his black list."
"After last night?"
"Ah, so. Mike, do you have anything In that file entered in the
last twenty-four hours?"
Nothing. Prof said, "Wyoming is right that we cannot stay here
forever. Manuel, how many names did you recognize? Six, was it? Did you
see any of them last night?"
"No. But might have seen me."
"More likely they missed you in the crowd. I did not spot you until
I came down front and I've known you since you were a boy. But it is most
unlikely that Wyoming traveled from Hong Kong and spoke at the meeting
without her activity being known to the Warden." He looked at Wyoh. "Dear
lady, could you bring yourself to play the nominal role of an old man's
folly?"
"I suppose so. How, Professor?"
"Manuel is probably in the clear. I am not but from my dossier it
seems unlikely that the Authority's finks will bother to pick me up. You
they may wish to question or even to hold; you are rated as dangerous. It
would be wise for you to stay out of sight. This room--I'm thinking of
renting it for a period--weeks or even years. You could hide in it--if
you do not mind the obvious construction that would be placed on your
staying here."
Wyoh chuckled. "Why, you darling! Do you think I care what anyone
thinks? I'd be delighted to play the role of your bundle baby--and don't
be too sure I'd be just playing."
"Never tease an old dog," he said mildly. "He might still have one
bite. I may occupy that couch most nights. Manuel, I intend to resume my
usual ways--and so should you. While I feel that it will take a busy
cossack to arrest me, I will sleep sounder in this hideaway. But in

addition to being a hideout this room is good for cell meetings; it has a
phone."
Mike said, "Professor, may I offer a suggestion?"
"Certainly, amigo, we want your thoughts."
"I conclude that the hazards increase with each meeting of our
executive cell. But meetings need not be corporal; you can meet--and I
can join you if I am welcome--by phone."
"You are always welcome, Comrade Mike; we need you. However--" Prof
looked worried.
I said, "Prof, don't worry about anybody listening in." I explained
how to place a "Sherlock" call. "Phones are safe if Mike supervises call.
Reminds me--You haven't been told how to reach Mike. How, Mike? Prof use
my number?"
Between them, they settled on MYSTERIOUS. Prof and Mike shared
childlike joy in intrigue for own sake. I suspect Prof enjoyed being
rebel long before he worked out his political philosophy, while Mike--how
could human freedom matter to him? Revolution was a game--a game that
gave him companionship and chance to show off talents. Mike was as
conceited a machine as you are ever likely to meet.
"But we still need this room," Prof said, reached into pouch,
hauled out thick wad of bills.
I blinked. "Prof, robbed a bank?"
"Not recently. Perhaps again in the future of the Cause requires
it. A rental period of one lunar should do as a starter. Will you arrange
it, Manuel? The management might be surprised to hear my voice; I came in
through a delivery door."
I called manager, bargained for dated key, four weeks. He asked
nine hundred Hong Kong. I offered nine hundred Authority. He wanted to
know how many would use room? I asked if was policy of Raffles to snoop
affairs of guests?
We settled at HK$475; I sent up bills, he sent down two dated keys.
I gave one to Wyoh, one to Prof, kept one-day key, knowing they would not
reset lock unless we failed to pay at end of lunar.
(Earthside I ran into insolent practice of requiring hotel guest to
sign chop--even show identification!)
I asked, "What next? Food?"
"I'm not hungry, Mannie."
"Manuel, you asked us to wait while Mike settled your questions.
Let's get back to the basic problem: how we are to cope when we find
ourselves facing Terra, David facing Goliath."
"Oh. Been hoping that would go away. Mike? You really have ideas?"
"I said I did, Man," he answered plaintively. "We can throw rocks."
"Bog's sake! No time for jokes."
"But, Man," he protested, "we can throw rocks at Terra. We will."

Took time to get through my skull that Mike was serious, and scheme might
work. Then took longer to show Wyoh and Prof how second part was true.
Yet both parts should have been obvious.
Mike reasoned so: What is "war"? One book defined war as use of
force to achieve political result. And "force" is action of one body on
another applied by means of energy.
In war this is done by "weapons"--Luna had none. But weapons, when
Mike examined them as class, turned out to be engines for manipulating
energy--and energy Luna has plenty. Solar flux alone is good for around
one kilowatt per square meter of surface at Lunar noon; sunpower, though
cyclic, is effectively unlimited. Hydrogen fusion power is almost as
unlimited and cheaper, once ice is mined, magnetic pinchbottle set up.
Luna has energy--how to use?
But Luna also has energy of position; she sits at top of gravity
well eleven kilometers per second deep and kept from falling in by curb
only two and a half km/s high. Mike knew that curb; daily he tossed grain
freighters over it, let them slide downhill to Terra.
Mike had computed what would happen if a freighter grossing 100
tonnes (or same mass of rock) falls to Terra, unbraked.
Kinetic energy as it hits is 6 .25 x 10^12 joules--over six
trillion joules.
This converts in split second to heat. Explosion, big one!
Should have been obvious. Look at Luna: What you see? Thousands on
thousands of craters--places where Somebody got playful throwing rocks.
Wyoh said, "Joules don't mean much to me. How does that compare
with H-bombs?"
"Uh--" I started to round off in head. Mike's "head" works faster;
he answered, "The concussion of a hundred-tonne mass on Terra approaches
the yield of a two-kilotonne atomic bomb."
"'Kilo' is a thousand," Wyoh murmured, "and 'mega' is a million-Why, that's only one fifty-thousandth as much as a hundred-megatonne
bomb. Wasn't that the size Sovunion used?"
"Wyoh, honey," I said gently, "that's not how it works. Turn it
around. A two-kilotonne yield is equivalent to exploding two million
kilograms of trinitrotoluol... and a kilo of TNT is quite an explosion-Ask any drillman. Two million kilos will wipe out good-sized town. Check,
Mike?"
"Yes, Man. But, Wyoh my only female friend, there is another
aspect. Multi-megatonne fusion bombs are inefficient. The explosion takes
place in too small a space; most of it is wasted. While a hundredmegatonne bomb is rated as having fifty thousand times the yield of a
two-kilotonne bomb, its destructive effect is only about thirteen hundred
times as great as that of a two-kilotonne explosion."
"But it seems to me that thirteen hundred times is still quite a
lot--if they are going to use bombs on us that much bigger."
"True, Wyoh my female friend... but Luna has many rocks."
"Oh. Yes, so we have."
"Comrades," said Prof, "this is outside my competence--in my
younger or bomb-throwing days my experience was limited to something of
the order of the one-kilogram chemical explosion of which you spoke,
Manuel. But I assume that you two know what you are talking about."
"We do," Mike agreed.
"So I accept your figures. To bring it down to a scale that I can
understand this plan requires that we capture the catapult. No?"

"Yes," Mike and I chorused.
"Not impossible. Then we must hold it and keep it operative. Mike,
have you considered how your catapult can be protected against, let us
say, one small H-tipped torpedo?"
Discussion went on and on. We stopped to eat--stopped business
under Prof's rule. Instead Mike told jokes, each produced a that-remindsme from Prof.
By time we left Raffles Hotel evening of 14th May '75 we had--Mike
had, with help from Prof--outlined plan of Revolution, including major
options at critical points.
When came time to go, me to home and Prof to evening class (if not
arrested), then home for bath and clothes and necessities in case he
returned that night, became clear Wyoh did not want to be alone in
strange hotel--Wyoh was stout when bets were down, between times soft and
vulnerable.
So I called Mum on a Sherlock and told her was bringing house guest
home. Mum ran her job with style; any spouse could bring guest home for
meal or year, and our second generation was almost as free but must ask.
Don't know how other families work; we have customs firmed by a century;
they suit us.
So Mum didn't ask name, age, sex, marital condition; was my right
and she too proud to ask. All she said was: "That's nice, dear. Have you
two had dinner? It's Tuesday, you know."
"Tuesday" was to remind me that our family had eaten early because
Greg preaches Tuesday evenings. But if guest had not eaten, dinner would
be served--concession to guest, not to me, as with exception of Grandpaw
we ate when was on table or scrounged standing up in pantry.
I assured her we had eaten and would make tall effort to be there
before she needed to leave. Despite Loonie mixture of Muslims, Jews,
Christians, Buddhists, and ninety-nine other flavors, I suppose Sunday is
commonest day for church. But Greg belongs to sect which had calculated
that sundown Tuesday to sundown Wednesday, local time Garden of Eden
(zone minus-two, Terra) was the Sabbath. So we ate early in Terran northhemisphere summer months.
Mum always went to hear Greg preach, so was not considerate to
place duty on her that would clash. All of us went occasionally; I
managed several times a year because terribly fond of Greg, who taught me
one trade and helped me switch to another when I had to and would gladly
have made it his arm rather than mine. But Mum always went--ritual not
religion, for she admitted to me one night in pillow talk that she had no
religion with a brand on it, then cautioned me not to tell Greg. I
exacted same caution from her. I don't know Who is cranking; I'm pleased
He doesn't stop.
But Greg was Mum's "boy husband," opted when she was very young,
first wedding after her own--very sentimental about him, would deny
fiercely if accused of loving him more than other husbands, yet took his
faith when he was ordained and never missed a Tuesday.
She said, "Is it possible that your guest would wish to attend
church?"
I said would see but anyhow we would rush, and said goodbye. Then
banged on bathroom door and said, "Hurry with skin, Wyoh; we're short on
minutes."
"One minute!" she called out. She's ungirlish girl; she appeared in
one minute. "How do I look?" she asked. "Prof, will I pass?"

"Dear Wyoming, I am amazed. You were beautiful before, you are
beautiful now--but utterly unrecognizable. You're safe--and I am
relieved."
Then we waited for Prof to transform into old derelict; he would be
it to his back corridor, then reappear as well-known teacher in front of
class, to have witnesses in case a yellow boy was waiting to grab him.
It left a moment; I told Wyoh about Greg. She said, "Mannie, how
good is this makeup? Would it pass in church? How bright are the lights?"
"No brighter than here. Good job, you'll get by. But do you want to
go to church? Nobody pushing."
She thought. "It would please your moth--I mean, 'your senior
wife,' would it not?"
I answered slowly, "Wyoh, religion is your pidgin. But since you
ask... yes, nothing would start you better in Davis Family than going to
church with Mum. I'll go if you do."
"I'll go. I thought your last name was 'O'Kelly'?"
"Is. Tack 'Davis' on with hyphen if want to be formal. Davis is
First Husband, dead fifty years. Is family name and all our wives are
'Gospazha Davis' hyphened with every male name in Davis line plus her
family name. In practice Mum is only 'Gospazha Davis'--can call her that-and others use first name and add Davis if they write a cheque or
something. Except that Ludmilla is 'Davis-Davis' because proud of double
membership, birth and option."
"I see. Then if a man is 'John Davis,' he's a son, but if he has
some other last name he's your co-husband. But a girl would be 'Jenny
Davis' either way, wouldn't she? How do I tell? By her age? No, that
wouldn't help. I'm confused! And I thought clan marriages were complex.
Or polyandries--though mine wasn't; at least my husbands had the same
last name."
"No trouble. When you hear a woman about forty address a fifteenyear-old as 'Mama Milla," you'll know which is wife and which is
daughter--not even that complex as we don't have daughters home past
husband-high; they get opted. But might be visiting. Your husbands were
named 'Knott'?"
"Oh, no, 'Fedoseev, Choy Lin and Choy Mu.' I took back my born
name."
Out came Prof, cackled senilely (looked even worse than earlier!),
we left by three exits, made rendezvous in main corridor, open formation.
Wyoh and I did not walk together, as I might be nabbed; on other hand she
did not know Luna City, a warren so complex even nativeborn get lost--so
I led and she had to keep me in sight. Prof trailed to make sure she
didn't lose me.
If I was picked up, Wyoh would find public phone, report to Mike,
then return to hotel and wait for Prof. But I felt sure that any yellow
jacket who arrested me would get a caress from number-seven arm.
No huhu. Up to level five and crosstown by Carver Causeway, up to
level three and stop at Tube Station West to pick up arms and tool kit-but not p-suit; would not have been in character, I stored it there. One
yellow uniform at station, showed no interest in me. South by welllighted corridors until necessary to go outward to reach private easement
lock thirteen to co-op pressure tunnel serving Davis Tunnels and a dozen
other farms. I suppose Prof dropped off there but I never looked back.
I delayed locking through our door until Wyoh caught up, then soon
was saying, "Mum, allow me to present Wyma Beth Johnson."

Mum took her in arms, kissed cheek, said, "So glad you could come,
Wyma dear! Our house is yours!"
See why I love our old biddy? Could have quick-frosted Wyoh with
same words--but was real and Wyoh knew.
Hadn't warned Wyoh about switch in names, thought of it en route.
Some of our kids were small and while they grew up despising Warden, no
sense in risking prattle about "Wyoming Knott, who's visiting us"--that
name was listed in "Special File Zebra."
So I missed warning her, was new to conspiracy.
But Wyoh caught cue and never bobbled.
Greg was in preaching clothes and would have to leave in minutes.
Mum did not hurry, took Wyoh down line of husbands--Grandpaw, Greg, Hans-then up line of wives--Ludmilla, Lenore, Sidris, Anna--with stately
grace, then started on our kids.
I said, "Mum? Excuse me, want to change arms." Her eyebrows went up
a millimeter, meaning: "We'll speak of this but not in front of
children"--so I added: "Know it's late, Greg's sneaking look at watch.
And Wyma and I are going to church. So 'scuse, please."
She relaxed. "Certainly, dear." As she turned away I saw her arm go
around Wyoh's waist, so I relaxed.
I changed arms, replacing number seven with social arm. But was
excuse to duck into phone cupboard and punch "MYCROFTXXX."
"Mike, we're home. But about to go to church. Don't think you can
listen there, so I'll check in later. Heard from Prof?"
"Not yet, Man. Which church is it? I may have some circuit."
"Pillar of Fire Repentance Tabernacle--"
"No reference."
"Slow to my speed, pal. Meets in West-Three Community Hall. That's
south of Station on Ring about number--."
"I have it. There's a pickup inside for channels and a phone in the
corridor outside; I'll keep an ear on both."
"I don't expect trouble, Mike."
"It's what Professor said to do. He is reporting now. Do you wish
to speak to him?"
"No time. 'Bye!"
That set pattern: Always keep touch with Mike, let him know where
you are, where you plan to be; Mike would listen if he had nerve ends
there. Discovery I made that morning, that Mike could listen at dead
phone, suggested it--discovery bothered me; don't believe in magic. But
on thinking I realized a phone could be switched on by central switching
system without human intervention--if switching system had volition. Mike
had bolshoyeh volition.
How Mike knew a phone was outside that hall is hard to say, since
"space" could not mean to him what means to us. But he carried in storage
a "map"--structured relations--of Luna City's engineering, and could
almost always fit what we said to what he knew as "Luna City"; hardly
ever got lost.
So from day cabal started we kept touch with Mike and each other
through his widespread nervous system. Won't mention again unless
necessary.
Mum and Greg and Wyoh were waiting at outer door, Mum chomping but
smiling. I saw she had lent Wyoh a stole; Mum was as easy about skin as
any Loonie, nothing newchummish--but church was another matter.

We made it, although Greg went straight to platform and we to
seats. I settled in warm, mindless state, going through motions. But Wyoh
did really listen to Greg's sermon and either knew our hymn book or was
accomplished sight reader.
When we got home, young ones were in bed and most adults; Hans and
Sidris were up and Sidris served cocoasoy and cookies, then all turned
in. Mum assigned Wyoh a room in tunnel most of our kids lived in, one
which had had two smaller boys last time I noticed. Did not ask how she
had reshuffled, was clear she was giving my guest best we had, or would
have put Wyoh with one of older girls.
I slept with Mum that night, partly because our senior wife is good
for nerves--and nerve-racking things had happened--and partly so she
would know I was not sneaking to Wyoh's room after things were quiet. My
workshop, where I slept when slept alone; was just one bend from Wyoh's
door. Mum was telling me, plain as print: "Go ahead, dear. Don't tell me
if you wish to be mean about it. Sneak behind my back."
Which neither of us admitted. We visited as we got ready for bed,
chatted after light out, then I turned over.
Instead of saying goodnight Mum said, "Manuel? Why does your sweet
little guest make herself up as an Afro? I would think that her natural
coloration would be more becoming. Not that she isn't perfectly charming
the way she chooses to be."
So rolled over and faced her, and explained--sounded thin, so
filled in. And found self telling all--except one point: Mike. I included
Mike--but not as computer--instead as a man Mum was not likely to meet,
for security reasons.
But telling Mum--taking her into my subcell, should say, to become
leader of own cell in turn--taking Mum into conspiracy was not case of
husband who can't keep from blurting everything to his wife. At most was
hasty--but was best time if she was to be told.
Mum was smart. Also able executive; running big family without
baring teeth requires that. Was respected among farm families and
throughout Luna City; she had been up longer than 90 percent. She could
help.
And would be indispensable inside family. Without her help Wyoh and
I would find it sticky to use phone together (hard to explain), keep kids
from noticing (impossible!)--but with Mum's help would be no problems
inside household.
She listened, sighed, said, "It sounds dangerous, dear."
"Is," I said. "Look, Mimi, if you don't want to tackle, say so then
forget what I've told."
"Manuel! Don't even say that. You are my husband, dear; I took you
for better, for worse... and your wish is my command."
(My word, what a lie! But Mimi believed it.)
"I would not let you go into danger alone," she went on, "and
besides--"
"What, Mimi?"
"I think every Loonie dreams of the day when we will be free. All
but some poor spineless rats. I've never talked about it; there seemed to
be no point and it's necessary to look up, not down, lift one's burden
and go ahead. But I thank dear Bog that I have been permitted to live to
see the time come, if indeed it has. Explain more about it. I am to find
three others, is it? Three who can be trusted."
"Don't hurry. Move slowly. Be sure."

"Sidris can be trusted. She holds her tongue, that one."
"Don't think you should pick from family. Need to spread out. Don't
rush."
"I shan't. We'll talk before I do anything. And Manuel, if you want
my opinion--" She stopped.
"Always want your opinion, Mimi."
"Don't mention this to Grandpaw. He's forgetful these days and
sometimes talkative. Now sleep, dear, and don't dream."

9
Followed a long time during which would have been possible to forget
anything as unlikely as revolution had not details taken so much time.
Our first purpose was not to be noticed. Long distance purpose was to
make things as much worse as possible.
Yes, worse. Never was a time, even at last, when all Loonies wanted
to throw off Authority, wanted it bad enough to revolt. All Loonies
despised Warden and cheated Authority. Didn't mean they were ready to
fight and die. If you had mentioned "patriotism" to a Loonie, he would
have stared--or thought you were talking about his homeland. Were
transported Frenchmen whose hearts belonged to "La Belle Patrie," exGermans loyal to Vaterland, Russkis who still loved Holy Mother Russia.
But Luna? Luna was "The Rock," place of exile, not thing to love.
We were as non-political a people as history ever produced. I know,
I was as numb to politics as any until circumstances pitched me into it.
Wyoming was in it because she hated Authority for a personal reason, Prof
because he despised all authority in a detached intellectual fashion,
Mike because he was a bored and lonely machine and was for him "only game
in town." You could not have accused us of patriotism. I came closest
because I was third generation with total lack of affection for any place
on Terra, had been there, disliked it and despised earthworms. Made me
more "patriotic" than most!
Average Loonie was interested in beer, betting, women, and work, in
that order. "Women" might be second place but first was unlikely, much as
women were cherished. Loonies had learned there never were enough women
to go around. Slow learners died, as even most possessive male can't stay
alert every minute. As Prof says, a society adapts to fact, or doesn't
survive. Loonies adapted to harsh facts--or failed and died. But
"patriotism" was not necessary to survival.
Like old Chinee saying that "Fish aren't aware of water," I was not
aware of any of this until I first went to Terra and even then did not
realize what a blank spot was in Loonies under storage location marked
"patriotism" until I took part in effort to stir them up. Wyoh and her
comrades had tried to push "patriotism" button and got nowhere--years of
work, a few thousand members, less than 1 percent and of that microscopic
number almost 10 percent had been paid spies of boss fink!
Prof set us straight: Easier to get people to hate than to get them
to love.

Luckily, Security Chief Alvarez gave us a hand. Those nine dead
finks were replaced with ninety, for Authority was goaded into something
it did reluctantly, namely spend money on us, and one folly led to
another.
Warden's bodyguard had never been large even in earliest days
Prison guards in historical meaning were unnecessary and that had been
one attraction of penal colony system--cheap. Warden and his deputy had
to be protected and visiting vips, but prison itself needed no guards.
They even stopped guarding ships after became clear was not necessary,
and in May 2075, bodyguard was down to its cheapest numbers, all of them
new chum transportees.
But loss of nine in one night scared somebody. We knew it scared
Alvarez; he filed copies of his demands for help in Zebra file and Mike
read them. A lag who had been a police officer on Terra before his
conviction and then a bodyguard all his years in Luna, Alvarez was
probably most frightened and loneliest man in The Rock. He demanded more
and tougher help, threatened to resign civil service job if he didn't get
it--just a threat, which Authority would have known if it had really
known Luna. If Alvarez had showed up in any warren as unarmed civilian,
he would have stayed breathing only as long as not recognized.
He got his additional guards. We never found out who ordered that
raid. Mort the Wart had never shown such tendencies, had been King Log
throughout tenure. Perhaps Alvarez, having only recently succeeded to
boss fink spot, wanted to make face--may have had ambition to be Warden.
But likeliest theory is that Warden's reports on "subversive activities"
caused Authority Earthside to order a cleanup.
One thumb-fingered mistake led to another. New bodyguards, instead
of picked from new transportees, were elite convict troops, Federated
Nations crack Peace Dragoons. Were mean and tough, did not want to go to
Luna, and soon realized that "temporary police duty" was one-way trip.
Hated Luna and Loonies, and saw us as cause of it all.
Once Alvarez got them, he posted a twenty-four-hour watch at every
interwarren tube station and instituted passports and passport control.
Would have been illegal had there been laws in Luna, since 95 percent of
us were theoretically free, either born free, or sentence completed.
Percentage was higher in cities as undischarged transportees lived in
barrack warrens at Complex and came into town only two days per lunar
they had off work. If then, as they had no money, but you sometimes saw
them wandering around, hoping somebody would buy a drink.
But passport system was not "illegal" as Warden's regulations were
only written law. Was announced in papers, we were given week to get
passports, and at eight hundred one morning was put in effect. Some
Loonies hardly ever traveled; some traveled on business; some commuted
from outlying warrens or even from Luna City to Novylen or other way.
Good little boys filled out applications, paid fees, were photographed,
got passes; I was good little boy on Prof's advice, paid for passport and
added it to pass I carried to work in Complex.
Few good little boys! Loonies did not believe it. Passports?
Whoever heard of such a thing?
Was a trooper at Tube Station South that morning dressed in
bodyguard yellow rather than regimentals and looking like he hated it,
and us. I was not going anywhere; I hung back and watched.
Novylen capsule was announced; crowd of thirty-odd headed for gate.
Gospodin Yellow Jacket demanded passport of first to reach it. Loonie

stopped to argue. Second one pushed past; guard turned and yelled--three
or four more shoved past. Guard reached for sidearm; somebody grabbed his
elbow, gun went off--not a laser, a slug gun, noisy.
Slug hit decking and went whee-whee-hoo off somewhere. I faded
back. One man hurt--that guard. When first press of passengers had gone
down ramp, he was on deck, not moving.
Nobody paid attention; they walked around or stepped over--except
one woman carrying a baby, who stopped, kicked him carefully in face,
then went down ramp. He may have been dead already, didn't wait to see.
Understand body stayed there till relief arrived.
Next day was a half squad in that spot. Capsule for Novylen left
empty.
It settled down. Those who had to travel got passports, diehards
quit traveling. Guard at a tube gate became two men, one looked at
passports while other stood back with gun drawn. One who checked
passports did not try hard, which was well as most were counterfeit and
early ones were crude. But before long, authentic paper was stolen and
counterfeits were as dinkum as official ones--more expensive but Loonies
preferred free-enterprise passports.
Our organization did not make counterfeits; we merely encouraged
it--and knew who had them and who did not; Mike's records listed
officially issued ones. This helped separate sheep from goats in files we
were building--also stored in Mike but in "Bastille" location--as we
figured a man with counterfeit passport was halfway to joining us. Word
was passed down cells in our growing organization never to recruit
anybody with a valid passport. If recruiter was not certain, just query
upwards and answer came back.
But guards' troubles were not over. Does not help a guard's dignity
nor add to peace of mind to have children stand in front of him, or
behind out of eye which was worse, and ape every move he makes--or run
back and forth screaming obscenities, jeering, making finger motions that
are universal. At least guards took them as insults.
One guard back-handed a small boy, cost him some teeth. Result: two
guards dead, one Loonie dead.
After that, guards ignored children.
We didn't have to work this up; we merely encouraged it. You
wouldn't think that a sweet old lady like my senior wife would encourage
children to misbehave. But she did.
Other things get single men a long way from home upset--and one we
did start. These Peace Dragoons had been sent to The Rock without a
comfort detachment.
Some of our fems were extremely beautiful and some started
loitering around stations, dressed in less than usual--which could
approach zero--and wearing more than usual amount of perfume, scents with
range and striking power. They did not speak to yellow jackets nor look
at them; they simply crossed their line of sight, undulating as only a
Loonie gal can. (A female on Terra can't walk that way; she's tied down
by six times too much weight.)
Such of course produces a male gallery, from men down to lads not
yet pubescent--happy whistles and cheers for her beauty, nasty laughs at
yellow boy. First girls to take this duty were slot-machine types but
volunteers sprang up so fast that Prof decided we need not spend money.
He was correct: even Ludmilla, shy as a kitten, wanted to try it and did
not only because Mum told her not to. But Lenore, ten years older and

prettiest of our family, did try it and Mum did not scold. She came back
pink and excited and pleased with herself and anxious to tease enemy
again. Her own idea; Lenore did not then know that revolution was
brewing.
During this time I rarely saw Prof and never in public; we kept
touch by phone. At first a bottleneck was that our farm had just one
phone for twenty-five people, many of them youngsters who would tie up a
phone for hours unless coerced. Mimi was strict; our kids were allowed
one out-going call per day and max of ninety seconds on a call, with
rising scale of punishment--tempered by her warmth in granting
exceptions. But grants were accompanied by "Mum's Phone Lecture": "When I
first came to Luna there were no private phones. You children don't know
how soft..."
We were one of last prosperous families to install a phone; it was
new in household when I was opted. We were prosperous because we never
bought anything farm could produce. Mum disliked phone because rates to
Luna City Co-op Comm Company were passed on in large measure to
Authority. She never could understand why I could not ("Since you know
all about such things, Manuel dear") steal phone service as easily as we
liberated power. That a phone instrument was part of a switching system
into which it must fit was no interest to her.
Steal it I did, eventually. Problem with illicit phone is how to
receive incoming calls. Since phone is not listed, even if you tell
persons from whom you want calls, switching system itself does not have
you listed; is no signal that can tell it to connect other party with
you.
Once Mike joined conspiracy, switching was no problem. I had in
workshop most of what I needed; bought some items and liberated others.
Drilled a tiny hole from workshop to phone cupboard and another to Wyoh's
room--virgin rock a meter thick but a laser drill collimated to a thin
pencil cuts rapidly. I unshipped listed phone, made a wireless coupling
to line in its recess and concealed it. All else needed were binaural
receptors and a speaker in Wyoh's room, concealed, and same in mine, and
a circuit to raise frequency above audio to have silence on Davis phone
line, and its converse to restore audio incoming.
Only problem was to do this without being seen, and Mum generaled
that.
All else was Mike's problem. Used no switching arrangements; from
then on used MYCROFTXXX only when calling from some other phone. Mike
listened at all times in workshop and in Wyoh's room; if he heard my
voice or hers say "Mike," he answered, but not to other voices. Voice
patterns were as distinctive to him as fingerprints; he never made
mistakes.
Minor flourishes--soundprooflng Wyoh's door such as workshop door
already had, switching to suppress my instrument or hers, signals to tell
me she was alone in her room and door locked, and vice versa. All added
up to safe means whereby Wyob and I could talk with Mike or with each
other, or could set up talk-talk of Mike, Wyoh, Prof, and self. Mike
would call Prof wherever he was; Prof would talk or call back from a more
private phone. Or might be Wyoh or myself had to be found. We all were
careful to stay checked in with Mike.
My bootleg phone, though it had no way to punch a call, could be
used to call any number in Luna--speak to Mike, ask for a Sherlock to

anybody--not tell him number, Mike had all listings and could look up a
number faster than I could.
We were beginning to see unlimited possibilities in a
phoneswitching system alive and on our side. I got from Mike and gave Mum
still another null number to call Mike if she needed to reach me. She
grew chummy with Mike while continuing to think he was a man. This spread
through our family. One day as I returned home Sidris said, "Mannie
darling, your friend with the nice voice called. Mike Holmes. Wants you
to call back."
"Thanks, hon. Will."
"When are you going to invite him to dinner, Man? I think he's
nice."
I told her Gospodin Holmes had bad breath, was covered with rank
hair, and hated women.
She used a rude word, Mum not being in earshot. "You're afraid to
let me see him. Afraid I'll opt out for him." I patted her and told her
that was why. I told Mike and Prof about it. Mike flirted even more with
my womenfolk after that; Prof was thoughtful.
I began to learn techniques of conspiracy and to appreciate Prof's
feeling that revolution could be an art. Did not forget (nor ever doubt)
Mike's prediction that Luna was only seven years from disaster. But did
not think about it, thought about fascinating, finicky details.
Prof had emphasized that stickiest problems in conspiracy are
communications and security, and had pointed out that they conflict-easier are communications, greater is risk to security; if security is
tight, organization can be paralyzed by safety precautions. He had
explained that cell system was a compromise.
I accepted cell system since was necessary to limit losses from
spies. Even Wyoh admitted that organization without compartmentation
could not work after she learned how rotten with spies old underground
had been.
But I did not like clogged communications of cell system; like
Terran dinosaurs of old, took too long to send message from head to tail,
or back.
So talked with Mike.
We discarded many-linked channels I had suggested to Prof. We
retained cells but based security and communication on marvelous
possibilities of our dinkum thinkum.
Communications: We set up a ternary tree of "party" names:
Chairman, Gospodin Adam Selene (Mike)
Executive cell: Bork (me), Betty (Wyoh), Bill (Prof)
Bork's cell: Cassie (Mum), Colin, Chang
Betty's cell: Calvin (Greg), Cecilia (Sidris), Clayton
Bill's cell: Cornwall (Finn Nielsen), Carolyn, Cotter
--and so on. At seventh link George supervises Herbert, Henry, and
Hallie. By time you reach that level you need 2, 187 names with "H"--but
turn it over to savvy computer who finds or invents them. Each recruit is
given a party name and an emergency phone number. This number, instead of
chasing through many links, connects with "Adam Selene," Mike.
Security: Based on double principle; no human being can be trusted
with anything--but Mike could be trusted with everything.
Grim first half is beyond dispute. With drugs and other unsavory
methods any man can be broken. Only defense is suicide, which may be

impossible. Oh, are "hollow tooth" methods, classic and novel, some
nearly infallible--Prof saw to it that Wyoh and myself were equipped.
Never knew what he gave her as a final friend and since I never had to
use mine, is no point in messy details. Nor am I sure I would ever
suicide; am not stuff of martyrs.
But Mike could never need to suicide, could not be drugged, did not
feel pain. He carried everything concerning us in a separate memory bank
under a locked signal programmed only to our three voices, and, since
flesh is weak, we added a signal under which any of us could lock out
other two in emergency. In my opinion as best computerman in Luna, Mike
could not remove this lock once it was set up. Best of all, nobody would
ask master computer for this file because nobody knew it existed, did not
suspect Mike-as-Mike existed. How secure can you be?
Only risk was that this awakened machine was whimsical. Mike was
always showing unforeseen potentials; conceivable he could figure way to
get around block--if he wanted to.
But would never want to. He was loyal to me, first and oldest
friend; he liked Prof; I think he loved Wyoh. No, no, sex meant nothing.
But Wyoh is lovable and they hit it off from start.
I trusted Mike. In this life you have to bet; on that bet I would
give any odds.
So we based security on trusting Mike with everything while each of
us knew only what he had to know. Take that tree of names and numbers. I
knew only party names of my cellmates and of three directly under me; was
all I needed. Mike set up party names, assigned phone number to each,
kept roster of real names versus party names. Let's say party member
"Daniel" (whom I would not know, being a "D" two levels below me)
recruits Fritz Schultz. Daniel reports fact but not name upwards; Adam
Selene calls Daniel, assigns for Schultz party name "Embrook," then
phones Schultz at number received from Daniel, gives Schultz his name
Embrook and emergency phone number, this number being different for each
recruit.
Not even Embrook's cell leader would know Embrook's emergency
number. What you do not know you cannot spill, not under drugs nor
torture, nor anything. Not even from carelessness.
Now let's suppose I need to reach Comrade Embrook. I don't know who
he is; he may live in Hong Kong or be shopkeeper nearest my home. Instead
of passing message down, hoping it will reach him, I call Mike. Mike
connects me with Embrook at once, in a Sherlock, without giving me his
number.
Or suppose I need to speak to comrade who is preparing cartoon we
are about to distribute in every taproom in Luna. I don't know who he is.
But I need to talk to him; something has come up.
I call Mike; Mike knows everything--and again I am quickly
connected--and this comrade knows it's okay as Adam Selene arranged call.
"Comrade Bork speaking"--and he doesn't know me but initial "B" tells him
that I am vip indeed--"we have to change so-and-so. Tell your cell leader
and have him check, but get on with it."
Minor flourishes--some comrades did not have phones; some could be
reached only at certain hours; some outlying warrens did not have phone
service. No matter, Mike knew everything--and rest of us did not know
anything that could endanger any but that handful whom each knew face to
face.

After we decided that Mike should talk voice-to-voice to any
comrade under some circumstances, it was necessary to give him more
voices and dress him up, make him three dimensions, create "Adam Selene,
Chairman of the Provisional Committee of Free Luna."
Mike's need for more voices lay in fact that he had just one vodervocoder, whereas his brain could handle a dozen conversations, or a
hundred (don't know how many)--like a chess master playing fifty
opponents, only more so.
This would cause a bottleneck as organization grew and Adam Selene
was phoned oftener, and could be crucial if we lasted long enough to go
into action.
Besides giving him more voices I wanted to silence one he had. One
of those so-called computermen might walk into machines room while we
were phoning Mike; bound to cause even his dim wit to wonder if he found
master machine apparently talking to itself.
Voder-vocoder is very old device. Human voice is buzzes and hisses
mixed various ways; true even of a coloratura soprano. A vocoder analyzes
buzzes and hisses into patterns, one a computer (or trained eye) can
read. A voder is a little box which can buzz and hiss and has controls to
vary these elements to match those patterns. A human can "play" a voder,
producing artificial speech; a properly programmed computer can do it as
fast, as easily, as clearly as you can speak.
But voices on a phone wire are not sound waves but electrical
signals; Mike did not need audio part of voder-vocoder to talk by phone.
Sound waves were needed only by human at other end; no need for speech
sounds inside Mike's room at Authority Complex. so I planned to remove
them, and thereby any danger that somebody might notice.
First I worked at home, using number-three arm most of time. Result
was very small box which sandwiched twenty voder-vocoder circuits minus
audio side. Then I called Mike and told him to "get ill" in way that
would annoy Warden. Then I waited.
We had done this "get ill" trick before. I went back to work once
we learned that I was clear, which was Thursday that same week when
Alvarez read into Zebra file an account of shambles at Stilyagi Hall. His
version listed about one hundred people (out of perhaps three hundred);
list included Shorty Mkrum, Wyoh, Prof, and Finn Nielsen but not me-apparently I was missed by his finks. It told how nine police officers,
each deputized by Warden to preserve peace, had been shot down in cold
blood. Also named three of our dead.
An add-on a week later stated that "the notorious agente
provocateuse Wyoming Knott of Hong Kong in Luna, whose incendiary speech
on Monday 13 May had incited the riot that cost the lives of nine brave
officers, had not been apprehended in Luna City and had not returned to
her usual haunts in Hong Kong in Luna, and was now believed to have died
in the massacre she herself set off. " This add-on admitted what earlier
report failed to mention, i. e., bodies were missing and exact number of
dead was not known.
This P. S. settled two things: Wyoh could not go home nor back to
being a blonde.
Since I had not been spotted I resumed my public ways, took care of
customers that week, bookkeeping machines and retrieval files at Carnegie
Library, and spent time having Mike read out Zebra file and other special
files, doing so in Room L of Raffles as I did not yet have my own phone.
During that week Mike niggled at me like an impatient child (which he

was), wanting to know when I was coming over to pick up more jokes.
Failing that, he wanted to tell them by phone.
I got annoyed and had to remind myself that from Mike's viewpoint
analyzing jokes was just as important as freeing Luna--and you don't
break promises to a child.
Besides that. I got itchy wondering whether I could go inside
Complex without being nabbed. We knew Prof was not clear, was sleeping in
Raffles on that account. Yet they knew he had been at meeting and knew
where he was, daily--but no attempt was made to pick him up. When we
learned that attempt had been made to pick up Wyoh, I grew itchier. Was I
clear? Or were they waiting to nab me quietly? Had to know.
So I called Mike and told him to have a tummyache. He did so, I was
called in--no trouble. Aside from showing passport at station, then to a
new guard at Complex, all was usual. I chatted with Mike, picked up one
thousand jokes (with understanding that we would report a hundred at a
time every three or four days, no faster), told him to get well, and went
back to L-City, stopping on way out to bill Chief Engineer for working
time, travel-and-tool time, materials, special service, anything I could
load in.
Thereafter saw Mike about once a month. Was safe, never went there
except when they called me for malfunction beyond ability of their staff-and I was always able to "repair" it, sometimes quickly, sometimes after
a full day and many tests. Was careful to leave tool marks on cover
plates, and had before-and-after print-outs of test runs to show what had
been wrong, how I analyzed it, what I had done. Mike always worked
perfectly after one of my visits; I was indispensable.
So, after I prepared his new voder-vocoder add-on, didn't hesitate
to tell him to get "ill." Call came in thirty minutes. Mike had thought
up a dandy; his "illness" was wild oscillations in conditioning Warden's
residence. He was running its heat up, then down, on an eleven-minute
cycle, while oscillating its air pressure on a short cycle, ca .2c/s,
enough to make a man dreadfully nervy and perhaps cause earache.
Conditioning a single residence should not go through a master
computer! In Davis Tunnels we handled home and farm with idiot controls,
feedbacks for each cubic with alarms so that somebody could climb out of
bed and control by hand until trouble could be found. If cows got chilly,
did not hurt corn; if lights failed over wheat, vegetables were okay.
That Mike could raise hell with Warden's residence and nobody could
figure out what to do shows silliness of piling everything into one
computer.
Mike was happy-joyed. This was humor he really scanned. I enjoyed
it, too, told him to go ahead, have fun--spread out tools, got out little
black box.
And computerman-of-the-watch comes banging and ringing at door. I
took my time answering and carried number-five arm in right hand with
short wing bare; this makes some people sick and upsets almost everybody.
"What in hell do you want, choom?" I inquired.
"Listen," he says, "Warden is raising hell! Haven't you found
trouble?"
"My compliments to Warden and tell him I will override by hand to
restore his precious comfort as soon as I locate faulty circuit--if not
slowed up by silly questions. Are you going to stand with door open
blowing dust into machines while I have cover plates off? If you do-since you're in charge--when dust puts machine on sputter, you can repair

it. I won't leave a warm bed to help. You can tell that to your bloody
Warden, too."
"Watch your language, cobber."
"Watch yours, convict. Are you going to close that door? Or shall I
walk out and go back to L-City?" And raised number-five like a club.
He closed door. Had no interest in insulting poor sod. Was one
small bit of policy to make everybody as unhappy as possible. He was
finding working for Warden difficult; I wanted to make it unbearable.
"Shall I step it up?" Mike inquired.
"Um, hold it so for ten minutes, then stop abruptly. Then jog it
for an hour, say with air pressure. Erratic but hard. Know what a sonic
boom is?"
"Certainly. It is a--"
"Don't define. After you drop major effect, rattle his air ducts
every few minutes with nearest to a boom system will produce. Then give
him something to remember. Mmm. . . Mike, can you make his W. C. run
backwards?"
"I surely can! All of them?"
"How many does he have?"
"Six."
"Well... program to give them all a push, enough to soak his rugs.
But if you can spot one nearest his bedroom, fountain it clear to
ceiling. Can?"
"Program set up!"
"Good. Now for your present, ducky." There was room in voder audio
box to hide it and I spent forty minutes with number-three, getting it
just so. We trial-checked through voder-vocoder, then I told him to call
Wyoh and check each circuit.
For ten minutes was silence, which I spent putting tool markers on
a cover plate which should have been removed had been anything wrong,
putting tools away, putting number-six arm on, rolling up one thousand
jokes waiting in print-out. I had found no need to cut out audio of
voder; Mike had thought of it before I had and always chopped off any
time door was touched. Since his reflexes were better than mine by a
factor of at least a thousand, I forgot it.
At last he said, "All twenty circuits okay. I can switch circuits
in the middle of a word and Wyoh can't detect discontinuity. And I called
Prof and said Hello and talked to Mum on your home phone, all three at
the same time."
"We're in business. What excuse you give Mum?"
"I asked her to have you call me, Adam Selene that is. Then we
chatted. She's a charming conversationalist. We discussed Greg's sermon
of last Tuesday."
"Huh? How?"
"I told her I had listened to it, Man, and quoted a poetic part."
"Oh, Mike!"
"It's okay, Man. I let her think that I sat in back, then slipped
out during the closing hymn. She's not nosy; she knows that I don't want
to be seen."
Mum is nosiest female in Luna. "Guess it's okay. But don't do it
again. Um--Do do it again. You go to--you monitor--meetings and lectures
and concerts and stuff."
"Unless some busybody switches me off by hand! Man, I can't control
those spot pickups the way I do a phone."

"Too simple a switch. Brute muscle rather than solid-state
flipflop."
"That's barbaric. And unfair."
"Mike, almost everything is unfair. What can't be cured--"
"--must be endured. That's a funny-once, Man."
"Sorry. Let's change it: What can't be cured should be tossed out
and something better put in. Which we'll do. What chances last time you
calculated?"
"Approximately one in nine, Man."
"Getting worse?"
"Man, they'll get worse for months. We haven't reached the crisis."
"With Yankees in cellar, too. Oh, well. Back to other matter. From
now on, when you talk to anyone, if he's been to a lecture or whatever,
you were there, too--and prove it, by recalling something."
"Noted. Why, Man?"
"Have you read 'The Scarlet Pimpernel'? May be in public library."
"Yes. Shall I read it back?"
"No, no! You're our Scarlet Pinipernel, our John Galt, our Swamp
Fox, our man of mystery. You go everywhere, know everything, slip in and
out of town without passport. You're always there, yet nobody catches
sight of you."
His lights rippled, he gave a subdued chuckle. "That's fun, Man.
Funny once, funny twice, maybe funny always."
"Funny always. How long ago did you stop gymkhana at Warden's?"
"Forty-three minutes ago except erratic booms."
"Bet his teeth ache! Give him fifteen minutes more. Then I'll
report job completed."
"Noted. Wyoh sent you a message, Man. She said to remind you of
Billy's birthday party."
"Oh, my word! Stop everything, I'm leaving. 'Bye!" I hurried out.
Billy's mother is Anna. Probably her last--and right well she's done by
us, eight kids, three still home. I try to be as careful as Mum never to
show favoritism... but Billy is quite a boy and I taught him to read.
Possible he looks like me.
Stopped at Chief Engineer's office to leave bill and demanded to
see him. Was let in and he was in belligerent mood; Warden had been
riding him. "Hold it," I told him. "My son's birthday and shan't be late.
But must show you something."
Took an envelope from kit, dumped item on desk: corpse of house fly
which I had charred with a hot wire and fetched. We do not tolerate flies
in Davis Tunnels but sometimes one wanders in from city as locks are
opened. This wound up in my workshop just when I needed it. "See that?
Guess where I found it."
On that faked evidence I built a lecture on care of fine machines,
talked about doors opened, complained about man on watch. "Dust can ruin
a computer. Insects are unpardonable! Yet your watchstanders wander in
and out as if tube station. Today both doors held open--while this idiot
yammered. If I find more evidence that cover plates have been removed by
hoof-handed choom who attracts flies--well, it's your plant, Chief. Got
more than I can handle, been doing your chores because I like fine
machines. Can't stand to see them abused! Good-bye."
"Hold on. I want to tell you something."
"Sorry, got to go. Take it or leave it, I'm no vermin exterminator;
I'm a computerman."

Nothing frustrates a man so much as not letting him get in his say.
With luck and help from Warden, Chief Engineer would have ulcers by
Christmas.
Was late anyhow and made humble apology to Billy. Alvarez had
thought up new wrinkle, close search on leaving Complex. I endured it
with never a nasty word for Dragoons who searched me; wanted to get home.
But those thousand jokes bothered them. "What's this?" one demanded.
"Computer paper," I said. "Test runs."
His mate joined him. Don't think they could read. They wanted to
confiscate, so I demanded they call Chief Engineer. They let me go. I
felt not displeased; more and more such and guards were daily more hated.
Decision to make Mike more a person arose from need to have any
Party member phone him on occasion; my advice about concerts and plays
was simply a side effect. Mike's voice over phone had odd quality I had
not noticed during time I had visited him only at Complex. When you speak
to a man by phone there is background noise. And you hear him breathe,
hear heartbeats, body motions even though rarely conscious of these.
Besides that, even if he speaks under a hush hood, noises get through,
enough to "fill space," make him a body with surroundings.
With Mike was none of this.
By then Mike's voice was "human" in timbre and quality,
recognizable. He was baritone, had North American accent with Aussie
overtones; as "Michelle" he (she?) had a light soprano with French
flavor. Mike's personality grew also. When first I introduced him to Wyoh
and Prof he sounded like a pedantic child; in short weeks he flowered
until I visualized a man about own age.
His voice when he first woke was blurred and harsh, hardly
understandable. Now it was clear and choice of words and phrasing was
consistent--colloquial to me, scholarly to Prof, gallant to Wyoh,
variation one expects of mature adults.
But background was dead. Thick silence.
So we filled it. Mike needed only hints. He did not make his
breathing noisy, ordinarily you would not notice. But he would stick in
touches. "Sorry, Mannie, you caught me bathing when the phone sounded"-and let one hear hurried breathing. Or "I was eating--had to swallow." He
used such even on me, once he undertook to "be a human body."
We all put "Adam Selene" together, talking it over at Raffles. How
old was he? What did he look like? Married? Where did he live? What work?
What interests?
We decided that Adam was about forty, healthy, vigorous, well
educated, interested in all arts and sciences and very well grounded in
history, a match chess player but- little time to play. He was married in
commonest type, a troika in which he was senior husband--four children.
Wife and junior husband not in politics, so far as we knew.
He was ruggedly handsome with wavy iron-gray hair and was mixed
race, second generation one side, third on other. Was wealthy by Loonie
standards, with interests in Novylen and Kongville as well as L-City. He
kept offices in Luna City, outer office with a dozen people plus private
office staffed by male deputy and female secretary.
Wyoh wanted to know was he bundling with secretary? I told her to
switch off, was private. Wyoh said indignantly that she was not being
snoopy--weren't we trying to create a rounded character?
We decided that offices were in Old Dome, third ramp, southside,
heart of financial district. If you know L-City. you recall that in Old

Dome some offices have windows since they can look out over floor of
Dome; I wanted this for sound effects.
We drew a floor plan and had that office existed, it would have
been between Aetna Luna and Greenberg & Co. I used pouch recorder to pick
up sounds at spot; Mike added to it by listening at phones there.
Thereafter when you called Adam Selene, background was not dead. If
"Ursula," his secretary, took call, it was: "Selene Associates. Luna
shall be free!" Then she might say, "Will you hold? Gospodin Selene is on
another call" whereupon you might hear sound of W. C., followed by
running water and know that she had told little white lie. Or Adam might
answer: "Adam Selene here. Free Luna. One second while I shut off the
video." Or deputy might answer: "This is Albert Ginwallah, Adam Selene's
confidential assistant. Free Luna. If it's a Party matter--as I assume it
is; that was your Party name you gave--please don't hesitate; I handle
such things for the Chairman."
Last was a trap, as every comrade was instructed to speak only to
Adam Selene. No attempt was made to discipline one who took bait; instead
his cell captain was warned that his comrade must not be trusted with
anything vital.
We got echoes. "Free Luna!" or "Luna shall be free!" took hold
among youngsters, then among solid citizens. First time I heard it in a
business call I almost swallowed teeth. Then called Mike and asked if
this person was Party member? Was not. So I recommended that Mike trace
down Party tree and see if somebody could recruit him.
Most interesting echo was in File Zebra. "Adam Selene" appeared in
boss fink's security file less than a lunar after we created him, with
notation that this was a cover name for a leader in a new underground.
Alvarez's spies did a job on Adam Selene. Over course of months his
File Zebra dossier built up: Male, 34-45, offices south face of Old Dome,
usually there 0900-1800 Gr. except Saturday but calls are relayed at
other hours, home inside urban pressure as travel time never exceeds
seventeen minutes. Children in household. Activities include stock
brokerage, farming interests. Attends theater, concerts, etc. Probably
member Luna City Chess Club and Luna Assoc, d'Echecs. Plays ricochet and
other heavy sports lunch hour, probably Luna City Athletic Club. Gourmet
but watches weight. Remarkable memory plus mathematical ability.
Executive type, able to reach decisions quickly.
One fink was convinced that he had talked to Adam between acts at
revival of Hamlet by Civic Players; Alvarez noted description--and
matched our picture all but wavy hair!
But thing that drove Alvarez crackers was that phone numbers for
Adam were reported and every time they turned out wrong numbers. (Not
nulls; we had run out and Mike was using any number not in use and
switching numbers anytime new subscribers were assigned ones we had been
using.) Alvarez tried to trace "Selene Associates" using a one-wrongdigit assumption--this we learned because Mike was keeping an ear on
Alvarez's office phone and heard order. Mike used knowledge to play a
Mikish prank: Subordinate who made one-changed-digit calls invariably
reached Warden's private residence. So Alvarez was called in and chewed
by Warden.
Couldn't scold Mike but did warn him it would alert any smart
person to fact that somebody was playing tricks with computer. Mike
answered that they were not that smart.

Main result of Alvarez's efforts was that each time he got a number
for Adam we located a spy--a new spy, as those we had spotted earlier
were never given phone numbers; instead they were recruited into a tailchasing organization where they could inform on each other. But with
Alvarez's help we spotted each new spy almost at once. I think Alvarez
became unhappy over spies he was able to hire; two disappeared and our
organization, then over six thousand, was never able to find them.
Eliminated, I suppose, or died under questioning.
Selene Associates was not only phony company we set up. LuNoHoCo
was much larger, just as phony, and not at all dummy; it had main offices
in Hong Kong, branches in Novy Leningrad and Luna City, eventually
employed hundreds of people most of whom were not Party members, and was
our most difficult operation.
Mike's master plan listed a weary number of problems which had to
be solved. One was finance. Another was how to protect catapult from
space attack.
Prof considered robbing banks to solve first, gave it up
reluctantly. But eventually we did rob banks, firms, and Authority
itself. Mike thought of it. Mike and Prof worked it out. At first was not
clear to Mike why we needed money. He knew as little about pressure that
keeps humans scratching as he knew about sex; Mike handled millions of
dollars and could not see any problem. He started by offering to issue an
Authority cheque for whatever dollars we wanted.
Prof shied in horror. He then explained to Mike hazard in trying to
cash a cheque for, let us say, AS$l0, 000, 000 drawn on Authority.
So they undertook to do it, but retail, in many names and places
all over Luna. Every bank, firm, shop, agency including Authority, for
which Mike did accounting, was tapped for Party funds. Was a pyramided
swindle based on fact, unknown to me but known to Prof and latent in
Mike's immense knowledge, that most money is simply bookkeeping.
Example--multiply by hundreds of many types: My family son Sergei,
eighteen and a Party member, is asked to start account at Commonwealth
Shared Risk. He makes deposits and withdrawals. Small errors are made
each time; he is credited with more than he deposits, is debited with
less than he withdraws. A few months later he takes job out of town and
transfers account to Tycho-Under Mutual; transferred funds are three
times already-inflated amount. Most of this he soon draws out in cash and
passes to his cell leader. Mike knows amount Sergei should hand over, but
(since they do not know that Adam Selene and bank's computer-bookeeper
are one and same) they have each been instructed to report transaction to
Adam--keep them honest though scheme was not.
Multiply this theft of about HK$3, 000 by hundreds somewhat like
it.
I can't describe jiggery-pokery Mike used to balance his books
while keeping thousands of thefts from showing. But bear in mind that an
auditor must assume that machines are honest. He will make test runs to
check that machines are working correctly--but will not occur to him that
tests prove nothing because machine itself is dishonest. Mike's thefts
were never large enough to disturb economy; like half-liter of blood,
amount was too small to hurt donor. I can't make up mind who lost, money
was swapped around so many ways. But scheme troubled me; I was brought up
to be honest, except with Authority. Prof claimed that what was taking
place was a mild inflation offset by fact that we plowed money back in-but I should remember that Mike had records and all could be restored

after Revolution, with ease since we would no longer be bled in much
larger amounts by Authority.
I told conscience to go to sleep. Was pipsqueak compared to
swindles by every government throughout history in financing every war-and is not revolution a war?
This money, after passing through many hands (augmented by Mike
each time), wound up as senior financing of LuNoHo Company. Was a mixed
company, mutual and stock; "gentleman-adventurer" guarantors who backed
stock put up that stolen money in own names. Won't discuss bookkeeping
this firm used. Since Mike ran everything, was not corrupted by any tinge
of honesty.
Nevertheless its shares were traded in Hong Kong Luna Exchange and
listed in Zurich, London, and New York. Wall Street Journal called it "an
attractive high-risk-high-gain investment with novel growth potential."
LuNoHoCo was an engineering and exploitation firm, engaged in many
ventures, mostly legitimate. But prime purpose was to build a second
catapult, secretly.
Operation could not be secret. You can't buy or build a hydrogenfusion power plant for such and not have it noticed. (Sunpower was
rejected for obvious reasons.) Parts were ordered from Pittsburgh,
standard UnivCalif equipment, and we happily paid their royalties to get
top quality. Can't build a stator for a kilometers-long induction field
without having it noticed, either. But most important you cannot do major
construction hiring many people and not have it show. Sure, catapults are
mostly vacuum; stator rings aren't even close together at ejection end.
But Authority's 3-g catapult was almost one hundred kilometers long. It
was not only an astrogation landmark, on every Luna-jump chart, but was
so big it could be photographed or seen by eye from Terra with not-large
telescope. It showed up beautifully on a radar screen.
We were building a shorter catapult, a 10-g job, but even that was
thirty kilometers long, too big to hide.
So we hid it by Purloined Letter method.
I used to question Mike's endless reading of fiction, wondering
what notions he was getting. But turned out he got a better feeling for
human life from stories than he had been able to garner from facts;
fiction gave him a gestalt of life, one taken for granted by a human; he
lives it. Besides this "humanizing" effect, Mike's substitute for
experience, he got ideas from "not-true data" as he called fiction. How
to hide a catapult he got from Edgar Allan Poe.
We hid it in literal sense, too; this catapult had to be
underground, so that it would not show to eye or radar. But had to be
hidden in more subtle sense; selenographic location had to be secret.
How can this be, with a monster that big, worked on by so many
people? Put it this way: Suppose you live in Novylen; know where Luna
City is? Why, on east edge of Mare Crisium; everybody knows that. So?
What latitude and longitude? Huh? Look it up in a reference book! So? If
you don't know where any better than that, how did you find it last week?
No huhu, cobber; I took tube, changed at Torricelli, slept rest of way;
finding it was capsule's worry.
See? You don't know where Luna City is! You simply get out when
capsule pulls in at Tube Station South.
That's how we hid catapult.
Is in Mare Undarum area, "everybody knows that." But where it is
and where we said it was differ by amount greater or less than one

hundred kilometers in direction north, south, east, or west, or some
combination.
Today you can look up its location in reference books--and find
same wrong answer. Location of that catapult is still most closely
guarded secret in Luna.
Can't be seen from space, by eye or radar. Is underground save for
ejection and that is a big black shapeless hole like ten thousand others
and high up an uninviting mountain with no place for a jump rocket to put
down.
Nevertheless many people were there, during and after construction.
Even Warden visited and my co-husband Greg showed him around. Warden went
by mail rocket, commandeered for day, and his Cyborg was given
coordinates and a radar beacon to home on--a spot in fact not far from
site. But from there, it was necessary to travel by rolligon and our
lorries were not like passenger buses from Endsville to Beluthihatchie in
old days; they were cargo carriers, no ports for sightseeing and a ride
so rough that human cargo had to be strapped down. Warden wanted to ride
up in cab but--sorry, Gospodin!--just space for wrangler and his helper
and took both to keep her steady.
Three hours later he did not care about anything but getting home.
He stayed one hour and was not interested in talk about purpose of all
this drilling and value of resources uncovered.
Less important people, workmen and others, traveled by
interconnecting ice-exploration bores, still easier way to get lost. If
anybody carried an inertial pathfinder in his luggage, he could have
located site--but security was tight. One did so and had accident with psuit; his effects were returned to L-City and his pathfinder read what it
should--i. e., what we wanted it to read, for I made hurried trip out
with number-three arm along. You can reseal one without a trace if you do
it in nitrogen atmosphere--I wore an oxygen mask at slight overpressure.
No huhu.
We entertained vips from Earth, some high in Authority. They
traveled easier underground route; I suppose Warden had warned them. But
even on that route is one thirty-kilometer stretch by rolligon. We had
one visitor from Earth who looked like trouble, a Dr. Dorian, physicist
and engineer. Lorry tipped over--silly driver tried shortcut--they were
not in line-of-sight for anything and their beacon was smashed. Poor Dr.
Dorian spent seventy-two hours in an unsealed pumice igloo and had to be
returned to L-City ill from hypoxia and overdose of radiation despite
efforts on his behalf by two Party members driving him.
Might have been safe to let him see; he might not have spotted
doubletalk and would not have spotted error in location. Few people look
at stars when p-suited even when Sun doesn't make it futile; still fewer
can read stars--and nobody can locate himself on surface without help
unless he has instruments, knows how to use them and has tables and
something to give a time tick. Put at crudest level, minimum would be
octant, tables, and good watch. Our visitors were even encouraged to go
out on surface but if one had carried an octant or modern equivalent,
might have had accident.
We did not make accidents for spies. We let them stay, worked them
hard, and Mike read their reports. One reported that he was certain that
we had found uranium ore, something unknown in Luna at that time. Project
Centerbore being many years later. Next spy came out with kit of
radiation counters. We made it easy for him to sneak them through bore.

By March '76 catapult was almost ready, lacking only installation
of stator segments. Power plant was in and a co-ax had been strung
underground with a line-of-sight link for that thirty kilometers. Crew
was down to skeleton size, mostly Party members. But we kept one spy so
that Alvarez could have regular reports--didn't want him to worry; it
tended to make him suspicious. Instead we worried him in warrens.

10
Were changes in those eleven months. Wyoh was baptized into Greg's
church, Prof's health became so shaky that he dropped teaching, Mike took
up writing poetry. Yankees finished in cellar. Wouldn't have minded
paying Prof if they had been nosed out, but from pennant to cellar in one
season--I quit watching them on video.
Prof's illness was phony. He was in perfect shape for age,
exercising in hotel room three hours each day, and sleeping in three
hundred kilograms of lead pajamas. And so was I, and so was Wyoh, who
hated it. I don't think she ever cheated and spent night in comfort
though can't say for sure; I was not dossing with her. She had become a
fixture in Davis family. Took her one day to go from "Gospazha Davis" to
"Gospazha Mum," one more to reach "Mum" and now it might be "Mimi Mum"
with arm around Mum's waist. When Zebra File showed she couldn't go back
to Hong Kong, Sidris had taken Wyoh into her beauty shop after hours and
done a job which left skin same dark shade but would not scrub off.
Sidris also did a hairdo on Wyoh that left it black and looking as if
unsuccessfully unkinked. Plus minor touches--opaque nail enamel, plastic
inserts for cheeks and nostrils and of course she wore her dark-eyed
contact lenses. When Sidris got through, Wyoh could have gone bundling
without fretting about her disguise; was a perfect "colored" with
ancestry to match--Tamil, a touch of Angola, German. I called her "Wyma"
rather than "Wyoh."
She was gorgeous. When she undulated down a corridor, boys followed
in swarms.
She started to learn farming from Greg but Mum put stop to that.
While she was big and smart and willing, our farm is mostly a male
operation--and Greg and Hans were not only male members of our family
distracted; she cost more farming man-hours than her industry equaled. So
Wyoh went back to housework, then Sidris took her into beauty shop as
helper.
Prof played ponies with two accounts, betting one by Mike's
"leading apprentice" system, other by his own "scientific" system. By
July '75 he admitted that he knew nothing about horses and went solely to
Mike's system, increasing bets and spreading them among many bookies. His
winnings paid Party's expenses while Mike built swindle that financed
catapult. But Prof lost interest in a sure thing and merely placed bets
as Mike designated. He stopped reading pony journals--sad, something dies
when an old horseplayer quits.
Ludmilla had a girl which they say is lucky in a first and which
delighted me--every family needs a girl baby. Wyoh surprised our women by

being expert in midwifery--and surprised them again that she knew nothing
about baby care. Our two oldest sons found marriages at last and Teddy,
thirteen, was opted out. Greg hired two lads from neighbor farms and,
after six months of working and eating with us, both were opted in--not
rushing things, we had known them and their families for years. It
restored balance we had lacked since Ludmilla's opting and put stop to
snide remarks from mothers of bachelors who had not found marriages---not
that Mum wasn't capable of snubbing anyone she did not consider up to
Davis standards.
Wyoh recruited Sidris; Sidris started own cell by recruiting her
other assistant and Bon Ton Beaute Shoppe became hotbed of subversion. We
started using our smallest kids for deliveries and other jobs a child can
do--they can stake out or trail a person through corridors better than an
adult, and are not suspected. Sidris grabbed this notion and expanded it
through women recruited in beauty parlor.
Soon she had so many kids on tap that we could keep all of
Alvarez's spies under surveillance. With Mike able to listen at any phone
and a child spotting it whenever a spy left home or place of work or
wherever--with enough kids on call so that one could phone while another
held down a new stakeout--we could keep a spy under tight observation and
keep him from seeing anything we didn't want him to see. Shortly we were
getting reports spies phoned in without waiting for Zebra File; it did a
sod no good to phone from a taproom instead of home; with Baker Street
Irregulars on job Mike was listening before he finished punching number.
These kids located Alvarez's deputy spy boss in L-City. We knew he
had one because these finks did not report to Alvarez by phone, nor did
it seem possible that Alvarez could have recruited them as none of them
worked in Complex and Alvarez came inside Luna City only when an
Earthside vip was so important as to rate a bodyguard commanded by
Alvarez in person.
His deputy turned out to be two people--an old lag who ran a candy,
news, and bookie counter in Old Dome and his son who was on civil service
in Complex. Son carried reports in, so Mike had not been able to hear
them.
We let them alone. But from then on we had fink field reports half
a day sooner than Alvarez. This advantage--all due to kids as young as
five or six--saved lives of seven comrades. All glory to Baker Street
Irregulars!
Don't remember who named them but think it was Mike--I was merely a
Sherlock Homes fan whereas he really did think he was Sherlock Holmes's
brother Mycroft... nor would I swear he was not; "reality" is a slippery
notion. Kids did not call themselves that; they had their own play gangs
with own names. Nor were they burdened with secrets which could endanger
them; Sidris left it to mothers to explain why they were being asked to
do these jobs save that they were never to be told real reason. Kids will
do anything mysterious and fun; look how many of their games are based on
outsmarting.
Bon Ton salon was a clearinghouse of gossip--women get news faster
than Daily Lunatic. I encouraged Wyoh to report to Mike each night, not
try to thin gossip down to what seemed significant because was no telling
what might be significant once Mike got through associating it with a
million other facts.
Beauty parlor was also place to start rumors. Party had grown
slowly at first, then rapidly as powers-of-three began to be felt and

also because Peace Dragoons were nastier than older bodyguard. As numbers
increased we shifted to high speed on agitprop, black-propaganda rumors,
open subversion, provocateur activities, and sabotage. Finn Nielsen
handled agitprop when it was simpler as well as dangerous job of
continuing to front for and put cover-up activity into older, spyridden
underground. But now a large chunk of agitprop and related work was given
to Sidris.
Much involved distributing handbills and such. No subversive
literature was ever in her shop, nor our home, nor that hotel room;
distribution was done by kids, too young to read.
Sidris was also working a full day bending hair and such. About
time she began to have too much to do I happened one evening to make
walk-about on Causeway with Sidris on my arm when I caught sight of a
familiar face and figure--skinny little girl, all angles, carrot-red
hair. She was possibly twelve, at stage when a fem shoots up just before
blossoming out into rounded softness. I knew her but could not say why or
when or where.
I said, "Psst, doll baby. Eyeball young fem ahead. Orange hair, no
cushions."
Sidris looked her over. "Darling, I knew you were eccentric. But
she's still a boy."
"Damp it. Who?"
"Bog knows. Shall I sprag her?"
Suddenly I remembered like video coming on. And wished Wyoh were
with me-but Wyoh and I were never together in public. This skinny redhead
had been at meeting where Shorty was killed. She sat on floor against
wall down front and listened with wide-eyed seriousness and applauded
fiercely. Then I had seen her at end in free trajectory--curled into ball
in air and had hit a yellow jacket in knees, he whose jaw I broke a
moment later.
Wyoh and I were alive and free because this kid moved fast in a
crisis. "No, don't speak to her," I told Sidris. "But I want to keep her
in sight. Wish we had one of your Irregulars here. Damn."
"Drop off and phone Wyoh, you'll have one in five minutes," my wife
said.
I did. Then Sidris and I strolled, looking in shopwindows and
moving slowly, as quarry was window-shopping. In seven or eight minutes a
small boy came toward us, stopped and said, "Hello, Auntie Mabell. Hi,
Uncle Joe."
Sidris took his hand. "Hi, Tony. How's your mother, dear?"
"Just fine." He added in a whisper, "I'm Jock."
"Sorry." Sidris said quietly to me, "Stay on her," and took Jock
into a tuck shop.
She came out and joined me. Jock followed her licking a lollipop.
"'Bye, Auntie Mabel! Thanks!" He danced away, rotating, wound up by that
little redhead, stood and stared into a display, solemnly sucking his
sweet. Sidris and I went home.
A report was waiting. "She went into Cradle Roll Creche and hasn't
come out. Do we stay on it?"
"A bit yet," I told Wyoh, and asked if she remembered this kid. She
did, but had no idea who she might be. "You could ask Finn."
"Can do better." I called Mike.
Yes, Cradle Roll Creche had a phone and Mike would listen. Took him
twenty minutes to pick up enough to give analysis--many young voices and

at such ages almost sexless. But presently he told me, "Man, I hear three
voices that could match the age and physical type you described. However,
two answer to names which I assume to be masculine. The third answers
when anyone says 'Hazel'--which an older female voice does repeatedly.
She seems to be Hazel's boss."
"Mike, look at old organization file. Check Hazels."
"Four Hazels," he answered at once, "and here she is: Hazel Meade,
Young Comrades Auxiliary, address Cradle Roll Creche, born 25 December
2063, mass thirty-nine kilos, height--"
"That's our little jump jet! Thanks, Mike. Wyoh, call off stakeout. Good job!"
"Mike, call Donna and pass the word, that's a dear."
I left it to girls to recruit Hazel Meade and did not eyeball her
until Sidris moved her into our household two weeks later. But Wyoh
volunteered a report before then; policy was involved. Sidris had filled
her cell but wanted Hazel Meade. Besides this irregularity, Sidris was
doubtful about recruiting a child. Policy was adults only, sixteen and
up.
I took it to Adam Selene and executive cell. "As I see," I said,
"this cells-of-three system is to serve us, not bind us. See nothing
wrong in Comrade Cecilia having an extra. Nor any real danger to
security."
"I agree," said Prof. "But I suggest that the extra member not be
part of Cecilia's cell--she should not know the others, I mean, unless
the duties Cecilia gives her make it necessary. Nor do I think she should
recruit, at her age. The real question is her age."
"Agreed," said Wyoh. "I want to talk about this kid's age."
"Friends," Mike said diffidently (diffidently first time in weeks;
he was now that confident executive "Adam Selene" much more than lonely
machine)--"perhaps I should have told you, but I have already granted
similar variations. It did not seem to require discussion."
"It doesn't, Mike," Prof reassured him. "A chairman must use his
own judgment. What is our largest cell?"
"Five. it is a double cell, three and two."
"No harm done. Dear Wyoh, does Sidris propose to make this child a
full comrade? Let her know that we are committed to revolution... with
all the bloodshed, disorder, and possible disaster that entails?"
"That's exactly what she is requesting."
"But, dear lady, while we are staking our lives, we are old enough
to know it. For that, one should have an emotional grasp of death.
Children seldom are able to realize that death will come to them
personally. One might define adulthood as the age at which a person
learns that he must die... and accepts his sentence undismayed."
"Prof," I said, "I know some mighty tall children. Seven to two
some are in Party."
"No bet, cobber. It'll give odds that at least half of them don't
qualify--and we may find it out the hard way at the end of this our
folly."
"Prof," Wyoh insisted. "Mike, Mannie. Sidris is certain this child
is an adult. And I think so, too."
"Man?" asked Mike.
"Let's find way for Prof to meet her and form own opinion. I was
taken by her. Especially her go-to-hell fighting. Or would never have
started it."

We adjourned and I heard no more. Hazel showed up at dinner shortly
thereafter as Sidris' guest. She showed no sign of recognizing me, nor
did I admit that I had ever seen her--but learned long after that she had
recognized me, not just by left arm but because I had been hatted and
kissed by tall blonde from Hong Kong. Furthermore Hazel had seen through
Wyoming's disguise, recognized what Wyoh never did successfully disguise:
her voice.
But Hazel used lip glue. If she ever assumed I was in conspiracy
she never showed it.
Child's history explained her, far as background can explain steely
character. Transported with parents as a baby much as Wyoh had been, she
had lost father through accident while he was convict labor, which her
mother blamed on indifference of Authority to safety of penal colonists.
Her mother lasted till Hazel was five; what she died from Hazel did not
know; she was then living in creche where we found her. Nor did she know
why parents had been shipped--possibly for subversion if they were both
under sentence as Hazel thought. As may be, her mother left her a fierce
hatred of Authority and Warden.
Family that ran Cradle Roll let her stay; Hazel was pinning diapers
and washing dishes as soon as she could reach. She had taught herself to
read, and could print letters but could not write. Her knowledge of math
was only that ability to count money that children soak up through their
skins.
Was fuss over her leaving creche; owner and husbands claimed Hazel
owed several years' service. Hazel solved it by walking out, leaving her
clothes and fewer belongings behind. Mum was angry enough to want family
to start trouble which could wind up in "brawling" she despised. But I
told her privately that, as her cell leader, I did nor want our family in
public eye--and hauled out cash and told her Party would pay for clothes
for Hazel. Mum refused money, called off a family meeting, took Hazel
into town and was extravagant--for Mum--in re-outfitting her.
So we adopted Hazel. I understand that these days adopting a child
involves red tape; in those days it was as simple as adopting a kitten.
Was more fuss when Mum started to place Hazel in school, which
fitted neither what Sidris had in mind nor what Hazel had been led to
expect as a Party member and comrade. Again I butted in and Mum gave in
part way. Hazel was placed in a tutoring school close to Sidris' shop-that is, near easement lock thirteen; beauty parlor was by it (Sidris had
good business because close enough that our water was piped in, and used
without limit as return line took it back for salvage). Hazel studied
mornings and helped in afternoons, pinning on gowns, handing out towels,
giving rinses, learning trade--and whatever else Sidris wanted.
"Whatever else" was captain of Baker Street Irregulars.
Hazel had handled younger kids all her short life. They liked her;
she could wheedle them into anything; she understood what they said when
an adult would find it gibberish. She was a perfect bridge between Party
and most junior auxiliary. She could make a game of chores we assigned
and persuade them to play by rules she gave them, and never let them know
it was adult-serious----but child-serious, which is another matter.
For example: Let's say a little one, too young to read, is caught
with a stack of subversive literature--which happened more than once.
Here's how it would go, after Hazel indoctrinated a kid: ADULT:
"Baby, where did you get this?"

BAKER STREET IRREGULAR: "I'm not a baby, I'm a big boy!"
ADULT:
"Okay, big boy, where did you get this?"
B.S.I.:
"Jackie give it to me."
ADULT:
"Who is Jackie?"
B.S.I.:
"Jackie."
ADULT:
"But what's his last name?"
B.S.I.:
"Who?"
ADULT:
"Jackie."
B.S.I.:
(scornfully) "Jackie's a girl!"
ADULT:
"All right, where does she live?"
B.S.I:
"Who?"
And so on around--To all questions key answer was of pattern:
"Jackie give it to me." Since Jackie didn't exist, he (she) didn't have a
last name, a home address, nor fixed sex. Those children enjoyed making
fools of adults, once they learned how easy it was.
At worst, literature was confiscated. Even a squad of Peace
Dragoons thought twice before trying to "arrest" a small child. Yes, we
were beginning to have squads of Dragoons inside Luna city, but never
less than a squad--some had gone in singly and not come back.
When Mike started writing poetry I didn't know whether to laugh or
cry. He wanted to publish it! Shows how thoroughly humanity had corrupted
this innocent machine that he should wish to see his name in print.
I said, "Mike, for Bog's sake! Blown all circuits? Or planning to
give us away?"
Before he could sulk Prof said, "Hold on, Manuel; I see
possibilities. Mike, would it suit you to take a pen name?"
That's how "Simon Jester" was born. Mike picked it apparently by
tossing random numbers. But he used another name for serious verse, his
Party name, Adam Selene.
"Simon's" verse was doggerel, bawdy, subversive, ranging from
poking fun at vips to savage attacks on Warden, system, Peace Dragoons,
finks. You found it on walls of public W. C. s, or on scraps of paper
left in tube capsules: Or in taprooms. Wherever they were they were
signed "Simon Jester" and with a matchstick drawing of a little horned
devil with big grin and forked tail. Sometimes he was stabbing a fat man
with a pitchfork. Sometimes just his face would appear, big grin and
horns, until shortly even horns and grin meant "Simon was here."
Simon appeared all over Luna same day and from then on never let
up. Shortly he started receiving volunteer help; his verses and little
pictures, so simple anybody could draw them, began appearing more places
than we had planned. This wider coverage had to be from fellow travelers.
Verses and cartoons started appearing inside Complex--which could not
have been our work; we never recruited civil servants. Also, three days
after initial appearance of a very rough limerick, one that implied that
Warden's fatness derived from unsavory habits, this limerick popped up on
pressure-sticky labels with cartoon improved so that fat victim flinching
from Simon's pitchfork was recognizably Mort the Wart. We didn't buy
them, we didn't print them. But they appeared in L-City and Novylen and
Hong Kong, stuck almost everywhere--public phones, stanchions in
corridors, pressure locks, ramp railings, other. I had a sample count
made, fed it to Mike; he reported that over seventy thousand labels had
been used in L-City alone.

I did not know of a printing plant in L-City willing to risk such a
job and equipped for it. Began to wonder if might be another
revolutionary cabal?
Simon's verses were such a success that he branched out as a
poltergeist and neither Warden nor security chief was allowed to miss it.
"Dear Mort the Wart," ran one letter. "Do please be careful from midnight
to four hundred tomorrow. Love & Kisses, Simon"--with horns and grin. In
same mail Alvarez received one reading: "Dear Pimplehead, If the Warden
breaks his leg tomorrow night it will be your fault. Faithfully your
conscience, Simon"--again with horns and smile.
We didn't have anything planned; we just wanted Mort and Alvarez to
lose sleep--which they did, plus bodyguard. All Mike did was to call
Warden's private phone at intervals from midnight to four hundred--an
unlisted number supposedly known only to his personal staff. By calling
members of his personal staff simultaneously and connecting them to Mort
Mike not only created confusion but got Warden angry at his assistants-he flatly refused to believe their denials.
But was luck that Warden, goaded too far, ran down a ramp. Even a
new chum does that only once. So he walked on air and sprained an ankle-close enough to a broken leg and Alvarez was there when it happened.
Those sleep-losers were mostly just that. Like rumor that Authority
catapult had been mined and would be blown up, another night. Ninety plus
eighteen men can't search a hundred kilometers of catapult in hours,
especially when ninety are Peace Dragoons not used to p-suit work and
hating it--this midnight came at new earth with Sun high; they were
outside far longer than is healthy, managed to cook up their own
accidents while almost cooking themselves, and showed nearest thing to
mutiny in regiment's history. One accident was fatal. Did he fall or was
he pushed? A sergeant.
Midnight alarms made Peace Dragoons on passport watch much taken by
yawning and more bad-tempered, which produced more clashes with Loonies
and still greater resentment both ways--so Simon increased pressure.
Adam Selene's verse was on a higher plane. Mike submitted it to
Prof and accepted his literary judgment (good, I think) without
resentment. Mike's scansion and rhyming were perfect, Mike being a
computer with whole English language in his memory and able to search for
a fitting word in microseconds. What was weak was self-criticism. That
improved rapidly under Prof's stern editorship.
Adam Selene's by-line appeared first in dignified pages of Moonglow
over a somber poem titled: "Home." Was dying thoughts of old transportee,
his discovery as he is about to leave that Luna is his beloved home.
Language was simple, rhyme scheme unforced, only thing faintly subversive
was conclusion on part of dying man that even many wardens he has endured
was not too high a price.
Doubt if Moonglow's editors thought twice. Was good stuff, they
published.
Alvarez turned editorial office inside out trying to get a line
back to Adam Selene. Issue had been on sale half a lunar before Alvarez
noticed it, or had it called to his attention; we were fretted, we wanted
that by-line noticed. We were much pleased with way Alvarez oscillated
when he did see it.
Editors were unable to help fink boss. They told him truth: Poem
had come in by mail. Did they have it? Yes, surely... sorry, no envelope;

they were never saved. After a long time Alvarez left, flanked by four
Dragoons he had fetched along for his health.
Hope he enjoyed studying that sheet of paper. Was piece of Adam
Selene's business stationery:
SELENE ASSOCIATES
LUNA CITY Investments
Office of the
Chairman
Old Dome --and under that was
typed Home, by Adam Selene, etc.
Any fingerprints were added after it left us. Had been typed on
Underwood Office Electrostator, commonest model in Luna. Even so, were
not too many as are importado; a scientific detective could have
identified machine. Would have found it in Luna City office of Lunar
Authority. Machines, should say, as we found six of model in office and
used them in rotation, five words and move to next. Cost Wyoh and self
sleep and too much risk even though Mike listened at every phone, ready
to warn. Never did it that way again.
Alvarez was not a scientific detective.

In early '76 I had too much to do. Could not neglect customers. Party
work took more time even though all possible was delegated. But decisions
had to be made on endless things and messages passed up and down. Had to
squeeze in hours of heavy exercise, wearing weights, and dasn't arrange
permission to use centrifuge at Complex, one used by earthworm scientists
to stretch time in Luna--while had used it before, this time could not
advertise that I was getting in shape for Earthside.
Exercising without centrifuge is less efficient and was especially
boring because did not know there would be need for it. But according to
Mike 30 percent of ways events could fall required some Loonie, able to
speak for Party, to make trip to Terra.
Could not see myself as an ambassador, don't have education and not
diplomatic. Prof was obvious choice of those recruited or likely to be.
But Prof was old, might not live to land Earthside. Mike told us that a
man of Prof's age, body type, etc., had less than 40 percent chance of
reaching Terra alive.
But Prof did gaily undertake strenuous training to let him make
most of his poor chances, so what could I do but put on weights and get
to work, ready to go and take his place if old heart clicked off? Wyoh
did same, on assumption that something might keep me from going. She did
it to share misery; Wyoh always used gallantry in place of logic.
On top of business, Party work, and exercise was farming. We had
lost three sons by marriage while gaining two fine lads, Frank and Ali.
Then Greg went to work for LuNoHoCo, as boss drillman on new catapult.
Was needful. Much skull sweat went into hiring construction crew.
We could use non-Party men for most jobs, but key spots had to be Party
men as competent as they were politically reliable. Greg did not want to
go; our farm needed him and he did not like to leave his congregation.
But accepted.

That made me again a valet, part time, to pigs and chickens. Hans
is a good farmer, picked up load and worked enough for two men. But Greg
had been farm manager ever since Grandpaw retired, new responsibility
worried Hans. Should have been mine, being senior, but Hans was better
farmer and closer to it; always been expected he would succeed Greg
someday. So I backed him up by agreeing with his opinions and tried to be
half a farm hand in hours I could squeeze. Left no time to scratch.
Late in February I was returning from long trip, Novylen, Tycho
Under, Churchill. New tube had just been completed across Sinus Medii, so
I went on to Hong Kong in Luna--business and did make contacts now that I
could promise emergency service. Fact that Endsville-Beluthihatchie bus
ran only during dark semi-lunar had made impossible before.
But business was cover for politics; liaison with Hong Kong had
been thin. Wyoh had done well by phone; second member of her cell was an
old comrade.--"Comrade Clayton"--who not only had clean bill of health in
Alverez's File Zebra but also stood high in Wyoh's estimation. Clayton
was briefed on policies, warned of bad apples, encouraged to start cell
system while leaving old organization untouched. Wyoh told him to keep
his membership, as before.
But phone isn't face-to-face. Hong Kong should have been our
stronghold. Was less tied to Authority as its utilities were not
controlled from Complex; was less dependent because lack (until recently)
of tube transport had made selling at catapult head less inviting; was
stronger financially as Bank of Hong Kong Luna notes were better money
than official Authority scrip.
I suppose Hong Kong dollars weren't "money" in some legal sense.
Authority would not accept them; times I went Earthside had to buy
Authority scrip to pay for ticket. But what I carried was Hong Kong
dollars as could be traded Earthside at a small discount whereas scrip
was nearly worthless there. Money or not, Hong Kong Bank notes were
backed by honest Chinee bankers instead of being fiat of bureaucracy. One
hundred Hong Kong dollars was 31 .1 grams of gold (old troy ounce)
payable on demand at home office--and they did keep gold there, fetched
up from Australia. Or you could demand commodities: non-potable water,
steel of defined grade, heavy water of power plant specs, other things.
Could buy these with scrip, too, but Authority's prices kept changing,
upward. I'm no fiscal theorist; time Mike tried to explain I got
headache. Simply know we were glad to lay hands on this non-money whereas
scrip one accepted reluctantly and not just because we hated Authority.
Hong Kong should have been Party's stronghold. But was not. We had
decided that I should risk face-to-face there, letting some know my
identity, as a man with one arm can't disguise easily. Was risk that
would jeopardize not only me but could lead to Wyoh, Mum, Greg, and
Sidris if I took a fall. But who said revolution was safe?
Comrade Clayton turned out to be young Japanese--not too young, but
they all look young till suddenly look old. He was not all Japanese-Malay and other things--but had Japanese name and household had Japanese
manners; "giri" and "gimu" controlled and it was my good fortune that he
owed much gimu to Wyoh.
Clayton was not convict ancestry; his people had been "volunteers"
marched aboard ship at gunpoint during time Great China consolidated
Earthside empire. I didn't hold it against him; he hated Warden as
bitterly as any old lag.

Met him first at a teahouse--taproom to us L-City types--and for
two hours we talked everything but politics. He made up mind about me,
took me home. My only complaint about Japanese hospitality is those chinhigh baths are too bleeding hot.
But turned out I was not jeopardized. Mama-san was as skilled at
makeup as Sidris, my social arm is very convincing, and a kimona covered
its seam. Met four cells in two days, as "Comrade Bork" and wearing
makeup and kimona and tabi and, if a spy was among them, don't think he
could identify Manuel O'Kelly. I had gone there intensely briefed,
endless figures and projections, and talked about just one thing: famine
in '82, six years away. "You people are lucky, won't be hit so soon. But
now with new tube, you are going to see more and more of your people
turning to wheat and rice and shipping it to catapult head. Your time
will come."
They were impressed. Old organization, as I saw it and from what I
heard, relied on oratory, whoop-it-up music, and emotion, much like
church. I simply said, "There it is, comrades. Check those figures; I'll
leave them with you."
Met one comrade separately. A Chinee engineer given a good look at
anything can figure way to make it. Asked this one if he had ever seen a
laser gun small enough to carry like a rifle. He had not. Mentioned that
passport system made it difficult to smuggle these days. He said
thoughtfully that jewels ought not to be hard--and he would be in Luna
City next week to see his cousin. I said Uncle Adam would be pleased to
hear from him.
All in all was productive trip. On way back I stopped in Novylen to
check an old-fashioned punched-tape "Foreman" I had overhauled earlier,
had lunch afterwards, ran into my father. He and I were friendly but
didn't matter if we let a couple of years go by. We talked through a
sandwich and beer and as I got up he said, "Nice to see you, Mannie. Free
Luna!"
I echoed, too startled not to. My old man was as cynically nonpolitical as you could find; if he would say that in public, campaign
must be taking hold.
So I arrived in L-City cheered up and not too tired, having napped
from Torricelli. Took Belt from Tube South, then dropped down and through
Bottom Alley, avoiding Causeway crowd and heading home. Went into Judge
Brody's courtroom as I came to it, meaning to say hello. Brody is old
friend and we have amputation in common. After he lost a leg he set up as
a judge and was quite successful; was not another judge in L-City at that
time who did not have side business, at least make book or sell
insurance.
If two people brought a quarrel to Brody and he could not get them
to agree that his settlement was just, he would return fees and, if they
fought, referee their duel without charging--and still be trying to
persuade them not to use knives right up to squaring off.
He wasn't in his courtroom though plug hat was on desk. Started to
leave, only to be checked by group coming in, stilyagi types. A girl was
with them, and an older man hustled by them. He was mussed, and clothing
had that vague something that says "tourist."
We used to get tourists even then. Not hordes but quite a few. They
would come up from Earth, stop in a hotel for a week, go back in same
ship or perhaps stop over for next ship. Most of them spent their time
gambling after a day or two of sightseeing including that silly walk up

on surface every tourist makes. Most Loonies ignored them and granted
them their foibles.
One lad, oldest, about eighteen and leader, said to me, "Where's
judge?"
"Don't know. Not here."
He chewed lip, looked baffled. I said, "What trouble?"
He said soberly, "Going to eliminate his choom. But want judge to
confirm it."
I said, "Cover taprooms here around. Probably find him."
A boy about fourteen spoke up. "Say! Aren't you Gospodin O'Kelly?"
"Right."
"Why don't you judge it."
Oldest looked relieved. "Will you, Gospodin?"
I hesitated. Sure, I've gone judge at times; who hasn't? But don't
hanker for responsibility. However, it troubled me to hear young people
talk about eliminating a tourist. Bound to cause talk.
Decided to do it. So I said to tourist, "Will you accept me as your
judge?"
He looked surprised. "I have choice in the matter?"
I said patiently, "Of course. Can't expect me to listen if you
aren't willing to accept my judging. But not urging you. Your life, not
mine."
He looked very surprised but not afraid. His eyes lit up. "My life,
did you say?"
"Apparently. You heard lads say they intend to eliminate you. You
may prefer to wait for Judge Brody."
He didn't hesitate. Smiled and said, "I accept you as my judge,
sir."
"As you wish." I looked at oldest lad. "What parties to quarrel?
Just you and your young friend?"
"Oh, no, Judge, all of us."
"Not your judge yet." I looked around. "Do you all ask me to
judge?"
Were nods; none said No. Leader turned to girl, added, "Better
speak up, Tish. You accept Judge O'Kelly?"
"What? Oh, sure!" She was a vapid little thing, vacantly pretty,
curvy, perhaps fourteen. Slot-machine type, and how she might wind up.
Sort who prefers being queen over pack of stilyagi to solid marriage. I
don't blame stilyagi; they chase around corridors because not enough
females. Work all day and nothing to go home to at night.
"Okay, court has been accepted and all are bound to abide by my
verdict. Let's settle fees. How high can you boys go? Please understand
I'm not going to judge an elimination for dimes. So ante up or I turn him
loose."
Leader blinked, they went into huddle. Shortly he turned and said,
"We don't have much. Will you do it for five Kong dollars apiece?"
Six of them--"No. Ought not to ask a court to judge elimination at
that price."
They huddled again. "Fifty dollars, Judge?"
"Sixty. Ten each. And another ten from you, Tish," I said to girl.
She looked surprised, indignant. "Come, come!" I said. "Tanstaafl."
She blinked and reached into pouch. She had money; types like that
always have.

I collected seventy dollars, laid it on desk, and said to tourist,
"Can match it?"
"Beg pardon?"
"Kids are paying seventy dollars Hong Kong for judgment. You should
match it. If you can't, open pouch and prove it and can owe it to me. But
that's your share." I added, "Cheap, for a capital case. But kids can't
pay much so you get a bargain."
"I see. I believe I see." He matched with seventy Hong Kong.
"Thank you," I said. "Now does either side want a jury?" Girl's
eyes lit up. "Sure! Let's do it right." Earthworm said, "Under the
circumstances perhaps I need one."
"Can have it," I assured. "Want a counsel?"
"Why, I suppose I need a lawyer, too."
"I said 'counsel,' not 'lawyer.' Aren't any lawyers here." Again he
seemed delighted. "I suppose counsel, if I elected to have one, would be
of the same, uh, informal quality as the rest of these proceedings?"
"Maybe, maybe not. I'm informal sort of judge, that's all. Suit
yourself."
"Mm. I think I'll rely on your informality, your honor."
Oldest lad said, "Uh, this jury. You pick up chit? Or do we?"
"I pay it; I agreed to judge for a hundred forty, gross. Haven't
you been in court before? But not going to kill my net for extra I could
do without. Six jurymen, five dollars each. See who's in Alley."
One boy stepped out and shouted, "Jury work! Five-dollar job!"
They rounded up six men and were what you would expect in Bottom
Alley. Didn't worry me as had no intention of paying mind to them. If you
go judge, better in good neighborhood with chance of getting solid
citizens.
I went behind desk, sat down, put on Brody's plug hat--wondered
where he had found it. Probably a castoff from some lodge. "Court's in
session," I said. "Let's have names and tell me beef."
Oldest lad was named. Slim Lemke, girl war Patricia Carmen Zhukov;
don't remember others. Tourist stepped up, reached into pouch and said,
"My card, sir."
I still have it. It read:
STUART RENE LaJOIE
Poet--Traveler--Soldier of Fortune, Beef was tragically ridiculous,
fine example of why tourists should not wander around without guides.
Sure, guides bleed them white--but isn't that what a tourist is for? This
one almost lost life from lack of guidance.
Had wandered into a taproom which lets stilyagi hang out, a sort of
clubroom. This simple female had flirted with him. Boys had let matter
be, as of course they had to as long as she invited it. But at some point
she had laughed and let him have a fist in ribs. He had taken it as
casually as a Loonie would... but had answered in distinctly earthworm
manner; slipped arm around waist and pulled her to him, apparently tried
to kiss her.
Now believe me, in North America this wouldn't matter; I've seen
things much like it. But of course Tish was astonished, perhaps
frightened. She screamed.
And pack of boys set upon him and roughed him up. Then decided he
had to pay for his "crime"--but do it correctly. Find a judge.
Most likely they chickened. Chances are not one had ever dealt with
an elimination. But their lady had been insulted, had to be done.

I questioned them, especially Tish, and decided I had it straight.
Then said, "Let me sum up. Here we have a stranger. Doesn't know our
ways. He offended, he's guilty. But meant no offense far as I can see.
What does jury say? Hey, you there!--wake up! What you say?"
Juryman looked up blearily, said, "'Liminate him!"
"Very well? And you?"
"Well--" Next one hesitated. "Guess it would be enough just to beat
tar out of him, so he'll know better next time. Can't have men pawing
women, or place will get to be as bad as they say Terra is."
"Sensible," I agreed. "And you?"
Only one juror voted for elimination. Others ranged from a beating
to very high fines.
"What do you think, Slim?"
"Well--" He was worried--face in front of gang, face in front of
what might be his girl. But had cooled down and didn't want chum
eliminated. "We already worked him over. Maybe if he got down on hands
and knees and kissed floor in front of Tish and said he was sorry?"
"Will you do that, Gospodin LaJoie?"
"If you so rule, your honor."
"I don't. Here's my verdict. First that juryman--you!--you are
fined fee paid you because you fell asleep while supposed to be judging.
Grab him, boys, take it away from him and throw him out."
They did, enthusiastically; made up a little for greater excitement
they had thought of but really could not stomach. "Now, Gospodin LaJoie,
you are fined fifty Hong Kong for not having common sense to learn local
customs before stirring around. Ante up."
I collected it. "Now you boys line up. You are fined five dollars
apiece for not exercising good judgment in dealing with a person you knew
was a stranger and not used to our ways. Stopping him from touching Tish,
that's fine. Rough him, that's okay, too; he'll learn faster. And could
have tossed him out. But talking about eliminating for what was honest
mistake--well, it's out of proportion. Five bucks each. Ante up.
Slim gulped. "Judge... I don't think we have that much left! At
least I don't."
"I thought that might be. You have a week to pay or I post your
names in Old Dome. Know where Bon Ton Beauté Shoppe is, near easement
lock thirteen? My wife runs it; pay her. Court's out. Slim, don't go
away. Nor you, Tish. Gospodin LaJoie, let's take these young people up
and buy them a cold drink and get better acquainted."
Again his eyes filled with odd delight that reminded of Prof.
"A charming idea, Judge!"
"I'm no longer judge. It's up a couple of ramps... so I suggest you
offer Tish your arm."
He bowed and said, "My lady? May I?" and crooked his elbow to her.
Tish at once became very grown up. "Spasebo, Gospodin! I am pleased."
Took them to expensive place, one where their wild clothes and
excessive makeup looked out of place; they were edgy. But I tried to make
them feel easy and Stuart LaJoie tried even harder and successfully. Got
their addresses as well as names; Wyoh had one sequence which was
concentrating on stilyagi. Presently they finished their coolers, stood
up, thanked and left. LaJoie and I stayed on.
"Gospodin," he said presently, "you used an odd word earlier--odd
to me, I mean."
"Call me 'Mannie' now that kids are gone. What word?"

"It was when you insisted that the, uh, young lady, Tish--that Tish
must pay, too. 'Tone-stapple,' or something like it."
"Oh, 'tanstaafl.' Means ~There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch.' And isn't," I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room,
"or these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything
free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless."
"An interesting philosophy."
"Not philosophy, fact. One way or other, what you get, you pay
for." I fanned air. "Was Earthside once and heard expression 'Free as
air.' This air isn't free, you pay for every breath."
"Really? No one has asked me to pay to breathe." He smiled.
"Perhaps I should stop."
"Can happen, you almost breathed vacuum tonight. But nobody asks
you because you've paid. For you, is part of round-trip ticket; for me
it's a quarterly charge." I started to tell how my family buys and sells
air to community co-op, decided was too complicated. "But we both pay."
LaJoie looked thoughtfully pleased. "Yes, I see the economic
necessity. It's simply new to me. Tell me, uh, Mannie--and I'm called
'Stu'--was I really in danger of 'breathing vacuum'?"
"Should have charged you more."
"Please?"
"You aren't convinced. But charged kids all they could scrape up
and fined them too, to make them think. Couldn't charge you more than
them. Should have, you think it was all a joke."
"Believe me, sir, I do not think it was a joke. I just have trouble
grasping that your local laws permit a man to be put to death... so
casually... and for so trivial an offense."
I sighed. Where do you start explaining when a man's words show
there isn't anything he understands about subject, instead is loaded with
preconceptions that don't fit facts and doesn't even know he has?
"Stu," I said, "let's take that piece at a time. Are no 'local
laws' so you couldn't be 'put to death' under them. Your offense was not
'trivial,' I simply made allowance for ignorance. And wasn't done
casually, or boys would have dragged you to nearest lock to zero
pressure, shoved you in, and cycled. Instead were most formal--good
boys!--and paid own cash to give you a trial. And didn't grumble when
verdict wasn't even close to what they asked. Now, anything still not
clear?"
He grinned and turned out to have dimples like Prof; found myself
liking him still more. "All of it, I'm afraid. I seem to have wandered
into Looking Glass Land."
Expected that; having been Earthside I know how their minds work,
some. An earthworm expects to find a law, a printed law, for every
circumstance. Even have laws for private matters such as contracts.
Really, if a man's word isn't any good, who would contract with him?
Doesn't he have reputation?
"We don't have laws," I said. "Never been allowed to. Have customs,
but aren't written and aren't enforced--or could say they are selfenforcing because are simply way things have to be, conditions being what
they are. Could say our customs are natural laws because are way people
have to behave to stay alive. When you made a pass at Tish you were
violating a natural law... and almost caused you to breathe vacuum."

He blinked thoughtfully. "Would you explain the natural law I
violated? I had better understand it... or best I return to my ship and
stay inboard until lift. To stay alive."
"Certainly. Is so simple that, once you understand, you'll never be
in danger from it again. Here we are, two million males, less than one
million females. A physical fact, basic as rock or vacuum. Then add idea
of tanstaafl. When thing is scarce, price goes up. Women are scarce;
aren't enough to go around--that makes them most valuable thing in Luna,
more precious than ice or air, as men without women don't care whether
they stay alive or not. Except a Cyborg, if you regard him as a man,
which I don't."
I went on: "So what happens?--and mind you, things were even worse
when this custom, or natural law, first showed itself back in twentieth
century. Ratio was ten-to-one or worse then. One thing is what always
happens in prisons: men turn to other men. That helps not much; problem
still is because most men want women and won't settle for substitute
while chance of getting true gelt.
"They get so anxious they will kill for it... and from stories oldtimers tell was killing enough to chill your teeth in those days. But
after a while those still alive find way to get along, things shake down.
As automatic as gravitation. Those who adjust to facts stay alive; those
who don't are dead and no problem.
"What that means, here and now, is that women are scarce and call
tune... and you are surrounded by two million men who see to it you dance
to that tune. You have no choice, she has all choice. She can hit you so
hard it draws blood; you dasn't lay a finger on her. Look, you put an arm
around Tish, maybe tried to kiss. Suppose instead she had gone to hotel
room with you; what would happen?"
"Heavens! I suppose they would have torn me to pieces."
"They would have done nothing. Shrugged and pretended not to see.
Because choice is hers. Not yours. Not theirs. Exclusively hers. Oh, be
risky to ask her to go to hotel; she might take offense and that would
give boys license to rough you up. But--well, take this Tish. A silly
little tart. If you had flashed as much money as I saw in your pouch, she
might have taken into head that a bundle with tourist was just what she
needed and suggested it herself. In which case would have been utterly
safe."
Lajoie shivered. "At her age? It scares me to think of it. She's
below the age of consent. Statutory rape."
"Oh, bloody! No such thing. Women her age are married or ought to
be. Stu, is no rape in Luna. None. Men won't permit. If rape had been
involved, they wouldn't have bothered to find a judge and all men in
earshot would have scrambled to help. But chance that a girl that big is
virgin is negligible. When they're little, their mothers watch over them,
with help from everybody in city; children are safe here. But when they
reach husband-high, is no holding them and mothers quit trying. If they
choose to run corndors and have fun, can't stop 'em; once a girl is
nubile, she's her own boss. You married?"
"No." He added with a smile; "Not at present."
"Suppose you were and wife told you she was marrying again. What
would you do?"
"Odd that you should pick that, something like it did happen. I saw
my attorney and made sure she got no alimony."

"'Alimony' isn't a word here; I learned it Earthside. Here you
might--or a Loonie husband might--say, 'I think we'll need a bigger
place, dear.' Or might simply congratulate her and his new co-husband. Or
if it made him so unhappy he couldn't stand it, might opt out and pack
clothes. But whatever, would not make slightest fuss. If he did, opinion
would be unanimous against him. His friends, men and women alike, would
snub him. Poor sod would probably move to Novylen, change name and hope
to live it down.
"All our customs work that way. If you're out in field and a cobber
needs air, you lend him a bottle and don't ask cash. But when you're both
back in pressure again, if he won't pay up, nobody would criticize if you
eliminated him without a judge. But he would pay; air is almost as sacred
as women. If you take a new chum in a poker game, you give him air money.
Not eating money; can work or starve. If you eliminate a man other than
self-defense, you pay his debts and support his kids, or people won't
speak to you, buy from you, sell to you."
"Mannie, you're telling me that I can murder a man here and settle
the matter merely with money?"
"Oh, not at all! But eliminating isn't against some law; are no
laws--except Warden's regulations--and Warden doesn't care what one
Loonie does to another. But we figure this way: If a man is killed,
either he had it coming and everybody knows it--usual case--or his
friends will take care of it by eliminating man who did it. Either way,
no problem. Nor many eliminations. Even set duels aren't common."
"'His friends will take care of it.' Mannie, suppose those young
people had gone ahead? I have no friends here."
"Was reason I agreed to judge. While I doubt if those kids could
have egged each other into it, didn't want to take chance. Eliminating a
tourist could give our city a bad name."
"Does it happen often?"
"Can't recall has ever happened. Of course may have been made to
look like accident. A new chum is accident-prone; Luna is that sort of
place. They say if a new chum lives a year, he'll live forever. But
nobody sells him insurance first year." Glanced at time. "Stu, have you
had dinner?"
"No, and I was about to suggest that you come to my hotel. The
cooking is good. Auberge Orleans."
I repressed shudder--ate there once. "Instead, would you come home
with me and meet my family? We have soup or something about this hour."
"Isn't that an imposition?"
"No. Half a minute while I phone."
Mum said, "Manuel! How sweet, dear! Capsule has been in for hours;
I had decided it would be tomorrow or later."
"Just drunken debauchery, Mimi, and evil companions. Coming home
now if can remember way--and bringing evil companion."
"Yes, dear. Dinner in twenty minutes; try not to be late."
"Don't you want to know whether my evil companion is male or
female?"
"Knowing you, I assume that it is female. But I fancy I shall be
able to tell when I see her."
"You know me so well, Mum. Warn girls to look pretty; wouldn't want
a visitor to outshine them."
"Don't be too long; dinner will spoil. 'Bye, dear. Love."

"Love, Mum." I waited, then punched MYCROFTXXX. "Mike, want a name
searched. Earthside name, passenger in Popov. Stuart Rene LaJoie. Stuart
with a U and last name might file under either L or J."
Didn't wait many seconds; Mike found Stu in all major Earthside
references: Who's Who, Dun & Bradstreet, Almanach de Gotha, London Times
running files, name it. French expatriate, royalist, wealthy, six more
names sandwiched into ones he used, three university degrees including
one in law from Sorbonne, noble ancestry both France and Scotland,
divorced (no children) from Honorable Pamela Hyphen-Hyphen-Blueblood.
Sort of earthworm who wouldn't speak to a Loonie of convict ancestry-except Stu would speak to anyone.
I listened a pair of minutes, then asked Mike to prepare a full
dossier, following all associational leads. "Mike, might be our pigeon."
"Could be, Man."
"Got to run. 'Bye." Returned thoughtfully to my guest. Almost a
year earlier, during alcoholic talk-talk in a hotel room, Mike had
promised us one chance in seven--if certain things were done. One sinequa-non was help on Terra itself.
Despite "throwing rocks," Mike knew, we all knew, that mighty Terra
with eleven billion people and endless resources could not be defeated by
three million who had nothing, even though we stood on a high place and
could drop rocks on them.
Mike drew parallels from XVIIIth century, when Britain's American
colonies broke away, and from XXth, when many colonies became independent
of several empires, and pointed out that in no case had a colony broken
loose by brute force. No, in every case imperial state was busy
elsewhere, had grown weary and given up without using full strength.
For months we had been strong enough, had we wished, to overcome
Warden's bodyguards. Once our catapult was ready (anytime now) we would
not be helpless. But we needed a "favorable climate" on Terra. For that
we needed help on Terra.
Prof had not regarded it as difficult. But turned out to be quite
difficult. His Earthside friends were dead or nearly and I had never had
any but a few teachers. We sent inquiry down through cells: "What vips do
you know Earthside?" and usual answer was: "You kidding?" Null program-Prof watched passenger lists on incoming ships, trying to figure a
contact, and had been reading Luna print-outs of Earthside newspapers,
searching for vips he could reach through past connection. I had not
tried; handful I had met on Terra were not vips.
Prof had not picked Stu off Popov's passenger list. But Prof had
not met him. I didn't not know whether Stu was simply eccentric as odd
personal card seemed to show. But he was only Terran I had ever had a
drink with in Luna, seemed a dinkum cobber, and Mike's report showed
hunch was not all bad; he carried some tonnage.
So I took him home to see what family thought of him.
Started well. Mum smiled and offered hand. He took it and bowed so
deep I thought he was going to kiss it--would have, I think, had I not
warned him about fems. Mum was cooing as she led him in to dinner.

April and May '76 were more hard work and increasing effort to stir up
Loonies against Warden, and goad him into retaliation. Trouble with Mort
the Wart was that he was not a bad egg, nothing to hate about him other
than fact he was symbol of Authority; was necessary to frighten him to
get him to do anything. And average Loonie was just as bad. He despised
Warden as matter of ritual but was not stuff that makes revolutionists;
he couldn't be bothered. Beer, betting, women, and work--Only thing that
kept Revolution from dying of anemia was that Peace Dragoons had real
talent for antagonizing.
But even them we had to keep stirred up. Prof kept saying we needed
a "Boston Tea Party," referring to mythical incident in an earlier
revolution, by which he meant a public ruckus to grab attention.
We kept trying. Mike rewrote lyrics of old revolutionary songs:
"Marseillaise,"
"Internationale,"
"Yankee Doodle,"
"We Shall Overcome,"
"Pie in the Sky," etc., giving them words to fit Luna. Stuff like
"Sons of Rock and Boredom/Will you let the Warden/Take from you your
libertee!" Simon Jester spread them around, and when one took hold, we
pushed it (music only) by radio and video. This put Warden in silly
position of forbidding playing of certain tunes--which suited us; people
could whistle.
Mike studied voice and word-choice patterns of Deputy
Administrator, Chief Engineer, other department heads; Warden started
getting frantic calls at night from his staff. Which they denied making.
So Alvarez put lock-and-trace on next one--and sure enough, with Mike's
help, Alvarez traced it to supply chief's phone and was sure it was boss
belly-robber's voice.
But next poison call to Mort seemed to come from Alvarez, and what
Mort had to say next day to Alvarez and what Alvaiez said in own defense
can only be described as chaotic crossed with psychotic.
Prof had Mike stop; was afraid Alvarez might lose job, which we did
not want; he was doing too well for us. But by then Peace Dragoons had
been dragged out twice in night on what seemed to be Warden's orders,
further disrupting morale, and Warden became convinced he was surrounded
by traitors in official family while they were sure he had blown every
circuit.
An ad appeared in Lunaya Pravda announcing lecture by Dr. Adam
Selene on Poetry and Arts in Luna: a New Renaissance. No comrade
attended; word went down cells to stay away. Nor did anybody hang around
when three squads of Peace Dragoons showed up--this involves Heisenberg
principle as applied to Scarlet Pimpernels. Editor of Pravda spent bad
hour explaining that he did not accept ads in person and this one was
ordered over counter and paid for in cash. He was told not to take ads
from Adam Selene. This was countermanded and he was told to take anything
from Adam Selene but notify Alvarez at once.
New catapult was tested with a load dropped into south Indian Ocean
at 350 E., 600 S., a spot used only by fish. Mike was joyed over his
marksmanship since he had been able to sneak only two looks when guidance
& tracking radars were not in use and had relied on just one nudge to
bring it to bullseye. Earthside news reported giant meteor in sub-

Antarctic picked up by Capetown Spacetrack with projected impact that
matched Mike's attempt perfectly--Mike called me to boast while taking
down evening's Reuters transmission. "I told you it was dead on," he
gloated. "I watched it. Oh, what a lovely splash!" Later reports on shock
wave from seismic labs and on tsunamis from oceanographic stations were
consistent.
Was only canister we had ready (trouble buying steel) or Mike might
have demanded to try his new toy again.
Liberty Caps started appearing on stilyagi and their girls; Simon
Jester began wearing one between his horns. Bon Marche gave them away as
premiums. Alvarez had painful talk with Warden in which Mort demanded to
know if his fink boss felt that something should be done every time kids
took up fad? Had Alvarez gone out of his mind?
I ran across Slim Lemke on Carver Causeway early May; he was
wearing a Liberty Cap. He seemed pleased to see me and I thanked him for
prompt payment (he had come in three days after Stu's trial and paid
Sidris thirty Hong Kong, for gang) and bought him a cooler. While we were
seated I asked why young people were wearing red hats? Why a hat? Hat's
were an earthworm custom, nyet?
He hesitated, then said was sort of a lodge, like Elks. I changed
subject. Learned that his full name was Moses Lemke Stone; member of
Stone Gang. This pleased me, we were relatives. But surprised me.
However, even best families such as Stones sometimes can't always find
marriages for all sons; I had been lucky or might have been roving
corridors at his age, too. Told him about our connection on my mother's
side.
He warmed up and shortly said, "Cousin Manuel, ever think about how
we ought to elect our own Warden?"
I said No, I hadn't; Authority appointed him and I supposed they
always would. He asked why we had to have an Authority? I asked who had
been putting ideas in head? He insisted nobody had, just thinking, was
all--didn't he have a right to think?
When I got home was tempted to check with Mike, find out lad's
Party name if any. But wouldn't have been proper security, nor fair to
Slim.
On 3 May '76 seventy-one males named Simon were rounded up and
questioned, then released. No newspaper carried story. But everybody
heard it; we were clear down in "J's" and twelve thousand people can
spread a story faster than I would have guessed. We emphasized that one
of these dangerous males was only four years old, which was not true but
very effective.
Stu Lajoie stayed with us during February and March and did not
return to Terra until early April; he changed his ticket to next ship and
then to next. When I pointed out that he was riding close to invisible
line where irreversible physiological changes could set in, he grinned
and told me not to worry. But made arrangements to use centrifuge.
Stu did not want to leave even by April. Was kissed goodbye with
tears by all my wives and Wyoh, and he assured each one he was coming
back. But left as he had work to do; by then he was a Party member.
I did not take part in decision to recruit Stu; I felt prejudiced.
Wyoh and Prof and Mike were unanimous in risking it; I happily accepted
their judgment.
We all helped to sell Stu LaJoie--self, Prof, Mike, Wyoh, Mum, even
Sidris and Lenore and Ludmilla and our kids and Hans and Ali and Frank,

as Davis home life was what grabbed him first. Did not hurt that Lenore
was prettiest girl in L-City--which is no disparagement of Milla, Wyoh,
Anna, and Sidris. Nor did it hurt that Stu could charm a baby away from
breast. Mom fussed over him, Hans showed him hydroponic farming and Stu
got dirty and sweaty and sloshed around in tunnels with our boys--helped
harvest our Chinee fishponds--got stung by our bees--learned to handle a
p-suit and went up with me to make adjustments on solar battery--helped
Anna butcher a hog and learned about tanning leather--sat with Grandpaw
and was respectful to his naive notions about Terra--washed dishes with
Milla, something no male in our family ever did--rolled on floor with
babies and puppies--learned to grind flour and swapped recipes with Mum.
I introduced him to Prof and that started political side of feeling
him out. Nothing had been admitted--we could back away--when Prof
introduced him to "Adam Selene" who could visit only by phone as he was
"in Hong Kong at present." By time Stu was committed to Cause, we dropped
pretense and let him know that Adam was chairman whom he would not meet
in person for security reasons.
But Wyoh did most and was on her judgment that Prof turned cards up
and let Stu know that we were building a revolution. Was no surprise; Stu
had made up mind and was waiting for us to trust him.
They say a face once launched a thousand ships. I do not know that
Wyoh used anything but argument on Stu. I never tried to find out. But
Wyoh had more to do with committing me than all Prof's theory or Mike's
figures. If Wyoh used even stronger methods on Stu, she was not first
heroine in history to do so for her country.
Stu went Earthside with a special codebook. I'm no code and cipher
expert except that a computerman learns principles during study of
information theory. A cipher is a mathematical pattern under which one
letter substitutes for another, simplest being one in which alphabet is
merely scrambled.
A cipher can be incredibly subtle, especially with help of a
computer. But ciphers all have weakness that they are patterns. If one
computer can think them up, another computer can break them.
Codes do not have same weakness. Let's say that codebook has letter
group GLOPS. Does this mean "Aunt Minnie will be home Thursday" or does
it mean "3 .14157... "?
Meaning is whatever you assign and no computer can analyze it
simply from letter group. Give a computer enough groups and a rational
theory involving meanings or subjects for meanings, and it will
eventually worry it out because meanings themselves will show patterns.
But is a problem of different kind on more difficult level.
Code we selected was commonest commercial codebook, used both on
Terra and in Luna for commercial dispatches. But we worked it over. Prof
and Mike spent hours discussing what information Party might wish to send
to its agent on Terra, or receive from agent, then Mike put his vast
information to work and came up with new set of meanings for codebook,
ones that could say "Buy Thai rice futures" as easily as "Run for life;
they've caught us." Or anything, as cipher signals were buried in it to
permit anything to be said that had not been anticipated.
Late one night Mike made print-out of new code via Lunaya Pravda's
facilities, and night editor turned roll over to another comrade who
converted it into a very small roll of film and passed it along in turn,
and none ever knew what they handled or why. Wound up in Stu's pouch.
Search of off-planet luggage was tight by then and conducted by bad-

tempered Dragoons--but Stu was certain he would have no trouble. Perhaps
he swallowed it.
Thereafter some of LuNoHo Company's dispatches to Terra reached Stu
via his London broker.
Part of purpose was financial. Party needed to spend money
Earthside; LuNoHoCo transferred money there (not all stolen, some
ventures turned out well); Party needed still more money Earthside, Stu
was to speculate, acting on secret knowledge of plan of Revolution--he,
Prof, and Mike had spent hours discussing what stocks would go up, what
would go down, etc., after Der Tag. This was Prof's pidgin; I am not that
sort of gambler.
But money was needed before Der Tag to build "climate of opinion."
We needed publicity, needed delegates and senators in Federated Nations,
needed some nation to recognize us quickly once The Day came, we needed
laymen telling other laymen over a beer: "What is there on that pile of
rock worth one soldier's life? Let 'em go to hell in their own way, I
say!"
Money for publicity, money for bribes, money for dummy
organizations and to infiltrate established organizations; money to get
true nature of Luna's economy (Stu had gone loaded with figures) brought
out as scientific research, then in popular form; money to convince
foreign office of at least one major nation that there was advantage in a
Free Luna; money to sell idea of Lunar tourism to a major cartel-- Too
much money! Stu offered own fortune and Prof did not discourage it--Where
treasure is, heart will be. But still too much money and far too much to
do. I did not know if Stu could swing a tenth of it; simply kept fingers
crossed. At least it gave us a channel to Terra. Prof claimed that
communications to enemy were essential to any war if was to be fought and
settled sensibly. (Prof was a pacifist. Like his vegetarianism, he did
not let it keep him from being "rational." Would have made a terrific
theologian.)
As soon as Stu went Earthside, Mike set odds at one in thirteen. I
asked him what in hell? "But, Man," he explained patiently, "it increases
risk. That it is necessary risk does not change the fact that risk is
increased."
I shut up. About that time, early May, a new factor reduced some
risks while revealing others. One part of Mike handled Terra-Luna
microwave traffic--commercial messages, scientific data, news channels,
video, voice radiotelephony, routine Authority traffic--and Warden's top
secret.
Aside from last, Mike could read any of this including commercial
codes and ciphers--breaking ciphers was a crossword puzzle to him and
nobody mistrusted this machine. Except Warden, and I suspect that his was
distrust of all machinery; was sort of person who finds anything more
involved than a pair of scissors complex, mysterious, and suspect--Stone
Age mind.
Warden used a code that Mike never saw. Also used ciphers and did
not work them through Mike; instead he had a moronic little machine in
residence office. On top of this he had arrangement with Authority
Earthside to switch everything around at preset times. No doubt he felt
safe.
Mike broke his cipher patterns and deduced time-change program just
to try legs. He did not tackle code until Prof suggested it; it held no
interest for him.

But once Prof asked, Mike tackled Warden's top-secret messages. He
had to start from scratch; in past Mike had erased Warden's messages once
transmission was reported. So slowly, slowly he accumulated data for
analysis--painfully slow, for Warden used this method only when he had
to. Sometimes a week would pass between such messages. But gradually Mike
began to gather meanings for letter groups, each assigned a probability.
A code does not crack all at once; possible to know meanings of ninetynine groups in a message and miss essence because one group is merely
GLOPS to you.
However, user has a problem, too; if GLOPS comes through as GLOPT,
he's in trouble. Any method of communication needs redundancy, or
information can be lost. Was at redundancy that Mike nibbled, with
perfect patience of machine.
Mike solved most of Warden's code sooner than he had projected;
Warden was sending more traffic than in past and most of it one subject
(which helped)--subject being security and subversion.
We had Mort in a twitter; he was yelling for help.
He reported subversive activities still going on despite two
phalanges of Peace Dragoons and demanded enough troops to station guards
in all key spots inside all warrens.
Authority told him this was preposterous, no more of FN's crack
troops could be spared--to be permanently ruined for Earthside duties-and such requests should not be made. If he wanted more guards, he must
recruit them from transportees-but such increase in administrative costs
must be absorbed in Luna; he would not be allowed more overhead. He was
directed to report what steps be had taken to meet new grain quotas set
in our such-and-such.
Warden replied that unless extremely moderate requests for trained
security personnel--not-repeat-not untrained, unreliable, and unfit
convicts--were met, he could no longer assure civil order, much less
increased quotas.
Reply asked sneeringly what difference it made if exconsignees
chose to riot among themselves in their holes? If it worried him, had he
thought of shutting off lights as was used so successfully in 1996 and
2021?
These exchanges caused us to revise our calendar, to speed some
phases, slow others. Like a perfect dinner, a revolution has to be
"cooked" so that everything comes out even. Stu needed time Earthside. We
needed canisters and small steering rockets and associated circuitry for
"rock throwing." And steel was a problem--buying it, fabricating it, and
above all moving it through meander of tunnels to new catapult site. We
needed to increase Party at least into "K's"--say 40, 000--with lowest
echelons picked for fighting spirit rather than talents we had sought
earlier. We needed weapons against landings. We needed to move Mike's
radars without which he was blind. (Mike could not be moved; bits of him
spread all through Luna. But he had a thousand meters of rock over that
central part of him at Complex, was surrounded by steel and this armor
was cradled in springs; Authority had contemplated that someday somebody
might lob H-weapons at their control center.)
All these needed to be done and pot must not boil too soon.
So we cut down on things that worried Warden and tried to speed up
everything else. Simon Jester took a holiday. Word went out that Liberty
Caps were not stylish--but save them. Warden got no more nervous-making

phone calls. We quit inciting incidents with Dragoons-which did not stop
them but reduced number.
Despite efforts to quiet Mort's worries a symptom showed up which
disquieted us instead. No message (at least we intercepted none) reached
Warden agreeing to his demand for more troops--but he started moving
people out of Complex. Civil servants who lived there started looking for
holes to rent in L-City. Authority started test drills and resonance
exploration in a cubic adjacent to L. City which could be converted into
a warren.
Could mean that Authority proposed shipping up unusually large
draft of prisoners. Could mean that space in Complex was needed for
purpose other than quarters. But Mike told us: "Why kid yourselves? The
Warden is going to get those troops; that space will be their barracks.
Any other explanation I would have heard."
I said, "But Mike, why didn't you hear if it's troops? You have
that code of Warden's fairly well whipped."
"Not just 'fairly well,' I've got it whipped. But the last two
ships have carried Authority vips and I don't know what they talk about
away from phones!"
So we tried to plan to cover possibility of having to cope with ten
more phalanges, that being Mike's estimate of what cubic being cleared
would hold. We could deal with that many--with Mike's help--but it would
mean deaths, not bloodless coup d'etat Prof had planned.
And we increased efforts to speed up other factors.
When suddenly we found ourselves committed--

13
Her name was Marie Lyons; she was eighteen years old and born in Luna,
mother having been exiled via Peace Corps in '56. No record of father.
She seems to have been a harmless person. Worked as a stock-control clerk
in shipping department, lived in Complex.
Maybe she hated Authority and enjoyed teasing Peace Dragoons. Or
perhaps it started as a commercial transaction as cold-blooded as any in
a crib behind a slot-machine lock. How can we know? Six Dragoons were in
it. Not satisfied with raping her (if rape it was) they abused her other
ways and killed her. But they did not dispose of body neatly; another
civil service fem found it before was cold. She screamed. Was her last
scream.
We heard about it at once; Mike called us three while Alvarez and
Peace Dragoon C. O. were digging into matter in Alvarez's office. Appears
that Peace Goon boss had no trouble laying hands on guilty; he and
Alvarez were questioning them one at a time, and quarreling between
grillings. Once we heard Alvarez say: "I told you those goons of yours
had to have their own women! I warned you!"
"Stuff it," Dragoon officer answered. "I've told you time and again
they won't ship any. The question now is how we hush this up."
"Are you crazy? Warden already knows."

"It's still the question."
"Oh, shut up and send in the next one."
Early in filthy story Wyoh joined me in workshop. Was pale under
makeup, said nothing but wanted to sit close and clench my hand.
At last was over and Dragoon officer left Alvarez. Were still
quarreling. Alvarez wanted those six executed at once and fact made
public (sensible but not nearly enough, for his needs); C. O. was still
talking about "hushing it up." Prof said, "Mike, keep an ear there and
listen where else you can. Well, Mike? Wyoh? Plans?"
I didn't have any. Wasn't a cold, shrewd revolutionist; just wanted
to get my heel into faces that matched those six voices. "I don't know.
What do we do, Prof?"
"'Do'? We're on our tiger; we grab its ears. Mike. Where's Finn
Nielsen? Find him."
Mike answered, "He's calling now." He cut Finn in with us; I heard:
"--at Tube South. Both guards dead and about six of our people. Just
people, I mean, not necessarily comrades. Some wild rumor about Goons
going crazy and raping and killing all women at Complex. Adam, I had
better talk to Prof."
"I'm here, Finn," Prof answered in a strong, confident voice. "Now
we move, we've got to. Switch off and get those laser guns and men who
trained with them, any you can round up."
"Da! Okay, Adam?"
"Do as Prof says. Then call back."
"Hold it, Finn!" I cut in. "Mannie here. I want one of those guns."
"You haven't practiced, Mannie."
"If it's a laser, I can use it!"
"Mannie," Prof said forcefully, "shut up. You're wasting time; let
Finn go. Adam. Message for Mike. Tell him Plan Alert Four."
Prof's example damped my oscillating. Had forgotten that Finn was
not supposed to know Mike was anybody but "Adam Selene"; forgotten
everything but raging anger. Mike said, "Finn has switched off, Prof, and
I put Alert Four on standby when this broke. No traffic now except
routine stuff filed earlier. You don't want it interrupted, do you?"
"No, just follow Alert Four. No Earthside transmission either way
that tips any news. If one comes in, hold it and consult." Alert Four was
emergency communication doctrine, intended to slap censorship on news to
Terra without arousing suspicion. For this Mike was ready to talk in many
voices with excuses as to why a direct voice transmission would be
delayed--and any taped transmission was no problem.
"Program running," agreed Mike.
"Good. Mannie, calm down, son, and stick to your knitting. Let
other people do the fighting; you're needed here, we're going to have to
improvise. Wyoh, cut out and get word to Comrade Cecilia to get all
Irregulars out of the corridors. Get those children home and keep them
home--and have their mothers urging other mothers to do the same thing.
We don't know where the fighting will spread. But we don't want children
hurt if we can help it."
"Right away, Prof!"
"Wait. As soon as you've told Sidris, get moving on your stilyagi.
I want a riot at the Authority's city office--break in, wreck the place,
and noise and shouting and destruction--no one hurt if it can be helped.
Mike. Alert-Four-Em. Cut off the Complex except for your own lines."
"Prof!" I demanded. "What sense in starting riots here?"

"Mannie, Mannie! This is The Day! Mike, has the rape and murder
news reached other warrens?"
"Not that I've heard. I'm listening here and there with random
jumps. Tube stations are quiet except Luna City. Fighting has just
started at Tube Station West. Want to hear it?"
"Not now. Mannie, slide over there and watch it. But stay out of it
and slick close to a phone. Mike, start trouble in all warrens. Pass the
news down the cells and use Finn's version, not the truth. The Goons are
raping and killing all the women in the Complex--I'll give you details or
you can invent them. Uh, can you order the guards at tube stations in
other warrens back to their barracks? I want riots but there is no point
in sending unarmed people against armed men if we can dodge it."
"I'll try."
I hurried to Tube Station West, slowed as I neared it. Corridors
were full of angry people. City roared in way I had never heard before
and, as I crossed Causeway, could hear shouts and crowd noise from
direction of Authority's city office although it seemed to me there had
not been time for Wyoh to reach her stilyagi--nor had there been; what
Prof had tried to start was under way spontaneously.
Station was mobbed and I had to push through to see what I assumed
to be certain, that passport guards were either dead or fled. 'Dead' it
turned out, along with three Loonies. One was a boy not more than
thirteen. He had died with his hands on a Dragoon's throat and his head
still sporting a little red cap. I pushed way to a public phone and
reported.
"Go back," said Prof. "and read the I. D. of one of those guards. I
want name and rank. Have you seen Finn?"
"No."
"He's headed there with three guns. Tell me where the booth you're
in is, get that name and come back to it."
One body was gone, dragged away; Bog knows what they wanted with
it. Other had been badly battered but I managed to crowd in and snatch
dog chain from neck before it, too, was taken somewhere. I elbowed back
to phone, found a woman at it. "Lady," I said, "I've got to use that
phone. Emergency!"
"You're welcome to it! Pesky thing's out of order."
Worked for me; Mike bad saved it. Gave Prof guard's name. "Good,"
he said. "Have you seen Finn? He'll be looking for you at that booth."
"Haven't s--Hold it, just spotted him."
"Okay, hang onto him. Mike, do you have a voice to fit that
Dragoon's name?"
"Sorry, Prof. No."
"All right, just make it hoarse and frightened; chances are the C.
O. won't know it that well. Or would the trooper call Alvarez?"
"He would call his C. O. Alvarez gives orders through him."
"So call the C. O. Report the attack and call for help and die in
the middle of it. Riot sounds behind you and maybe a shout of 'There's
the dirty bastard now!' just before you die. Can you swing it?"
'Programmed. No huhu," Mike said cheerfully.
"Run it. Mannie, put Finn on."
Prof's plan was to sucker off-duty guards out of barracks and keep
suckering them--with Finn's men posted to pick them off as they got out
of capsules. And it worked, right up to point where Mort the Wart lost

his nerve and kept remaining few to protect himself while he sent frantic
messages Earthside--none of which got through.
I wiggled out of Prof's discipline and took a laser gun when second
capsule of Peace Dragoons was due. I burned two Goons, found blood lust
gone and let other snipers have rest of squad. Too easy. They would stick
heads up out of hatch and that would be that. Half of squad would not
come out--until smoked out and then died with rest. By that time I was
back at my advance post at phone.
Warden's decision to hole up caused trouble at Complex; Alvarez was
killed and so was Goon C. O. and two of original yellow jackets. But a
mixed lot of Dragoons and yellows, thirteen, holed up with Mort, or
perhaps were already with him; Mike's ability to follow events by
listening was spotty. But once it seemed clear that all armed effectives
were inside Warden's residence, Prof ordered Mike to start next phase.
Mike turned out all lights in Complex save those in Warden's
residence, and reduced oxygen to gasping point--not killing point but low
enough to insure that anyone looking for trouble would not be in shape.
But in residence, oxygen supply was cut to zero, leaving pure nitrogen,
and left that way ten minutes. At end of that time Finn's men, waiting in
p-suits at Warden's private tube station, broke latch on airlock and went
in, "shoulder to shoulder." Luna was ours.

Book Two
A RABBLE IN ARMS

14
So a wave of patriotism swept over our new nation and unified it.
Isn't that what histories say? Oh, brother!
My dinkum word, preparing a revolution isn't as much huhu as having
won it. Here we were, in control too soon, nothing ready and a thousand
things to do. Authority in Luna was gone--but Lunar Authority Earthside
and Federated Nations behind it were very much alive. Had they landed one
troopship, orbited one cruiser, anytime next week or two, could have
taken Luna back cheap. We were a mob.
New catapult had been tested but canned rock missiles ready to go
you could count on fingers of one hand--my left hand. Nor was catapult a
weapon that could be used against ships, nor against troops. We had
notions for fighting off ships; at moment were just notions. We had a few
hundred cheap laser guns stockpiled in Hong Kong Luna--Chinee engineers
are smart--but few men trained to use them.
Moreover, Authority had useful functions. Bought ice and grain,
sold air and water and power, held ownership or control at a dozen key
points. No matter what was done in future, wheels had to turn. Perhaps
wrecking city offices of Authority had been hasty (I thought so) as
records were destroyed. However, Prof maintained that Loonies, all

Loonies, needed a symbol to hate and destroy and those offices were least
valuable and most public.
But Mike controlled communications and that meant control of most
everything. Prof had started with control of news to and from Earthside,
leaving to Mike censorship and faking of news until we could get around
to what to tell Terra, and had added sub-phase "M" which cut off Complex
from rest of Luna, and with it Richardson Observatory and associated
laboratories--Pierce Radioscope, Selenophysical Station, and so forth.
These were a problem as Terran scientists were always coming and going
and staying as long as six months, stretching time by centrifuge. Most
Terrans in Luna, save for a handful of tourists--thirty-four--were
scientists. Something had to be done about these Terrans, but meanwhile
keeping them from talking to Terra was enough.
For time being, Complex was cut off by phone and Mike did not
permit capsules to stop at any station in Complex even after travel was
resumed, which it was as soon as Finn Nielsen and squad were through with
dirty work.
Turned out Warden was not dead, nor had we planned to kill him;
Prof figured that a live warden could always be made dead, whereas a dead
one could not be made live if we needed him. So plan was to half kill
him, make sure he and his guards could put up no fight, then break in
fast while Mike restored oxygen.
With fans turning at top speed, Mike computed it would take four
minutes and a bit to reduce oxygen to effective zero--so, five minutes of
increasing hypoxia, five minutes of anoxia, then force lower lock while
Mike shot in pure oxygen to restore balance. This should not kill anyone-but would knock out a person as thoroughly as anesthesia. Hazard to
attackers would come from some or all of those inside having p-suits. But
even that might not matter; hypoxia is sneaky, you can pass out without
realizing you are short on oxygen. Is new chum's favorite fatal mistake.
So Warden lived through it and three of his women. But Warden,
though he lived, was no use; brain had been oxygen-starved too long, a
vegetable. No guard recovered, even though younger than he; would appear
anoxia broke necks.
In rest of Complex nobody was hurt. Once lights were on and oxygen
restored they were okay, including six rapist-murderers under lock in
barracks. Finn decided that shooting was too good for them, so he went
judge and used his squad as jury.
They were stripped, hamstrung at ankles and wrists, turned over to
women in Complex. Makes me sick to think about what happened next but
don't suppose they lived through as long an ordeal as Marie Lyons
endured. Women are amazing creatures--sweet, soft, gentle, and far more
savage than we are.
Let me mention those fink spies out of order. Wyoh had been
fiercely ready to eliminate them but when we got around to them she had
lost stomach. I expected Prof to agree. But he shook head. "No, dear
Wyoh, much as I deplore violence, there are only two things to do with an
enemy: Kill him. Or make a friend of him. Anything in between piles up
trouble for the future. A man who finks on his friends once will do it
again and we have a long period ahead in which a fink can be dangerous;
they must go. And publicly, to cause others to be thoughtful."
Wyoh said, "Professor, you once said that if you condemned a man,
you would eliminate him personally. Is that what you are going to do?"

"Yes, dear lady, and no. Their blood shall be on my hands; I accept
responsibility. But I have in mind a way more likely to discourage other
finks."
So Adam Selene announced that these persons had been employed by
Juan Alvarez, late Security Chief for former Authority, as undercover
spies--and gave names and addresses. Adam did not suggest that anything
be done.
One man remained on dodge for seven months by changing warrens and
name. Then early in '77 his body was found outside Novylen's lock. But
most of them lasted no more than hours.
During first hours after coup d'etat we were faced with a problem
we had never managed to plan--Adam Selene himself. Who is Adam Selene?
Where is he? This is his revolution; he handled every detail, every
comrade knows his voice. We're out in open now... so where is Adam?
We batted it around much of that night, in room L of Raffles-argued it between decisions on a hundred things that came up and people
wanted to know what to do, while "Adam" through other voices handled
other decisions that did not require talk, composed phony news to send
Earthside, kept Complex isolated, many things. (Is no possible doubt:
without Mike we could not have taken Luna nor held it.)
My notion was that Prof should become "Adam." Prof was always our
planner and theoretician; everybody knew him; some key comrades knew that
he was "Comrade Bill" and all others knew and respected Professor
Bernardo de la Paz--My word, he had taught half of leading citizens in
Luna City, many from other warrens, was known to every vip in Luna.
"No," said Prof.
"Why not?" asked Wyoh. "Prof. you're opted. Tell him, Mike."
"Comment reserved," said Mike. "I want to hear what Prof has to
say."
"I say you've analyzed it, Mike," Prof answered. "Wyoh dearest
comrade, I would not refuse were it possible. But there is no way to make
my voice match that of Adam--and every comrade knows Adam by his voice;
Mike made it memorable for that very purpose."
We then considered whether Prof could be slipped in anyhow, showing
him only on video and letting Mike reshape whatever Prof said into voice
expected from Adam.
Was turned down. Too many people knew Prof, had heard him speak;
his voice and way of speaking could not be reconciled with Adam. Then
they considered same possibility for me--my voice and Mike's were
baritone and not too many people knew what I sounded like over phone and
none over video.
I tromped on it. People were going to be surprised enough to find
me one of our Chairman's lieutenants; they would never believe I was
number one.
I said, "Let's combine deals. Adam has been a mystery all along;
keep him that way. He'll be seen only over video--in a mask. Prof. you
supply body; Mike, you supply voice."
Prof shook head. "I can think of no surer way to destroy confidence
at our most critical period than by having a leader who wears a mask. No,
Mannie."
We talked about finding an actor to play it. Were no professional
actors in Luna then but were good amateurs in Luna Civic Players and in
Novy Bolshoi Teatr Associates.

"No," said Prof, "aside from finding an actor of requisite
character--one who would not decide to be Napoleon--we can't wait. Adam
must start handling things not later than tomorrow morning."
"In that case," I said, "you've answered it. Have to use Mike and
never put him on video. Radio only. Have to figure excuse but Adam must
never be seen."
"I'm forced to agree," said Prof.
"Man my oldest friend," said Mike, "why do you say that I can't be
seen?"
"Haven't you listened?" I said. "Mike, we have to show a face and
body on video. You have a body--but it's several tons of metal. A face
you don't have--lucky you, don't have to shave."
"But what's to keep me from showing a face, Man? I'm showing a
voice this instant. But there's no sound behind it. I can show a face the
same way."
Was so taken aback I didn't answer. I stared at video screen,
installed when we leased that room. A pulse is a pulse is a pulse.
Electrons chasing each other. To Mike, whole world was variable series of
electrical pulses, sent or received or chasing around his innards.
I said, "No, Mike."
"Why not, Man?"
"Because you can't! Voice you handle beautifully. Involves only a
few thousand decisions a second, a slow crawl to you. But to build up
video picture would require, uh, say ten million decisions every second.
Mike, you're so fast I can't even think about it. But you aren't that
fast."
Mike said softly, "Want to bet, Man?"
Wyoh said indignantly, "Of course Mike can if he says he can!
Mannie, you shouldn't talk that way." (Wyoh thinks an electron is
something about size and shape of a small pea.)
"Mike," I said slowly, "I won't put money on it. Okay, want to try?
Shall I switch on video?"
"I can switch it on," he answered.
"Sure you'll get right one? Wouldn't do to have this show somewhere
else."
He answered testily, "I'm not stupid. Now let me be, Man--for I
admit this is going to take just about all I've got."
We waited in silence. Then screen showed neutral gray with a hint
of scan lines. Went black again, then a faint light filled middle and
congealed into cloudy areas light and dark, ellipsoid. Not a face, but
suggestion of face that one sees in cloud patterns covering Terra.
It cleared a little and reminded me of pictures alleged to be
ectoplasm. A ghost of a face.
Suddenly firmed and we saw "Adam Selene."
Was a still picture of a mature man. No background, just a face as
if trimmed out of a print. Yet was, to me, "Adam Selene." Could not he
anybody else.
Then he smiled, moving lips and jaw and touching tongue to lips, a
quick gesture--and I was frightened.
"How do I look?" he asked.
"Adam," said Wyoh, "your hair isn't that curly. And it should go
back on each side above your forehead. You look as if you were wearing a
wig, dear."
Mike corrected it. "Is that better?'

"Not quite so much. And don't you have dimples? I was sure I could
hear dimples when you chuckle. Like Prof's."
Mike-Adam smiled again; this time he had dimples. "How should I be
dressed, Wyoh?"
"Are you at your office?"
"I'm still at office. Have to be, tonight." Background turned gray,
then came into focus and color. A wall calendar behind him gave date,
Tuesday 19 May 2076; a clock showed correct time. Near his elbow was a
carton of coffee. On desk was a solid picture, a family group, two men, a
woman, four children. Was background noise, muted roar of Old Dome Plaza
louder than usual; I heard shouts and in distance some singing: Simon's
version of "Marseillaise."
Off screen Ginwallah's voice said, "Gospodin?"
Adam turned toward it. "I'm busy, Albert," he said patiently. "No
calls from anyone but cell B. You handle everything else." He looked back
at us. "Well, Wyoh? Suggestions? Prof? Man my doubting friend? Will I
pass?"
I rubbed eyes. "Mike, can you cook?"
"Certainly. But I don't; I'm married."
"Adam," said Wyoh, "how can you look so neat after the day we've
had?"
"I don't let little things worry me." He looked at Prof.
"Professor, if the picture is okay, let's discuss what I'll say tomorrow.
I was thinking of pre-empting the eight hundred newscast, have it
announced all night, and pass the word down the cells."
We talked rest of night. I sent up for coffee twice and Mike-Adam
had his carton renewed. When I ordered sandwiches, he asked Ginwallah to
send out for some. I caught a glimpse of Albert Ginwallah in profile, a
typical babu, polite and faintly scornful. Hadn't known what he looked
like. Mike ate while we ate, sometimes mumbling around a mouthful of
food.
When I asked (professional interest) Mike told me that, after he
had picture built up, he had programmed most of it for automatic and gave
his attention just to facial expressions. But soon I forgot it was fake.
Mike-Adam was talking with us by video, was all, much more convenient
than by phone.
By oh-three-hundred we had policy settled, then Mike rehearsed
speech. Prof found points be wanted to add; Mike made revisions, then we
decided to get some rest, even Mike-Adam was yawning--although in fact
Mike held fort all through night, guarding transmissions to Terra,
keeping Complex wailed off, listening at many phones. Prof and I shared
big bed, Wyoh stretched out on couch, I whistled lights out. For once we
slept without weights.
While we had breakfast, Adam Selene addressed Free Luna.
He was gentle, strong, warm, and persuasive. "Citizens of Free
Luna, friends, comrades--to those of you who do not know me let me
introduce myself. I am Adam Selene. Chairman of the Emergency Committee
of Comrades for Free Luna... now of Free Luna, we are free at last. The
so-called 'Authority' which has long usurped power in this our home has
been overthrown. I find myself temporary head of such government as we
have--the Emergency Committee.
"Shortly, as quickly as can be arranged, you will opt your own
government." Adam smiled and made a gesture inviting help. "In the
meantime, with your help, I shall do my best. We will make mistakes--be

tolerant. Comrades, if you have not revealed yourselves to friends and
neighbors, it is time you did so. Citizens, requests may reach you
through your comrade neighbors. I hope you will comply willingly; it will
speed the day when I can bow out and life can get back to normal--a new
normal, free of the Authority, free of guards, free of troops stationed
on us, free of passports and searches and arbitrary arrests.
"There has to be a transition. To all of you--please go back to
work, resume normal lives. To those who worked for the Authority, the
need is the same. Go back to work. Wages will go on, your jobs stay the
same, until we can decide what is needed, what happily no longer is
needed now that we are free, and what must be kept but modified. You new
citizens, transportees sweating out sentences pronounced on you
Earthside--you are free, your sentences are finished! But in the meantime
I hope that you will go on working. You are not required to--the days of
coercion are gone--but you are urged to. You are of course free to leave
the Complex, free to go anywhere... and capsule service to and from the
Complex will resume at once. But before you use your new freedom to rush
into town, let me remind you: 'There is no such thing as a free lunch.'
You are better off for the time being where you are; the food may not be
fancy but will continue hot and on time.
"To take on temporarily those necessary functions of the defunct
Authority I have asked the General Manager of LuNoHo Company to serve.
This company will provide temporary supervision and will start analyzing
how to do away with the tyrannical parts of the Authority and how to
transfer the useful parts to private hands. So please help them.
"To you citizens of Terran nations among us, scientists and
travelers and others, greetings! You are witnessing a rare event, the
birth of a nation. Birth means blood and pain; there has been some. We
hope it is over. You will not be inconvenienced unnecessarily and your
passage home will be arranged as soon as possible. Conversely, you are
welcome to stay, still more welcome to become citizens. But for the
present I urge you to stay out of the corridors, avoid incidents that
might lead to unnecessary blood, unnecessary pain. Be patient with us and
I urge my fellow citizens to be patient with you. Scientists from Terra,
at the Observatory and elsewhere, go on with your work and ignore us.
Then you won't even notice that we are going through the pangs of
creating a new nation. One thing--I am sorry to say that we are
temporarily interfering with your right to communicate with Earthside.
This we do from necessity; censorship will be lifted as quickly as
possible--we hate it as much as you do."
Adam added one more request: "Don't try to see me, comrades, and
phone me only if you must; all others, write if you need to, your letters
will receive prompt attention. But I am not twins, I got no sleep last
night and can't expect much tonight. I can't address meetings, can't
shake hands, can't meet delegations; I must stick to this desk and work-so that I can get rid of this job and turn it over to your choice." He
grinned at them. "Expect me to be as hard to see as Simon Jester!"
It was a fifteen-minute cast but that was essence: Go back to work,
be patient, give us time.
Those scientists gave us almost no time--I should have guessed; was
my sort of pidgin.
All communication Earthside channeled through Mike. But those brain
boys had enough electronic equipment to stock a warehouse; once they

decided to, it took them only hours to breadboard a rig that could reach
Terra.
Only thing that saved us was a fellow traveler who thought Luna
should be free. He tried to phone Adam Selene, wound up talking to one of
a squad of women we had co-opted from C and D level--a system thrown
together in self-defense as, despite Mike's request, half of Luna tried
to phone Adam Selene after that videocast, everything from requests and
demands to busybodies who wanted to tell Adam how to do his job.
After about a hundred calls got routed to me through too much zeal
by a comrade in phone company, we set up this buffer squad. Happily,
comrade lady who took this call recognized that soothe-'em-down doctrine
did not apply; she phoned me.
Minutes later myself and Finn Nielsen plus some eager guns headed
by capsule for laboratory area. Our informant was scared to give name but
had told me where to find transmitter. We caught them transmitting, and
only fast action on Finn's part kept them breathing; his boys were itchy.
But we did not want to "make an example"; Finn and I had settled that on
way out. Is hard to frighten scientists, their minds don't work that way.
Have to get at them from other angles.
I kicked that transmitter to pieces and ordered Director to have
everyone assemble in mess hall and required roll call--where a phone
could hear. Then I talked to Mike, got names from him, and said to
Director: "Doctor, you told me they were all here. We're missing so-andso"--seven names. "Get them here!"
Missing Terrans had been notified, had refused to stop what they
were doing--typical scientists.
Then I talked, Loonies on one side of room, Terrans on other. To
Terrans I said; "We tried to treat you as guests. But three of you tried
and perhaps succeeded in sending message Earthside."
I turned to Director. "Doctor, I could search--warren, surface
structures, all labs, every space--and destroy everything that might be
used for transmitter. I'm electron pusher by trade; I know what wide
variety of components can be converted into transmitters. Suppose I
destroy everything that might be useful for that and, being stupid, take
no chance and smash anything I don't understand. What result?"
Would have thought I was about to kill his baby! He turned gray.
"That would stop every research... destroy priceless data.., waste, oh, I
don't know how much! Call it a half billion dollars!"
"So I thought. Could take all that gear instead of smashing and let
you go on best you can."
"That would be almost as bad. You must understand, Gospodin, that
when an experiment is interrupted--"
"I know. Easier than moving anything--and maybe missing some--is to
take you all to Complex and quarter you there. We have what used to be
Dragoon barracks. But that too would ruin experiments. Besides--Where you
from, Doctor?"
"Princeton, New Jersey."
"So? You've been here five months and no doubt exercising and
wearing weights. Doctor, if we did that, you might never see Princeton
again. If we move you, we'll keep you locked up. You'll get soft. If
emergency goes on very long, you'll be a Loonie like it or not. And all
your brainy help with you."
A cocky chum stepped forward--one who had to be sent for twice.
"You can't do this! It's against the law!"

"What law, Gospodin? Some law back in your hometown?" I turned.
"Finn, show him law."
Finn stepped forward and placed emission bell of gun at man's belly
button. Thumb started to press down--safety-switched, I could see. I
said, "Don't kill him, Finn!"--then went on: "I will eliminate this man
if that's what it takes to convince you. So watch each other! One more
offense will kill all your chances of seeing home again--as well as
ruining researches. Doctor, I warn you to find ways to keep check on your
staff."
I turned to Loonies. "Tovarishchee, keep them honest. Work up own
guard system. Don't take nonsense; every earthworm is on probation. If
you have to eliminate some, don't hesitate. " I turned to Director.
"Doctor, any Loonie can go anywhere any time--even your bedroom. Your
assistants are now your bosses so far as security is concerned; if a
Loonie decides to follow you or anybody into a W. C., don't argue; he
might be jumpy."
I turned to Loonies. "Security first! You each work for some
earthworm--watch him! Split it among you and don't miss anything. Watch
'em so close they can't build mouse trap, much less transmitter. If
interferes with work for them, don't worry; wages will go on."
Could see grins. Lab assistant was best job a Loonie could find
those days--but they worked under earthworms who looked down on us, even
ones who pretended and were oh so gracious.
I let it go at that. When I had been phoned, I had intended to
eliminate offenders. But Prof and Mike set me straight: Plan did not
permit violence against Terrans that could be avoided.
We set up "ears," wideband sensitive receivers, around lab area,
since even most directional rig spills a little in neighborhood. And Mike
listened on all phones in area, After that we chewed nails and hoped.
Presently we relaxed as news up from Earthside showed nothing, they
seemed to accept censored transmissions without suspicion, and private
and commercial traffic and Authority's transmissions all seemed routine.
Meanwhile we worked, trying in days what should take months.
We received one break in timing; no passenger ship was on Luna and
none was due until 7 July. We could have coped--suckered a ship's
officers to "dine with Warden" or something, then mounted guard on its
senders or dismantled them. Could not have lifted without our help; in
those days one drain on ice was providing water for reaction mass. Was
not much drain compared with grain shipments; one manned ship a month was
heavy traffic then, while grain lifted every day. What it did mean was
that an incoming ship was not an insuperable hazard. Nevertheless was
lucky break; we were trying so hard to make everything look normal until
we could defend ourselves.
Grain shipments went on as before; one was catapulted almost as
Finn's men were breaking into Warden's residence. And next went out on
time, and all others.
Neither oversight nor faking for interim; Prof knew what he was
doing. Grain shipments were a big operation (for a little country like
Luna) and couldn't be changed in one semi-lunar; bread-and-beer of too
many people was involved. If our committee had ordered embargo and quit
buying grain, we would have been chucked out and a new committee with
other ideas would have taken over.
Prof said that an educational period was necessary. Meanwhile grain
barges catapulted as usual; LuNoHoCo kept books and issued receipts,

using civil service personnel. Dispatches went out in Warden's name and
Mike talked to Authority Earthside, using Warden's voice. Deputy
Administrator proved reasonable, once he understood it upped his life
expectancy. Chief Engineer stayed on job, too--McIntyre was a real
Loonie, given chance, rather than fink by nature. Other department heads
and minor stooges were no problem; life went on as before and we were too
busy to unwind Authority system and put useful parts up for sale.
Over a dozen people turned up claiming to be Simon Jester; Simon
wrote a rude verse disclaiming them and had picture on front page of
Lunatic, Pravda, and Gong. Wyoh let herself go blond and made trip to see
Greg at new catapult site, then a longer trip, ten days, to old home in
Hong Kong Luna, taking Anna who wanted to see it. Wyoh needed a vacation
and Prof urged her to take it, pointing on that she was in touch by phone
and that closer Party contact was needed in Hong Kong. I took over her
stilyagi with Slim and Hazel as my lieutenants--bright, sharp kids I
could trust. Slim was awed to discover that I was "Comrade Bork" and saw
"Adam Selene" every day; his Party name started with "G." Made a good
team for other reason, too. Hazel suddenly started showing cushiony
curves and not all from Mimi's superb table; she had reached that point
in her orbit. Slim was ready to change her name to "Stone" any time she
was willing to opt. In meantime he was anxious to do Party work he could
share with our fierce little redhead.
Not everybody was willing. Many comrades turned out to be talk-talk
soldiers. Still more thought war was over once we had eliminated Peace
Goons and captured Warden. Others were indignant to learn how far down
they were in Party structure; they wanted to elect a new structure,
themselves at top. Adam received endless calls proposing this or
something like it--would listen, agree, assure them that their services
must not be wasted by waiting for election--and refer them to Prof or me.
Can't recall any of these ambitious people who amounted to anything when
I tried to put them to work.
Was endless work and nobody wanted to do it. Well, a few. Some best
volunteers were people Party had never located. But in general, Loonies
in and out of Party had no interest in "patriotic" work unless well paid.
One chum who claimed to be a Party member (was not) spragged me in
Raffles where we set up headquarters and wanted me to contract for fifty
thousand buttons to be worn by pre-coup "Veterans of Revolution"--a
"small" profit for him (I estimate 400 percent markup), easy dollars for
me, a fine thing for everybody.
When I brushed him off, he threatened to denounce me to Adam
Selene--"A very good friend of mine, I'll have you know!"--for sabotage.
That was "help" we got. What we needed was something else. Needed
steel at new catapult and plenty--Prof asked, if really necessary to put
steel around rock missiles; I had to point out that an induction field
won't grab bare rock. We needed to relocate Mike's ballistic radars at
old site and install doppler radar at new site--both jobs because we
could expect attacks from space at old site.
We called for volunteers, got only two who could be used--and
needed several hundred mechanics who did not mind hard work in p-suits.
So we hired, paying what we had to---LuNoHoCo went in hock to Bank of
Hong Kong Luna; was no time to steal that much and most funds had been
transferred Earthside to Stu. A dinkum comrade, Foo Moses Morris, cosigned much paper to keep us going--and wound up broke and started over
with a little tailoring shop in Kongville. That was later.

Authority Scrip dropped from 3-to-1 to 17-to-1 after coup and civil
service people screamed, as Mike was still paying in Authority checks. We
said they could stay on or resign; then those we needed, we rehired with
Hong Kong dollars. But created a large group not on our side from then
on; they longed for good old days and were ready to stab new regime.
Grain farmers and brokers were unhappy because payment at catapult
head continued to be Authority scrip at same old fixed prices. "We won't
take it!" they cried--and LuNoHoCo man would shrug and tell them they
didn't have to but this grain still went to Authority Earthside (it did)
and Authority scrip was all they would get. So take cheque, or load your
grain back into rolligons and get it out of here.
Most took it. All grumbled and some threatened to get out of grain
and start growing vegetables or fibers or something that brought Hong
Kong dollars--and Prof smiled.
We needed every drillman in Luna, especially ice miners who owned
heavy-duty laser drills. As soldiers. We needed them so badly that,
despite being shy one wing and rusty, I considered joining up, even
though takes muscle to wrestle a big drill, and prosthetic just isn't
muscle. Prof told me not to be a fool.
Dodge we had in mind would not work well Earthside; a laser beam
carrying heavy power works best in vacuum--but there it works just dandy
for whatever range its collimation is good for. These big drills, which
had carved through rock seeking pockets of ice, were now being mounted as
"artillery" to repel space attacks. Both ships and missiles have
electronic nervous systems and does electronic gear no good to blast it
with umpteen joules placed in a tight beam. If target is pressured (as
manned ships are and most missiles), all it takes is to burn a hole,
depressure it. If not pressured, a heavy laser beam can still kill it-burn eyes, louse guidance, spoil anything depending on electronics as
most everything does.
An H-bomb with circuitry ruined is not a bomb, is just big tub of
lithium deuteride that can't do anything but crash. A ship with eyes gone
is a derelict, not a warship.
Sounds easy, is not. Those laser drills were never meant for
targets a thousand kilometers away, or even one, and was no quick way to
rig their cradles for accuracy. Gunner had to have guts to hold fire
until last few seconds--on a target heading at him maybe two kilometers
per second. But was best we had, so we organized First and Second
Volunteer Defense Gunners of Free Luna--two regiments so that First could
snub lowly Second and Second could be Jealous of First. First got older
men, Second got young and eager.
Having called them "volunteers," we hired in Hong Kong dollars--and
was no accident that ice was being paid for in controlled market in
wastepaper Authority script.
On top of all, we were talking up a war scare. Adam Selene talked
over video, reminding that Authority was certain to try to regain its
tyranny and we had only days to prepare; papers quoted him and published
stories of their own--we had made special effort to recruit newsmen
before coup. People were urged to keep p-suits always near and to test
pressure alarms in homes. A volunteer Civil Defense Corps was organized
in each warren.
What with moonquakes always with us, each warren's pressure co-op
always had sealing crews ready at any hour. Even with silicone stay-soft
and fiberglass any warren leaks. In Davis Tunnels our boys did

maintenance on seal every day. But now we recruited hundreds of emergency
sealing crews, mostly stilyagi, drilled them with fake emergencies, had
them stay in p-suits with helmets open when on duty.
They did beautifully. But idiots made fun of them--"play soldiers,"
"Adam's little apples," other names. A team was going through a
drill, showing they could throw a temporary lock around one that had been
damaged, and one of these pinheads stood by and rode them loudly.
Civil Defense team went ahead, completed temporary lock, tested it
with helmets closed; it held--came out, grabbed this joker, took him
through into temporary lock and on out into zero pressure, dumped him.
Belittlers kept opinions to selves after that. Prof thought we
ought to send out a gentle warning not to eliminate so peremptorily. I
opposed it and got my way; could see no better way to improve breed.
Certain types of loudmouthism should be a capital offense among decent
people.
But our biggest headaches were self-anointed statesmen.
Did I say that Loonies are "non-political"? They are, when comes to
doing anything. But doubt if was ever a time two Loonies over a liter of
beer did not swap loud opinions about how things ought to be run.
As mentioned, these self-appointed political scientists tried to
grab Adam Selene's ear. But Prof had a place for them; each was invited
to take part in "Ad-Hoc Congress for Organization of Free Luna"--which
met in Community Hall in Luna City, then resolved to stay in session
until work was done, a week in L-City, a week in Novylen, then Hong Kong,
and start over. All sessions were in video. Prof presided over first and
Adam Selene addressed them by video and encouraged them to do a thorough
job--"History is watching you."
I listened to some sessions, then cornered Prof and asked what in
Bog's name he was up to? "Thought you didn't want any government. Have
you heard those nuts since you turned them loose?"
He smiled most dimply smile. "What's troubling you, Manuel?"
Many things were troubling me. With me breaking heart trying to
round up heavy drills and men who could treat them as guns these idlers
had spent an entire afternoon discussing immigration. Some wanted to stop
it entirely. Some wanted to tax it, high enough to finance government
(when ninety-nine out of a hundred Loonies had had to be dragged to The
Rock!); some wanted to make it selective by "ethnic ratios." (Wondered
how they would count me?) Some wanted to limit it to females until we
were 50-50. That had produced a Scandinavian shout: "Ja, cobber! Tell 'em
send us hoors! Tousands and tousands of hoors! I marry 'em, I betcha!"
Was most sensible remark all afternoon.
Another time they argued "time. " Sure, Greenwich time bears no
relation to lunar. But why should it when we live Underground? Show me a
Loonie who can sleep two weeks and work two weeks; lunars don't fit our
metabolism. What was urged was to make a lunar exactly equal to twentyeight days (instead of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2 .78 seconds) and
do this by making days longer--and hours, minutes, and seconds, thus
making each semi-lunar exactly two weeks.
Sure, lunar is necessary for many purposes. Controls when we go up
on surface, why we go, and how long we stay. But, aside from throwing us
out of gear with our only neighbor, had that wordy vacuum skull thought
what this would do to every critical figure in science and engineering?
As an electronics man I shuddered. Throw away every book, table,
instrument, and start over? I know that some of my ancestors did that in

switching from old English units to MKS--but they did it to make things
easier. Fourteen inches to a foot and some odd number of feet to a mile.
Ounces and pounds. Oh, Bog!
Made sense to change that--but why go out of your way to create
confusion?
Somebody wanted a committee to determine exactly what Loonie
language is, then fine everybody who talked Earthside English or other
language. Oh, my people!
I read tax proposals in Lunatic--four sorts of "SingleTaxers"--a
cubic tax that would penalize a man if he extended tunnels, a head tax
(everybody pay same), income tax (like to see anyone figure income of
Davis Family or try to get information out of Mum!), and an "air tax"
which was not fees we paid then but something else.
Hadn't realized "Free Luna" was going to have taxes. Hadn't had any
before and got along. You paid for what you got. Tanstaafl. How else?
Another time some pompous choom proposed that bad breath and body
odors be made an elimination offense. Could almost sympathize, having
been stuck on occasion in a capsule with such stinks. But doesn't happen
often and tends to be self-correcting; chronic offenders, or unfortunates
who can't correct, aren't likely to reproduce, seeing how choosy women
are.
One female (most were men, but women made up for it in silliness)
had a long list she wanted made permanent laws--about private matters. No
more plural marriage of any sort. No divorces. No "fornication"--had to
look that one up. No drinks stronger than 4% beer. Church services only
on Saturdays and all else to stop that day. (Air and temperature and
pressure engineering, lady? Phones and capsules?) A long list of drugs to
be prohibited and a shorter list dispensed only by licensed physicians.
(What is a "licensed physician"? Healer I go to has a sign reading
"practical doctor"--makes book on side, which is why I go to him. Look,
lady, aren't any medical schools in Luna!) (Then, I mean.) She even
wanted to make gambling illegal. If a Loonie couldn't roll double or
nothing, he would go to a shop that would, even if dice were loaded.
Thing that got me was not her list of things she hated, since she
was obviously crazy as a Cyborg, but fact that always somebody agreed
with her prohibitions. Must be a yearning deep in human heart to stop
other people from doing as they please. Rules, laws--always for other
fellow. A murky part of us, something we had before we came down out of
trees, and failed to shuck when we stood up. Because not one of those
people said: "Please pass this so that I won't be able to do something I
know I should stop." Nyet, tovarishchee, was always something they hated
to see neighbors doing. Stop them "for their own good"--not because
speaker claimed to be harmed by it.
Listening to that session I was almost sorry we got rid of Mort the
Wart. He stayed holed up with his women and didn't tell us how to run
private lives.
But Prof didn't get excited; he went on smiling. "Manuel, do you
really think that mob of retarded children can pass any laws?"
"You told them to. Urged them to."
"My dear Manuel, I was simply putting all my nuts in one basket. I
know those nuts; I've listened to them for years. I was very careful in
selecting their committees; they all have built-in confusion, they will
quarrel. The chairman I forced on them while letting them elect him is a
ditherer who could not unravel a piece of string--thinks every subject

needs 'more study.' I almost needn't have bothered; more than six people
cannot agree on anything, three is better--and one is perfect for a job
that one can do. This is why parliamentary bodies all through history,
when they accomplished anything, owed it to a few strong men who
dominated the rest. Never fear, son, this Ad-Hoc Congress will do
nothing... or if they pass something through sheer fatigue, it will be so
loaded with contradictions that it will have to be thrown out. In the
meantime they are out of our hair. Besides, there is something we need
them for, later."
"Thought you said they could do nothing."
"They won't do this. One man will write it--a dead man--and late at
night when they are very tired, they'll pass it by acclamation."
"Who's this dead man? You don't mean Mike?"
"No, no! Mike is far more alive than those yammerheads. The dead
man is Thomas Jefferson--first of the rational anarchists, my boy, and
one who once almost managed to slip over his non-system through the most
beautiful rhetoric ever written. But they caught him at it, which I hope
to avoid. I cannot improve on his phrasing; I shall merely adapt it to
Luna and the twenty-first century."
"Heard of him, Freed slaves, nyet?"
"One might say he tried but failed. Never mind. How are the
defenses progressing? I don't see how we can keep up the pretense past
the arrival date of this next ship."
"Can't be ready then."
"Mike says we must be."
We weren't but ship never arrived. Those scientists outsmarted me
and Loonies I had told to watch them. Was a rig at focal point of biggest
reflector and Loonie assistants believed doubletalk about astronomical
purpose--a new wrinkle in radiotelescopes.
I suppose it was. Was ultramicrowave and stuff was bounced at
reflector by a wave guide and thus left scope lined up nicely by mirror.
Remarkably like early radar. And metal latticework and foil heat shield
of barrel stopped stray radiation, thus "ears" I had staked out heard
nothing.
They put message across, their version and in detail. First we
heard was demand from Authority to Warden to deny this hoax, find hoaxer,
put stop to it.
So instead we gave them a Declaration of Independence.
"In Congress assembled, July Fourth, Twenty-Seventy-Six--"
Was beautiful.

15
Signing of Declaration of Independence went as Prof said it would. He
sprang it on them at end of long day, announced a special session after
dinner at which Adam Selene would speak. Adam read aloud, discussing each
sentence, then read it without stopping, making music of sonorous
phrases. People wept. Wyoh, seated by me, was one, and I felt like it
even though had read it earlier.

Then Adam looked at them and said, "The future is waiting. Mark
well what you do," and turned meeting over to Prof rather than usual
chairman.
Was twenty-two hundred and fight began. Sure, they were in favor of
it; news all day had been jammed with what bad boys we were, how we were
to be punished, taught a lesson, so forth. Not necessary to spice it up;
stuff up from Earthside was nasty--Mike merely left out on-other-hand
opinions. If ever was a day when Luna felt unified it was probably second
of July 2076.
So they were going to pass it; Prof knew that before he offered it.
But not as written--"Honorable Chairman, in second paragraph, that
word 'unalienable,' is no such word; should be 'inalienable'--and anyhow
wouldn't it be more dignified to say 'sacred rights' rather than
'inalienable rights'? I'd like to hear discussion on this."
That choom was almost sensible, merely a literary critic, which is
harmless, like dead yeast left in beer. But--Well, take that woman who
hated everything. She was there with list; read it aloud and moved to
have it incorporated into Declaration "so that the peoples of Terra will
know that we are civilized and fit to take our places in the councils of
mankind!"
Prof not only let her get away with it; he encouraged her, letting
her talk when other people wanted to--then blandly put her proposal to a
vote when hadn't even been seconded. (Congress operated by rules they had
wrangled over for days. Prof was familiar with rules but followed them
only as suited him.) She was voted down in a shout, and left.
Then somebody stood up and said of course that long list didn't
belong in Declaration--but shouldn't we have general principles? Maybe a
statement that Luna Free State guaranteed freedom, equality, and security
to all? Nothing elaborate, just those fundamental principles that
everybody knew was proper purpose of government.
True enough and let's pass it--but must read "Freedom, equality,
peace, and security"--right, Comrade? They wrangled over whether
"freedom" included "free air," or was that part of "security"? Why not be
on safe side and list "free air" by name? Move to amend to make it "free
air and water"--because you didn't have "freedom" or "security" unless
you had both air and water.
Air, water, and food.
Air, water, food, and cubic.
Air, water, food, cubic, and heat.
No, make "heat" read "power" and you had it all covered.
Everything.
Cobber, have you lost your mind? That's far from everything and
what you've left out is an affront to all womankind--Step outside and say
that! Let me finish. We've got to tell them right from deal that we will
permit no more ships to land unless they carry at least as many women as
men. At least, I said--and I for one won't chop it unless it sets
immigration issue straight.
Prof never lost dimples.
Began to see why Prof had slept all day and was not wearing
weights. Me, I was tired, having spent all day in p-suit out beyond
catapult head cutting in last of relocated ballistic radars. And
everybody was tired; by midnight crowd began to thin, convinced that
nothing would be accomplished that night and bored by any yammer not
their own.

Was later than midnight when someone asked why this Declaration was
dated fourth when today was second? Prof said mildly that it was July
third now--and it seemed unlikely that our Declaration could be announced
earlier than fourth and that July fourth carried historical symbolism
that might help.
Several people walked out at announcement that probably nothing
would be settled until fourth of July. But I began to notice something:
Hall was filling as fast as was emptying. Finn Nielsen slid into a seat
that had just been vacated. Comrade Clayton from Hong Kong showed up,
pressed my shoulder, smiled at Wyoh, found a seat. My youngest
lieutenants. Slim and Hazel, I spotted down front--and was thinking I
must alibi Hazel by telling Mum I had kept her out on Parts business-when was amused to see Mum herself next to them. And Sidris. And Greg,
who was supposed to be at new catapult.
Looked around and picked out a dozen more--night editor of Lunaya
Pravda, General Manager of LuNoHoCo, others, and each one a working
comrade, Began to see that Prof had stacked deck. That Congress never had
a fixed membership; these dinkum comrades had as much right to show up as
those who had been talking a month. Now they sat--and voted down
amendments.
About three hundred, when I was wondering how much more I could
take, someone brought a note to Prof. He read it, banged gavel and said,
"Adam Selene begs your indulgence. Do I hear unanimous consent?"
So screen back of rostrum lighted up again and Adam told them that
he had been following debate and was warmed by many thoughtful and
constructive criticisms. But could he made a suggestion? Why not admit
that any piece of writing was imperfect? If thin declaration was in
general what they wanted, why not postpone perfection for another day and
pass this as it stands? "Honorable Chairman, I so move."
They passed it with a yell. Prof said, "Do I hear objection?" and
waited with gavel raised. A man who had been talking when Adam had asked
to be heard said, "Well,.. I still say that's a dangling participle, but
okay, leave it in."
Prof hanged gavel. "So ordered!"
Then we filed up and put our chops on a big scroll that had been
"sent over from Adam's office"---and I noticed Adam's chop on it. I
signed right under Hazel--child now could write although was still short
on book learning. Her chop was shaky but she wrote it large and proud.
Comrade Clayton signed his Party name, real name in letters, and Japanese
chop, three little pictures one above other. Two comrades chopped with
X's and had them witnessed. All Party leaders were there that night
(morning), all chopped it, and not more than a dozen yammerers stuck. But
those who did, put their chops down for history to read. And thereby
committed "their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors."
While queue was moving slowly past and people were talking, Prof
banged for attention. "I ask for volunteers for a dangerous mission. This
Declaration will go on the news channels--but must be presented in person
to the Federated Nations, on Terra."
That put stop to noise. Prof was looking at me. I swallowed and
said, "I volunteer." Wyoh echoed, "So do I!"--and little Hazel Meade
said, "Me, too!"
In moments were a dozen, from Finn Nielsen to Gospodin DanglingParticiple (turned out to be good cobber aside from his fetish). Prof

took names, murmured something about getting in touch as transportation
became available.
I got Prof aside and said, "Look, Prof, you too tired to track? You
know ship for seventh was canceled; now they're talking about slapping
embargo on us. Next ship they lift for Luna will be a warship. How you
planning to travel? As prisoner?"
"Oh, we won't use their ships."
"So? Going to build one? Any idea how long that takes? If could
build one at all. Which I doubt."
"Manuel, Mike says it's necessary--and has it all worked out."
I did know Mike said was necessary; he had rerun problem soon as we
learned that bright laddies at Richardson had snuck one home--he now gave
us only one chance in fifty-three... with imperative need for Prof to go
Earthside. But I'm not one to worry about impossibilities; I had spent
day working to make that one chance in fifty-three turn up.
"Mike will provide the ship," Prof went on. "He has completed its
design and it is being worked on."
"He has? It is? Since when is Mike engineer?"
"Isn't he?" asked Prof.
I started to answer, shut up. Mike had no degrees. Simply knew more
engineering than any man alive. Or about Shakespeare's plays, or riddles,
or history, name it. "Tell me more."
"Manuel, we'll go to Terra as a load of grain."
"What? Who's 'we'?"
"You and myself. The other volunteers are merely decorative."
I said, "Look, Prof. I've stuck. Worked hard when whole thing
seemed silly. Worn these weights--got 'em on now--on chance I might have
to go to that dreadful place. But contracted to go in a ship, with at
least a Cyborg pilot to help me get down safely. Did not agree to go as
meteorite."
He said, "Very well, Manuel. I believe in free choice, always. Your
alternate will go."
"My--Who?"
"Comrade Wyoming. So far as I know she is the only other person in
training for the trip... other than a few Terrans."
So I went. But talked to Mike first. He said patiently. "Man my
first friend, there isn't a thing to worry about. You are scheduled load
KM187 series '76 and you'll arrive in Bombay with no trouble. But to be
sure--to reassure you--I selected that barge because it will be taken out
of parking orbit and landed when India is faced toward me, and I've added
an override so that I can take you away from ground control if I don't
like the way they handle you. Trust me, Man, it has all been thought
through. Even the decision to continue shipments when security was broken
was part of this plan."
"Might have told me."
"There was no need to worry you. Professor had to know and I've
kept in touch with him. But you are going simply to take care of him and
back him up--do his job if he dies, a factor on which I can give you no
reassurance."
I sighed. "Okay. But, Mike, surely you don't think you can pilot a
barge into a soft landing at this distance? Speed of light alone would
trip you."
"Man, don't you think I understand ballistics? For the orbital
position then, from query through reply and then to command-received is

under four seconds... and you can rely on me not to waste microseconds.
Your maximum parking-orbit travel in four seconds is only thirty-two
kilometers, diminishing asymptotically to zero at landing. My reflex time
will be effectively less than that of a pilot in a manual landing because
I don't waste time grasping a situation and deciding on correct action.
So my maximum is four seconds. But my effective reflex time is much less,
as I project and predict constantly, see ahead, program it out--in
effect, I'll stay four seconds ahead of you in your trajectory and
respond instantly."
"That steel can doesn't even have an altimeter!"
"It does now. Man, please believe me; I've thought of everything.
The only reason I've ordered this extra equipment is to reassure you.
Poona ground control hasn't made a bobble in the last five thousand
loads. For a computer it's fairly bright."
"Okay. Uh, Mike, how hard do they splash those bleeding barges?
What gee?"
"Not high, Man. Ten gravities at injection, then that programs down
to a steady, soft four gees... then you'll be nudged again between six
and five gees just before splash. The splash itself is gentle, equal to a
fall of fifty meters and you enter ogive first with no sudden shock, less
than three gees. Then you surface and splash again, lightly, and simply
float at one gee. Man, those barge shells are built as lightly as
possible for economy's sake. We can't afford to toss them around or they
would split their seams."
"How sweet. Mike, what would 'six to five gees' do to you? Split
your seams?"
"I conjecture that I was subjected to about six gravities when they
shipped me up here. Six gravities in my present condition would shear
many of my essential connections. However, I'm more interested in the
extremely high, transient accelerations I am going to experience from
shock waves when Terra starts bombing us. Data are insufficient for
prediction but I may lose control of my outlying functions, Man. This
could be a major factor in any tactical situation."
"Mike, you really think they are going to bomb us?"
"Count on it, Man. That is why this trip is so important."
Left it at that and went out to see this coffin. Should have stayed
home.
Ever looked at one of those silly barges? Just a steel cylinder
with retro and guidance rockets and radar transponder. Resembles a
spaceship way a pair of pliers resembles my number-three arm. They had
this one cut open and were outfitting our "living quarters."
No galley. No W. C. No nothing. Why bother? We were going to be in
it only fifty hours. Start empty so that you won't need a honey sack in
your suit. Dispense with lounge and bar; you'll never be out of your
suit, you'll be drugged and not caring.
At least Prof would be drugged almost whole time; I had to be alert
at landing to try to get us out of this death trap if something went
wrong and nobody came along with a tin opener. They were building a
shaped cradle in which backs of our p-suits would fit; we would be
strapped into these holes. And stay there, clear to Terra. They seemed
more concerned about making total mass equal to displaced wheat and same
center of gravity and all moment arms adding up correctly than they did
about our comfort; engineer in charge told me that even padding to be
added inside our p-suits was figured in.

Was glad to learn we were going to have padding; those holes did
not look soft.
Returned home in thoughtful condition.
Wyoh was not at dinner, unusual; Greg was, more unusual. Nobody
said anything about my being scheduled to imitate a falling rock next day
although all knew. But did not realize anything special was on until all
next generation left table without being told. Then knew why Greg had not
gone back to Mare Undarum site after Congress adjourned that morning;
somebody had asked for a Family talk-talk.
Mum looked around and said, "We're all here. Ali, shut that door;
that's a dear. Grandpaw, will you start us?"
Our senior husband stopped nodding over coffee and firmed up. He
looked down table and said strongly, "I see that we are all here. I see
that children have been put to bed. I see that there is no stranger, no
guest. I say that we are met in accordance with customs created by Black
Jack Davis our First Husband and Tillie our First Wife. If there is any
matter that concerns safety and happiness of our marriage, haul it out in
the light now. Don't let it fester. This is our custom."
Grandpaw turned to Mum and said softly, "Take it, Mimi," and
slumped back into gentle apathy. But for a minute he had been strong,
handsome, virile, dynamic man of days of my opting... and I thought with
sudden tears how lucky I had been!
Then didn't know whether I felt lucky or not. Only excuse I could
see for a Family talk-talk was fact that I was due to be shipped
Earthside next day, labeled as grain. Could Mum be thinking of trying to
set Family against it? Nobody had to abide by results of a talk-talk. But
one always did. That was strength of our marriage: When came down to
issues, we stood together.
Mimi was saying, "Does anyone have anything that needs to be
discussed? Speak up, dears."
Greg said, "I have."
"We'll listen to Greg."
Greg is a good speaker. Can stand up in front of a congregation and
speak with confidence about matters I don't feel confident about even
when alone. But that night he seemed anything but sure of himself. "Well,
uh, we've always tried to keep this marriage in balance, some old, some
young, a regular alternation, well spaced, just as it was handed down to
us. But we've varied sometimes--for good reason." He looked at Ludmilla.
"And adjusted it later." He looked again at far end of table, at Frank
and Ali, on each side of Ludmilla.
"Over years, as you can see from records, average age of husbands
has been about forty, wives about thirty-five--and that age spread was
just what our marriage started with, nearly a hundred years gone by, for
Tillie was fifteen when she opted Black Jack and he had just turned
twenty. Right now I find that average age of husbands is almost exactly
forty, while average--"
Mum said firmly, "Never mind arithmetic, Greg dear. Simply state
it."
I was trying to think who Greg could possibly mean. True, I had
been much away during past year, and if did get home, was often after
everybody was asleep. But he was clearly talking about marriage and
nobody ever proposes another wedding in our marriage without first giving
everybody a long careful chance to look prospect over. You just didn't do
it any other way!

So I'm stupid. Greg stuttered and said, "I propose Wyoming Knott!"
I said I was stupid. I understand machinery and machinery
understands me. But didn't claim to know anything about people. When I
get to be senior husband, if live that long, am going to do exactly what
Grandpaw does with Mum: Let Sidris run it. Just same--Well, look, Wyoh
joined Greg's church. I like Greg, love Greg. And admire him. But you
could never feed theology of his church through a computer and get
anything but null. Wyoh surely knew this, since she encountered it in
adult years--truthfully, I had suspected that Wyoh's conversion was proof
that she would do anything for our Cause.
But Wyoh had recruited Greg even earlier. And had made most of
trips out to new site, easier for her to get away than me or Prof. Oh,
well. Was taken by surprise. Should not have been.
Mimi said, "Greg, do you have reason to think that Wyoming would
accept an opting from us?"
"Yes."
"Very well. We all know Wyoming; I'm sure we've formed our opinions
of her. I see no reason to discuss it... unless someone has something to
say? Speak up."
Was no surprise to Mum. But wouldn't be. Nor to anyone else,
either, since Mum never let a talk-talk take place until she was sure of
outcome.
But wondered why Mum was sure of my opinion, so certain that she
had not felt me out ahead of time? And sat there in a soggy quandary,
knowing I should speak up, knowing I knew something terribly pertinent
which nobody else knew or matter would never have gone this far.
Something that didn't matter to me but would matter to Mum and all our
women.
Sat there, miserable coward, and said nothing, Mum said, "Very
well. Let's call the roll. Ludmilla?"
"Me? Why, I love Wyoh, everybody knows that. Sure!"
"Lenore dear?"
"Well, I may try to talk her into going back to being a brownie
again; I think we set each other off. But that's her only fault, being
blonder than I am. Da!"
"Sidris?"
"Thumbs up. Wyoh is our kind of people."
"Anna?"
"I've something to say before I express my opinion, Mimi.'
"I don't think it's necessary, dear."
"Nevertheless I'm going to haul it out in the open, just as Tillie
always did according to our traditions. In this marriage every wife has
carried her load, given children to the family. It may come as a surprise
to some of you to learn that Wyoh has had eight children--"
Certainly surprised Ali; his head jerked and jaw dropped. I stared
at plate. Oh, Wyoh, Wyoh! How could I let this happen? Was going to have
to speak up.
And realized Anna was still speaking: "--so now she can have
children of her own; the operation was successful. But she worries about
possibility of another defective baby, unlikely as that is according to
the head of the clinic in Hong Kong. So we'll just have to love her
enough to make her quit fretting."
"We will love her," Mum said serenely. "We do love her. Anna, are
you ready to express opinion?"

"Hardly necessary, is it? I went to Hong Kong with her, held her
hand while her tubes were restored. I opt Wyoh."
"In this family," Mum went on, "we have always felt that our
husbands should be allowed a veto. Odd of us perhaps, hut Tillie started
it and it has always worked well. Well, Grandpaw?"
"Eh? What were you saying, my dear?"
"We are opting Wyoming, Gospodin Grandpaw. Do you give consent?"
"What? Why, of course, of course! Very nice little girl. Say,
whatever became of that pretty little Afro, name something like that? She
get mad at us?"
"Greg?"
"I proposed it."
"Manuel? Do you forbid this?"
"Me? Why, you know me, Mum."
"I do. I sometimes wonder if you know you. Hans?"
"What would happen if I said No?"
"You'd lose some teeth, that's what," Lenore said promptly. "Hans
votes Yes."
"Stop it, darlings," Mum said with soft reproof. "Opting is a
serious matter. Hans, speak up."
"Da. Yes. Ja. Oui. Si. High time we had a pretty blonde in this-Ouch!"
"Stop it, Lenore. Frank?"
"Yes, Mum."
"Ali dear? Is it unanimous?"
Lad blushed bright pink and couldn't talk. Nodded vigorously.
Instead of appointing a husband and a wife to seek out selectee and
propose opting for us, Mum sent Ludmilla and Anna to fetch Wyoh at once-and turned out she was only as far away as Bon Ton. Nor was that only
irregularity; instead of setting a date and arranging a wedding party,
our children were called in, and twenty minutes later Greg had his Book
open and we did the taking vows--and I finally got it through my confused
head that was being done with breakneck speed because of my date to break
my neck next day.
Not that it could matter save as symbol of my family's love for me,
since a bride spent her first night with her senior husband, and second
night and third I was going to spend out in space. But did matter anyhow
and when women started to cry during ceremony, I found self dripping
tears right with them.
Then I went to bed, alone in workshop, once Wyoh had kissed us and
left on Grandpaw's arm. Was terribly tired and last two days had been
hard. Thought about exercises and decided was too late to matter; thought
about calling Mike and asking him for news from Terra. Went to bed.
Don't know how long had been asleep when realized was no longer
asleep and somebody was in room. "Manuel?" came soft whisper in dark.
"Huh? Wyoh, you aren't supposed to be here, dear."
"I am indeed supposed to be here, my husband. Mum knows I'm here,
so does Greg. And Grandpaw went right to sleep."
"Oh. What time is?"
"About four hundred. Please, dear, may I come to bed?"
"What? Oh, certainly." Something I should remember. Oh, yes.
"Mike!"
"Yes, Man?" he answered.

"Switch off. Don't listen. If you want me, call me on Family
phone."
"So Wyoh told me, Man. Congratulations!"
Then her head was pillowed on my stump and I put right arm around
her. "What are you crying about, Wyoh?"
"I'm not crying! I'm just frightened silly that you won't come
back!"

16
Woke up scared silly in pitch darkness. "Manuel!" Didn't know which end
was up. "Manuel!" it called again. "Wake up!"
That brought me out some; was signal intended to trigger me.
Recalled being stretched on a table in infirmary at Complex, staring up
at a light and listening to a voice while a drug dripped into my veins.
But was a hundred years ago, endless time of nightmares, unendurable
pressure, pain.
Knew now what no-end-is-up feeling was; had experienced before.
Free fall. Was in space.
What had gone wrong? Had Mike dropped a decimal point? Or had he
given in to childish nature and played a joke, not realizing would kill?
Then why, after all years of pain, was I alive? Or was I? Was this normal
way for ghost to feel, just lonely, lost, nowhere?
"Wake up, Manuel! Wake up, Manuel!"
"Oh, shut up!" I snarled. "Button your filthy king-and-ace!"
Recording went on; I paid no attention. Where was that reeking light
switch? No, doesn't take a century of pain to accelerate to Luna's escape
speed at three gravities, merely feels so. Eighty-two seconds--but is one
time when human nervous system feels every microsecond. Three gees is
eighteen grim times as much as a Loonie ought to weigh.
Then discovered those vacuum skulls had not put arm back on. For
some silly reason they had taken it off when they stripped me to prepare
me and I was loaded with enough don't-worry and let's-sleep pills not to
protest. No huhu had they put it on again. But that drecklich switch was
on my left and sleeve of p-suit was empty.
Spent next ten years getting unstrapped with one hand, then a
twenty-year sentence floating around in dark before managed to find my
cradle again, figure out which was head end, and from that hint locate
switch by touch. That compartment was not over two meters in any
dimension. This turns out to be larger than Old Dome in free fall and
total darkness. Found it. We had light.
(And don't ask why that coffin did not have at least three lighting
systems all working all time. Habit, probably. A lighting system implies
a switch to control it, nyet? Thing was built in two days; should be
thankful switch worked.)
Once I had light, cubic shrank to true claustrophobic dimensions
and ten percent smaller, and I took a look at Prof.
Dead, apparently. Well, he had every excuse. Envied him but was now
supposed to check his pulse and breathing and suchlike in case he had

been unlucky and still had such troubles. And was again hampered and not
just by being onearmed. Grain load had been dried and depressured as
usual before loading but that cell was supposed to be pressured--oh,
nothing fancy, just a tank with air in it. Our p-suits were supposed to
handle needs such as life's breath for those two days. But even best psuit is more comfortable in pressure than in vacuum and, anyhow, I was
supposed to be able to get at my patient.
Could not. Didn't need to open helmet to know this steel can had
not stayed gas tight, knew at once, naturally, from way p-suit felt. Oh,
drugs I had for Prof, heart stimulants and so forth, were in field
ampules; could jab them through his suit. But how to check heart and
breathing? His suit was cheapest sort, sold for Loonie who rarely Leaves
warren; had no readouts.
His mouth hung open and eyes stared. A deader, I decided. No need
to ex Prof beyond that old limen; had eliminated himself. Tried to see
pulse on throat; his helmet was in way.
They had provided a program clock which was mighty kind of them.
Showed I had been out forty-four-plus hours, all to plan, and in three
hours we should receive horrible booting to place us in parking orbit
around Terra. Then, after two circums, call it three more hours, we
should start injection into landing program--if Poona Ground Control
didn't change its feeble mind and leave us in orbit. Reminded self that
was unlikely; grain is not left in vacuum longer than necessary. Has
tendency to become puffed wheat or popped corn, which not only lowers
value but can split those thin canisters like a melon. Wouldn't that be
sweet? Why had they packed us in with grain? Why not just a load of rock
that doesn't mind vacuum?
Had time to think about that and to become very thirsty. Took
nipple for half a mouthful, no more, because certainly did not want to
take six gees with a full bladder. (Need not have worried; was equipped
with catheter. But did not know.)
When time got short I decided couldn't hurt Prof to give him a jolt
of drug that was supposed to take him through heavy acceleration; then,
after in parking orbit, give him heart stimulant--since didn't seem as if
anything could hurt him.
Gave him first drug, then spent rest of minutes struggling back
into straps, one-handed. Was sorry I didn't know name of my helpful
friend; could have cursed him better.
Ten gees gets you into parking orbit around Terra in a mere 3 .26 x
10^7 microseconds; merely seems longer, ten gravities being sixty times
what a fragile sack of protoplasm should be asked to endure. Call it
thirty-three seconds. My truthful word, I suspect my ancestress in Salem
spent a worse half minute day they made her dance.
Gave Prof heart stimulant, then spent three hours trying to decide
whether to drug self as well as Prof for landing sequence. Decided
against. All drug had done for me at catapulting had been to swap a
minute and a half of misery and two days of boredom for a century of
terrible dreams--and besides, if those last minutes were going to be my
very last, I decided to experience them. Bad as they would be, they were
my very own and I would not give them up.
They were bad. Six gees did not feel better than ten; felt worse.
Four gees no relief. Then we were kicked harder. Then suddenly, just for
seconds, in free fall again. Then came splash which was not "gentle" and
which we took on straps, not pads, as we went in headfirst. Also, don't

think Mike realized that, after diving in hard, we would then surface and
splash hard again before we damped down into floating. Earthworms call it
"floating" but is nothing like floating in free fall; you do it at one
gee, six times what is decent, and odd side motions tacked on. Very odd
motions--Mike had assured us that solar weather was good, no radiation
danger inside that Iron Maiden. But he had not been so interested in
Earthside Indian Ocean weather; prediction was acceptable for landing
barges and suppose he felt that was good enough--and I would have thought
so, too.
Stomach was supposed to be empty. But I filled helmet with sourest,
nastiest fluid you would ever go a long way to avoid. Then we turned
completely over and I got it in hair and eyes and some in nose. This is
thing earthworms call "seasickness" and is one of many horrors they take
for granted.
Won't go into long period during which we were towed into port. Let
it stand that, in addition to seasickness, my air bottles were playing
out. They were rated for twelve hours, plenty for a fifty-hour orbit most
of which I was unconscious and none involving heavy exercise, but not
quite enough with some hours of towing added. By time barge finally held
still I was almost too dopy to care about trying to break out.
Except for one fact--We were picked up, I think, and tumbled a bit,
then brought to rest with me upside down. This is a no-good position at
best under one gravity; simply impossible when supposed to a) unstrap
self, b) get out of suit-shaped cavity, c) get loose a sledgehammer
fastened with butterfly nuts to bulkhead. d) smash same against
breakaways guarding escape hatch, e) batter way out, and f) finally, drag
an old man in a p-suit out after you.
Didn't finish step a); passed out head downwards.
Lucky this was emergency-last-resort routine. Stu LaJoie had been
notified before we left; news services had been warned shortly before we
landed. I woke up with people leaning over me, passed out again, woke up
second time in hospital bed, flat on back with heavy feeling in chest-was heavy and weak all over--but not ill, just tired, bruised, hungry,
thirsty, languid. Was a transparent plastic tent over bed which accounted
for fact I was having no trouble breathing.
At once was closed in on from both sides, a tiny Hindu nurse with
big eyes on one side, Stuart LaJoie on other. He grinned at me, "Hi,
cobber! How do you feel?"
"Uh... I'm right. But oh bloody! What a way to travel!"
"Prof says it's the only way. What a tough old boy he is."
"Hold it. Prof said? Prof is dead."
"Not at all. Not in good shape--we've got him in a pneumatic bed
with a round-the-clock watch and more instruments wired into him than you
would believe. But he's alive and will be able to do his job. But, truly,
he didn't mind the trip; he never knew about it, so he says. Went to
sleep in one hospital, woke up in another. I thought he was wrong when he
refused to let me wangle it to send a ship but he was not--the publicity
has been tremendous!"
I said slowly, "You say Prof 'refused' to let you send a ship?"
"I should say 'Chairman Selene' refused. Didn't you see the
dispatches, Mannie?"
"No." Too late to fight over it. "But last few days have been
busy."
"A dinkum word! Here, too--don't recall when last I dossed."

"You sound like a Loonie."
"I am a Loonie, Mannie, don't ever doubt it. But the sister is
looking daggers at me." Stu picked her up, turned her around. I decided
he wasn't all Loonie yet. But nurse didn't resent. "Go play somewhere
else, dear, and I'll give your patient back to you--still warm--in a few
minutes." He shut a door on her and came back to bed. "But Adam was
right; this way was not only wonderful publicity but safer."
"Publicity, I suppose. But 'safer'? Let's not talk about!"
"Safer, my old. You weren't shot at. Yet they had two hours in
which they knew right where you were, a big fat target. They couldn't
make up their minds what to do; they haven't formed a policy yet. They
didn't even dare not bring you down on schedule; the news was full of it,
I had stories slanted and waiting. Now they don't dare touch you, you're
popular heroes. Whereas if I had waited to charter a ship and fetch
you... Well, I don't know. We probably would have been ordered into
parking orbit; then you two--and myself, perhaps--would have been taken
off under arrest. No skipper is going to risk missiles no matter how much
he's paid. The proof of the pudding, cobber. But let me brief you. You're
both citizens of The People's Directorate of Chad, best I could do on
short notice. Also, Chad has recognized Luna. I had to buy one prime
minister, two generals, some tribal chiefs and a minister of finance-cheap for such a hurry-up job. I haven't been able to get you diplomatic
immunity but I hope to, before you leave hospital. At present they
haven't even dared arrest you; they can't figure out what you've done.
They have guards outside but simply for your 'protection'--and a good
thing, or you would have reporters nine deep shoving microphones into
your face."
"Just what have we done?--that they know about, I mean. Illegal
immigration?"
"Not even that, Mannie. You never were a consignee and you have
derivative PanAfrican citizenship through one of your grandfathers, no
huhu. In Professor de la Paz's case we dug up proof that he had been
granted naturalized Chad citizenship forty years back, waited for the ink
to dry, and used it. You're not even illegally entered here in India. Not
only did they bring you down themselves, knowing that you were in that
barge, but also a control officer very kindly and fairly cheaply stamped
your virgin passports. In addition to that, Prof's exile has no legal
existence as the government that proscribed him no longer exists and a
competent court has taken notice--that was more expensive."
Nurse came back in, indignant as a mother cat. "Lord Stuart you
must let my patient rest!"
"At once, ma chere."
"You're 'Lord Stuart'?"
"Should be 'Comte.' Or I can lay a dubious claim to being the
Macgregor. The blue-blood bit helps; these people haven't been happy
since they took their royalty away from them."
As he left he patted her rump. Instead of screaming, she wiggled
it. Was smiling as she came over to me. Stu was going to have to watch
that stuff when he went back to Luna. If did.
She asked how I felt. Told her I was right, just hungry. "Sister,
did you see some prosthetic arms in our luggage?"
She had and I felt better with number-six in place. Had selected it
and number-two and social arm as enough for trip. Number-two was
presumably still in Complex; I hoped somebody was taking care of it. But

number-six is most all-around useful arm; with it and social one I'd be
okay.
Two days later we left for Agra to present credentials to Federated
Nations. I was in bad shape and not just high gee; could do well enough
in a wheel chair and could even walk a little although did not in public.
What I had was a sore throat that missed pneumonia only through drugs,
traveler's trots, skin disease on hands and spreading to feet--just like
my other trips to that disease-ridden hole, Terra. We Loonies don't know
how lucky we are, living in a place that has tightest of quarantines,
almost no vermin and what we have controlled by vacuum anytime necessary.
Or unlucky, since we have almost no immunities if turns out we need them.
Still, wouldn't swap; never heard word "venereal" until first went
Earthside and had thought "common cold" was state of ice miner's feet.
And wasn't cheerful for other reason. Stu had fetched us a message
from Adam Selene; buried in it, concealed even from Stir, was news that
chances had dropped to worse than one in a hundred. Wondered what point
in risking crazy trip if made odds worse? Did Mike really know what
chances were? Couldn't see any way he could compute them no matter how
many facts he had.
But Prof didn't seem worried. He talked to platoons of reporters,
smiled at endless pictures, gave out statements, telling world he placed
great confidence in Federated Nations and was sure our just claims would
be recognized and that he wanted to thank "Friends of Free Luna" for
wonderful help in bringing true story of our small but sturdy nation
before good people of Terra--F. of F. L. being Stu, a professional public
opinion firm, several thousand chronic petition signers, and a great
stack of Hong Kong dollars.
I had picture taken, too, and tried to smile, but dodged questions
by pointing to throat and croaking.
In Agra we were lodged in a lavish suite in hotel that had once
been palace of a maharajah (and still belonged to him, even though India
is supposed to be socialist) and interviews and picture-taking went on-hardly dared get out of wheel chair even to visit W. C. as was under
orders from Prof never to be photographed vertically. He was always
either in bed or in a stretcher--bed baths, bedpans, everything--not only
because safer, considering age, and easier for any Loonie, but also for
pictures. His dimples and wonderful, gentle, persuasive personality were
displayed in hundreds of millions of video screens, endless news
pictures.
But his personality did not get us anywhere in Agra. Prof was
carried to office of President of Grand Assembly, me being pushed
alongside, and there he attempted to present his credentials as
Ambassador to F. N. and prospective Senator for Luna--was referred to
Secretary General and at his offices we were granted ten minutes with
assistant secretary who sucked teeth and said he could accept our
credentials "without prejudice and without implied commitment." They were
referred to Credentials Committee--who sat on them.
I got fidgety. Prof read Keats. Grain barges continued to arrive at
Bombay.
In a way was not sorry about latter. When we flew from Bombay to
Agra we got up before dawn and were taken out to field as city was
waking. Every Loonie has his hole, whether luxury of a longestablished
home like Davis Tunnels or rock still raw from drill; cubic is no problem
and can't be for centuries.

Bombay was bee-swarms of people. Are over million (was told) who
have no home but some piece of pavement. A family might claim right (and
hand down by will, generation after generation) to sleep on a piece two
meters long and one wide at a described location in front of a shop.
Entire family sleeps on that space, meaning mother, father, kids, maybe a
grandmother. Would not have believed if had not seen. At dawn in Bombay
roadways, side pavements, even bridges are covered with tight carpet of
human bodies. What do they do? Where do they work? How do they eat? (Did
not look as if they did. Could count ribs.)
If I hadn't believed simple arithmetic that you can't ship stuff
downhill forever without shipping replacement back, would have tossed in
cards. But... tanstanfl. "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch," in
Bombay or in Luna.
At last we were given appointment with an "Investigating
Committee." Not what Prof had asked for. He had requested public hearing
before Senate, complete with video cameras. Only camera at this session
was its "in-camera" nature; was closed. Not too closed, I had little
recorder. But no video. And took Prof two minutes to discover that
committee was actually vips of Lunar Authority or their tame dogs.
Nevertheless was chance to talk and Prof treated them as if they
had power to recognize Luna's independence and willingness to do so.
While they treated us as a cross between naughty children and criminals
up for sentencing.
Prof was allowed to make opening statement. With decorations
trimmed away was assertion that Luna was de-facto a sovereign state, with
an unopposed government in being, a civil condition of peace and order, a
provisional president and cabinet carrying on necessary functions but
anxious to return to private life as soon as Congress completed writing a
constitution--and that we were here to ask that these facts be recognized
de-jure and that Luna be allowed to take her rightful place in councils
of mankind as a member of Federated Nations.
What Prof told them bore a speaking acquaintance with truth and
they were not where they could spot discrepancies. Our "provisional
president" was a computer, and "cabinet" was Wyoh, Finn, Comrade Clayton,
and Terence Sheehan, editor of Pravda, plus Wolfgang Korsakov, board
chairman of LuNoHoCo and a director of Bank of Hong Kong in Luna. But
Wyoh was only person now in Luna who knew that "Adam Selene" was false
face for a computer. She had been terribly nervous at being left to hold
fort alone.
As it was, Adam's "oddity" in never being seen save over video was
always an embarrassment. We had done our best to turn it into a "security
necessity" by opening offices for him in cubic of Authority's Luna City
office and then exploding a small bomb. After this "assassination
attempt" comrades who had been most fretful about Adam's failure to stir
around became loudest in demands that Adam must not take any chances-this being helped by editorials.
But I wondered while Prof was talking what these pompous chooms
would think if they knew that our "president" was a collection of
hardware owned by Authority?
But they just sat staring with chill disapproval, unmoved by Prof's
rhetoric--probably best performance of his life considering he delivered
it flat on back, speaking into a microphone without notes, and hardly
able to see his audience.

Then they started in on us. Gentleman member from Argentina--never
given their names; we weren't socially acceptable--this Argentino
objected to phrase "former Warden" in Prof's speech; that designation had
been obsolete half a century; he insisted that it be struck out and
proper title inserted: "Protector of the Lunar Colonies by Appointment of
the Lunar Authority." Any other wording offended dignity of Lunar
Authority.
Prof asked to comment; "Honorable Chairman" permitted it. Prof said
mildly that he accepted change since Authority was free to designate its
servants in any fashion it pleased and was no intention to offend dignity
of any agency of Federated Nations... but in view of functions of this
office--former functions of this former office--citizens of Luna Free
State would probably go on thinking of it by traditional name.
That made about six of them try to talk at once. Somebody objected
to use of word "Luna" and still more to "Luna Free State"--it was "the
Moon," Earth's Moon, a satellite of Earth and property of Federated
Nations, just as Antarctica was--and these proceedings were a farce.
Was inclined to agree with last point. Chairman asked gentleman
member from North America to please be in order and to address his
remarks through Chair. Did Chair understand from witness's last remark
that this alleged de-facto regime intended to interfere with consignee
system?
Prof fielded that and tossed it back. "Honorable Chairman, I myself
was a consignee, now Luna is my beloved home. My colleague, the Honorable
the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Colonel O'Kelly Davis"--myself!-"is Luna born, and proud of his descent from four transported
grandparents. Luna has grown strong on your outcasts. Give us your poor,
your wretched; we welcome them. Luna has room for them, nearly forty
million square kilometers, an area greater than all Africa--and almost
totally empty. More than that, since by our method of living we occupy
not 'area' but 'cubic' the mind cannot imagine the day when Luna would
refuse another shipload of weary homeless."
Chairman said, "The witness is admonished to refrain from making
speeches. The Chair takes it that your oratory means that the group you
represent agrees to accept prisoners as before."
"No, sir."
"What? Explain yourself."
"Once an immigrant sets foot on Luna today he is a free man, no
matter what his previous condition, free to go where he listeth."
"So? Then what's to keep a consignee from walking across the field,
climbing into another ship, and returning here? I admit that I am puzzled
at your apparent willingness to accept them... but we do not want them.
It is our humane way of getting rid of incorrigibles who would otherwise
have to be executed."
(Could have told him several things that would stop what he
pictured; he had obviously never been to Luna. As for "incorrigibles," if
really are, Luna eliminates such faster than Terra ever did. Back when I
was very young, they sent us a gangster lord, from Los Angeles I believe;
he arrived with squad of stooges, his bodyguards, and was cockily ready
to take over Luna, as was rumored to have taken over a prison somewhere
Earthside.
(None lasted two weeks. Gangster boss didn't make it to barracks;
hadn't listened when told how to wear a p-suit.)

"There is nothing to keep him from going home so far as we are
concerned, sir," Prof answered, "although your police here on Terra might
cause him to think. But I've never heard of a consignee arriving with
funds enough to buy a ticket home. Is this truly an issue? The ships are
yours; Luna has no ships--and let me add that we are sorry that the ship
scheduled for Luna this month was canceled. I am not complaining that it
forced on my colleague and myself--Prof stopped to smile--a most informal
method of travel. I simply hope that this does not represent policy. Luna
has no quarrel with you; your ships are welcome, your trade is welcome,
we are at peace and wish to stay so. Please note that all scheduled grain
shipments have come through on time."
(Prof did always have gift for changing subject.)
They fiddled with minor matters then. Nosy from North America
wanted to know what had really happened to "the Ward--" He stopped
himself. "The Protector. Senator Hobart" Prof answered that he had
suffered a stroke (a "coup" is a "stroke") and was no longer able to
carry out his duties--but was in good health otherwise and receiving
constant medical care. Prof added thoughtfully that he suspected that the
old gentleman had been failing for some time, in view of his
indiscretions this past year... especially his many invasions of rights
of free citizens, including ones who were not and never had been
consignees.
Story was not hard to swallow. When those busy scientists managed
to break news of our coup, they had reported Warden as dead... whereas
Mike had kept him alive and on job by impersonating him. When Authority
Earthside demanded a report from Warden on this wild rumor, Mike had
consulted Prof, then had accepted call and given a convincing imitation
of senility, managing to deny, confirm, and confuse every detail. Our
announcements followed, and thereafter Warden was no longer available
even in his computer alter ego. Three days later we declared
independence.
This North American wanted to know what reason they had to believe
that one word of this was true? Prof smiled most saintly smile and made
effort to spread thin hands before letting them fall to coverlet. "The
gentleman member from North America is urged to go to Luna, visit Senator
Hobart's sickbed, and see for himself. Indeed all Terran citizens are
invited to visit Luna at any time, see anything. We wish to be friends,
we are at peace, we have nothing to hide. My only regret is that my
country is unable to furnish transportation; for that we must turn to
you."
Chinee member looked at Prof thoughtfully. He had not said a word
but missed nothing.
Chairman recessed hearing until fifteen hundred. They gave us a
retiring room and sent in lunch. I wanted to talk but Prof shook head,
glanced around room, tapped ear. So I shut up. Prof napped then and I
leveled out my wheel chair and joined him; on Terra we both slept all we
could. Helped. Not enough.
They didn't wheel us back in until sixteen hundred; committee was
already sitting. Chairman then broke own rule against speeches and made a
long one more-in-sorrow-than-anger.
Started by reminding us that Luna Authority was a nonpolitical
trusteeship charged with solemn duty of insuring that Earth's satellite
the Moon--Luna, as some called it--was never used for military purposes.
He told us that Authority had guarded this sacred trust more than a

century, while governments fell and new governments rose, alliances
shifted and shifted again--indeed, Authority was older than Federated
Nations, deriving original charter from an older international body, and
so well had it kept that trust that it had lasted through wars and
turmoils and realignments.
(This is news? But you see what he was building towards.)
"The Lunar Authority cannot surrender its trust," he told us
solemnly. "However, there appears to be no insuperable obstacle to the
Lunar colonists, if they show political maturity, enjoying a degree of
autonomy. This can be taken under advisement. Much depends on your
behavior. The behavior, I should say, of all you colonists. There have
been riots and destruction of property; this must not be."
I waited for him to mention ninety dead Goons; he never did. I will
never make a statesman; I don't have high-level approach.
"Destroyed property must be paid for," he went on. "Commitments
must be met. If this body you call a Congress can guarantee such things,
it appears to this committee that this so-called Congress could in time
be considered an agency of the Authority for many internal matters.
Indeed it is conceivable that a stable local government might, in time,
assume many duties now failing on the Protector and even be allowed a
delegate, non-voting, in the Grand Assembly. But such recognition would
have to be earned.
"But one thing must be made clear. Earth's major satellite, the
Moon, is by nature's law forever the joint property of all the peoples of
Earth. It does not belong to that handful who by accident of history
happen to live there. The sacred trust laid upon the Lunar Authority is
and forever must be the supreme law of Earth's Moon."
("--accident of history," huh? I expected Prof to shove it down his
throat. I thought he would say--No, never did know what Prof would say.
Here's what he did say): Prof waited through several seconds of silence,
then said, "Honorable Chairman, who is to be exiled this time?"
"What did you say?"
"Have you decided which one of you is to go into exile? Your Deputy
Warden won't take the job"--this was true; he preferred to stay alive.
"He is functioning now only because we have asked him to. If you persist
in believing that we are not independent, then you must be planning to
send up a new warden."
"Protector!"
"Warden. Let us not mince words. Though if we knew who he is to be,
we might be happy to call him 'Ambassador.' We might be able to work with
him, it might not be necessary to send with him armed hoodlums... to rape
and murder our women!"
"Order! Order! The witness will come to order!"
"It is not I who was not in order, Honorable Chairman. Rape it was
and murder most foul. But that is history and now we must look to the
future. Whom are you going to exile?"
Prof struggled to raise self on elbow and I was suddenly alert; was
a cue. "For you all know, sir, that it is a one-way trip. I was born
here. You can see what effort it is for me to return even temporarily to
the planet which has disinherited me. We are outcasts of Earth who--"
He collapsed. Was up out of my chair--and collapsed myself, trying
to reach him.

Was not all play-acting even though I answered a cue. Is terrible
strain on heart to get up suddenly on Terra; thick field grabbed and
smashed me to floor.

Neither of us was hurt and it made juicy news breaks, for I put recording
in Stu's hands and he turned it over to his hired men. Nor were all
headlines against us; Stu had recording cut and edited and slanted.
AUTHORITY TO PLAY ODD MAN OUT?--LUNAR AMBASSADOR COLLAPSES UNDER
GRILLING: "OUTCASTS!" HE CRIES--PROF PAZ POINTS FINGER OF SHAME: STORY
PAGE 8.
Not all were good; nearest to a favorable story in India was
editorial in New India Times inquiring whether Authority was risking
bread of masses in failing to come to terms with Lunar insurgents. Was
suggested that concessions could be made if would insure increased grain
deliveries. Was filled with inflated statistics; Luna did not feed "a
hundred million Hindus"--unless you chose to think of our grain as making
difference between malnutrition and starvation.
On other hand biggest New York paper opined that Authority had made
mistake in treating with us at all, since only thing convicts understood
was taste of lash--troops should land, set us in order, hang guilty,
leave forces to keep order.
Was a quick mutiny, quickly subdued, in Peace Dragoons regiment
from which our late oppressors had come, one started by rumor that they
were to be shipped to Moon. Mutiny not hushed up perfectly; Stu hired
good men.
Next morning a message reached us inquiring if Professor de la Paz
was well enough to resume discussions? We went, and committee supplied
doctor and nurse to watch over Prof. But this time we were searched--and
a recorder removed from my pouch.
I surrendered it without much fuss; was Japanese job supplied by
Stu--to be surrendered. Number-six arm has recess intended for a power
pack but near enough size of my mini-recorder. Didn't need power that
day--and most people, even hardened police officers, dislike to touch a
prosthetic.
Everything discussed day before was ignored... except that chairman
started session by scolding us for "breaking security of a closed
meeting."
Prof replied that it had not been closed so far as we were
concerned and that we would welcome newsmen, video cameras, a gallery,
anyone, as Luna Free State had nothing to hide.
Chairman replied stiffly that so-called Free State did not control
these hearings; these sessions were closed, not to be discussed outside
this room, and that it was so ordered.
Prof looked at me. "Will you help me, Colonel?" I touched controls
of chair, scooted around, was shoving his stretcher wagon with my chair
toward door before chairman realized bluff had been called. Prof allowed

himself to be persuaded to stay without promising anything. Hard to
coerce a man who faints if he gets overexcited.
Chairman said that there had been many irrelevancies yesterday and
matters discussed best left undiscussed--and that he would permit no
digressions today. He looked at Argentino, then at North American.
He went on: "Sovereignty is an abstract concept, one that has been
redefined many times as mankind has learned to live in peace. We need not
discuss it. The real question, Professor--or even Ambassador de-facto, if
you like; we shan't quibble--the real question is this: Are you prepared
to guarantee that the Lunar Colonies will keep their commitments?"
"What commitments, sir?"
"All commitments, but I have in mind specifically your commitments
concerning grain shipments."
"I know of no such commitments, sir," Prof answered with innocence.
Chairman's hand tightened on gavel. But he answered quietly, "Come,
sir, there is no need to spar over words. I refer to the quota of grain
shipments--and to the increased quota, a matter of thirteen percent, for
this new fiscal year. Do we have assurance that you will honor those
commitments? This is a minimum basis for discussion, else these talks can
go no further."
"Then I am sorry to say, sir, that it would appear that our talks
must cease."
"You're not being serious."
"Quite serious, sir. The sovereignty of Free Luna is not the
abstract matter you seem to feel it is. These commitments you speak of
were the Authority contracting with itself. My country is not bound by
such. Any commitments from the sovereign nation I have the honor to
represent are still to be negotiated."
"Rabble!" growled North American. "I told you you were being too
soft on them. Jailbirds. Thieves and whores. They don't understand decent
treatment."
"Order!"
"Just remember, I told you. If I had them in Colorado, we would
teach them a thing or two; we know how to handle their sort."
"The gentleman member will please be in order."
"I'm afraid," said Hindu member--Parsee in fact, but committeeman
from India--"I'm afraid I must agree in essence with the gentleman member
from the North American Directorate. India cannot accept the concept that
the grain commitments are mere scraps of paper. Decent people do not play
politics with hunger."
"And besides," the Argentino put in, "they breed like animals.
Pigs!"
(Prof made me take a tranquilizing drug before that session. Had
insisted on seeing me take it.)
Prof said quietly, "Honorable Chairman, may I have consent to
amplify my meaning before we conclude, perhaps too hastily, that these
talks must be abandoned?"
"Proceed."
"Unanimous consent? Free of interruption?"
Chairman looked around. "Consent is unanimous," he stated, "and the
gentlemen members are placed on notice that I will invoke special rule
fourteen at the next outburst. The sergeant-at-arms is directed to note
this and act. The witness will proceed."

"I will be brief, Honorable Chairman." Prof said something in
Spanish; all I caught was "Señor." Argentina turned dark but did not
answer. Prof went on, "I must first answer the gentleman member from
North America on a matter of personal privilege since he has impugned my
fellow countrymen. I for one have seen the inside of more than one jail;
I accept the title--nay, I glory in the title of 'jailbird.' We citizens
of Luna are jailbirds and descendants of jailbirds. But Luna herself is a
stern schoolmistress; those who have lived through her harsh lessons have
no cause to feel ashamed. In Luna City a man may leave purse unguarded or
home unlocked and feel no fear... I wonder if this is true in Denver? As
may be, I have no wish to visit Colorado to learn a thing or two; I am
satisfied with what Mother Luna has taught me. And rabble we may be, but
we are now a rabble in arms.
"To the gentleman member from India let me say that we do not 'play
politics with hunger.' What we ask is an open discussion of facts of
nature unbound by political assumptions false to fact. If we can hold
this discussion, I can promise to show a way in which Luna can continue
grain shipments and expand them enormously... to the great benefit of
India."
Both Chinee and Indian looked alert. Indian started to speak,
checked himself, then said, "Honorable Chairman, will the Chair ask the
witness to explain what he means?"
"The witness is invited to amplify."
"Honorable Chairman, gentlemen members, there is indeed a way for
Luna to expand by tenfold or even a hundred her shipments to our hungry
millions. The fact that grain barges continued to arrive on schedule
during our time of trouble and are still arriving today is proof that our
intentions are friendly. But you do not get milk by beating the cow.
Discussions of how to augment our shipments must be based on the facts of
nature, not on the false assumption that we are slaves, bound by a work
quota we never made. So which shall it be? Will you persist in believing
that we are slaves, indentured to an Authority other than ourselves? Or
will you acknowledge that we are free, negotiate with us, and learn how
we can help you?"
Chairman said, "In other words you ask us to buy a pig in a poke.
You demand that we legalize your outlaw status... then you will talk
about fantastic claims that you can increase grain shipments ten- or a
hundredfold. What you claim is impossible; I am expert in Lunar
economics. And what you ask is impossible; takes the Grand Assembly to
admit a new nation."
Then place it before the Grand Assembly. Once seated as sovereign
equals, we will discuss how to increase shipments and negotiate terms.
Honorable Chairman, we grow the grain, we own it. We can grow far more.
But not as slaves. Luna's sovereign freedom must first be recognized."
"Impossible and you know it. The Lunar Authority cannot abdicate
its sacred responsibility."
Prof sighed. "It appears to be an impasse. I can only suggest that
these hearings be recessed while we all take thought. Today our barges
are arriving... but the moment that I am forced to notify my government
that I have failed... they... will... stop!"
Prof's head sank back on pillow as if it had been too much for him-as may have been. I was doing well enough but was young and had had
practice in how to visit Terra and stay alive. A Loonie his age should
not risk it. After minor foofooraw which Prof ignored they loaded us into

a lorry and scooted us back to hotel. Once under way I said, "Prof, what
was it you said to Señor Jellybelly that raised blood pressure?"
He chuckled. "Comrade Stuart's investigations of these gentlemen
turn up remarkable facts. I asked who owned a certain brothel off Calle
Florida in B. A. these days and did it now have a star redhead?"
"Why? You used to patronize it?" Tried to imagine Prof in such!
"Never. It has been forty years since I was last in Buenos Aires.
He owns that establishment, Manuel, through a dummy, and his wife, a
beauty with Titian hair, once worked in it."
Was sorry had asked. "Wasn't that a foul blow? And undiplomatic?"
But Prof closed eyes and did not answer.
He was recovered enough to spend an hour at a reception for newsmen
that night, with white hair framed against a purple pillow and thin body
decked out in embroidered pajamas. Looked like vip corpse at an important
funeral, except for eyes and dimples. I looked mighty vip too, in black
and gold uniform which Stu claimed was Lunar diplomatic uniform of my
rank. Could have been, if Lana had had such things--did not or I would
have known. I prefer a p-suit; collar was tight. Nor did I ever find out
what decorations on it meant. ~A reporter asked me about one, based on
Luna at crescent as seen from Terra; told him it was a prize for
spelling. Stu was in earshot and said, "The Colonel is modest. That
decoration is of the same rank as the Victoria Cross and in his case was
awarded for an act of gallantry on the glorious, tragic day of--"
He led him away, still talking. Stu could lie standing up almost as
well as Prof. Me, I have to think out a lie ahead of time.
India newspapers and casts were rough that night; "threat" to stop
grain shipments made them froth. Gentlest proposal was to clean out Luna,
exterminate us "criminal troglodytes" and replace us with "honest Hindu
peasants" who understood sacredness of life and would ship grain and more
grain.
Prof picked that night to talk and give handouts about Luna's
inability to continue shipments, and why--and Stu's organization spread
release throughout Terra. Some reporters took time to dig out sense of
figures and tackled Prof on glaring discrepancy: "Professor de la Paz,
here you say that grain shipments will dwindle away through failure of
natural resources and that by 2082 Luna won't even be able to feed its
own people. Yet earlier today you told the Lunar Authority that you could
increase shipments a dozen times or more."
Prof said sweetly, "That committee is the Lunar Authority?"
"Well... it's an open secret."
"So it is, sir, but they have maintained the fiction of being an
impartial investigating committee of the Grand Assembly. Don't you think
they should disqualify themselves? So that we could receive a fair
hearing?"
"Uh... it's not my place to say, Professor. Let's get back to my
question. How do you reconcile the two?"
"I'm interested in why it's not your place to say, sir. Isn't it
the concern of every citizen of Terra to help avoid a situation which
will produce war between Terra and her neighbor?"
"'War'? What in the world makes you speak of 'war,' Professor?"
"Where else can it end, sir? If the Lunar Authority persists in its
intransigence? We cannot accede to their demands; those figures show why.
If they will not see this, then they will attempt to subdue us by
force... and we will fight back. Like cornered rats--for cornered we are,

unable to retreat, unable to surrender. We do not choose war; we wish to
live in peace with our neighbor planet--in peace and peacefully trade.
But the choice is not ours. We are small, you are gigantic. I predict
that the next move will be for the Lunar Authority to attempt to subdue
Luna by force. This 'peace-keeping' agency will start the first
interplanetary war."
Journalist frowned. "Aren't you overstating it? Let's assume the
Authority--or the Grand Assembly, as the Authority hasn't any warships of
its own--let's suppose the nations of Earth decide to displace your, uh,
'government.' You might fight, on Luna--I suppose you would. But that
hardly constitutes interplanetary war. As you pointed out, Luna has no
ships. To put it bluntly, you can't reach us."
I had chair close by Prof's stretcher, listening. He turned to me.
"Tell them, Colonel."
I parroted it. Prof and Mike had worked out stock situation. I had
memorized and was ready with answers. I said, "Do you gentlemen remember
the Pathfinder? How she came plunging in, out of control?"
They remembered. Nobody forgets greatest disaster of early days of
space flight when unlucky Pathfinder hit a Belgian village.
"We have no ships," I went on, "but would be possible to throw
those bargeloads of grain... instead of delivering them parking orbit."
Next day this evoked a headline: LOONIES THREATEN TO THROW RICE. At
moment it produced awkward silence.
Finally journalist said, "Nevertheless I would like to know how you
reconcile your two statements--no more grain after 2082... and ten or a
hundred times as much."
"There is no conflict," Prof answered. "They are based on different
sets of circumstances. The figures you have been looking at show the
present circumstances... and the disaster they will produce in only a few
years through drainage of Luna's natural resources--disaster which these
Authority bureaucrats--or should I say 'authoritarian bureaucrats?'-would avert by telling us to stand in the corner like naughty children!"
Prof paused for labored breathing, went on: "The circumstances
under which we can continue, or greatly increase, our grain shipments are
the obvious corollary of the first. As an old teacher I can hardly
refrain from classroom habits; the corollary should be left as an
exercise for the student. Will someone attempt it?"
Was uncomfortable silence, then a little man with strange accent
said slowly, "It sound to me as if you talk about way to replenish
natural resource."
"Capital! Excellent!" Prof flashed dimples. "You, sir, will have a
gold star on your term report! To make grain requires water and plant
foods--phosphates, other things, ask the experts. Send these things to
us; we'll send them back as wholesome grain. Put down a hose in the
limitless Indian Ocean. Line up those millions of cattle here in India;
collect their end product and ship it to us. Collect your own night soil-don't bother to sterilize it; we've learned to do such things cheaply
and easily. Send us briny sea water, rotten fish, dead animals, city
sewage, cow manure, offal of any sort--and we will send it back, tonne
for tonne as golden grain. Send ten times as much, we'll send back ten
times as much grain. Send us your poor, your dispossessed, send them by
thousands and hundreds of thousands; we'll teach them swift, efficient
Lunar methods of tunnel farming and ship you back unbelievable tonnage.

Gentlemen, Luna is one enormous fallow farm, four thousand million
hectares, waiting to be plowed!"
That startled them. Then someone said slowly, "But what do you get
out of it? Luna, I mean."
Prof shrugged. "Money. In the form of trade goods. There are many
things you make cheaply which are dear in Luna. Drugs. Tools. Book films.
Gauds for our lovely ladies. Buy our grain and you can sell to us at a
happy profit."
A Hindu journalist looked thoughtful, started to write. Next to him
was a European type who seemed unimpressed. He said, "Professor, have you
any idea of the cost of shipping that much tonnage to the Moon?"
Prof waved it aside. "A technicality. Sir, there was a time when it
was not simply expensive to ship goods across oceans but impossible. Then
it was expensive, difficult, dangerous. Today you sell goods half around
your planet almost as cheaply as next door; long-distance shipping is the
least important factor in cost. Gentlemen, I am not an engineer. But I
have learned this about engineers. When something must be done, engineers
can find a way that is economically feasible. If you want the grain that
we can grow, turn your engineers loose." Prof gasped and labored,
signaled for help and nurses wheeled him away.
I declined to be questioned on it, telling them that they must talk
to Prof when he was well enough to see them. So they pecked at me on
other lines. One man demanded to know why, since we paid no taxes, we
colonists thought we had a right to run things our own way? After all,
those colonies had been established by Federated Nations--by some of
them. It had been terribly expensive. Earth had paid all bills--and now
you colonists enjoy benefits and pay not one dime of taxes. Was that
fair?
I wanted to tell him to blow it. But Prof had again made me take a
tranquilizer and had required me to swot that endless list of answers to
trick questions. "Lets take that one at a time," I said. "First, what is
it you want us to pay taxes for? Tell me what I get and perhaps I'll buy
it. No, put it this way. Do you pay taxes?"
"Certainly I do! And so should you."
"And what do you get for your taxes?"
"Huh? Taxes pay for government."
I said, "Excuse me, I'm ignorant. I've lived my whole life in Luna,
I don't know much about your government. Can you feed it to me in small
pieces? What do you get for your money?"
They all got interested and anything this aggressive little choom
missed, others supplied. I kept a list. When they stopped, I read it
back: "Free hospitals--aren't any in Luna. Medical insurance--we have
that but apparently not what you mean by it. If a person wants insurance,
he goes to a bookie and works b-Out a bet. You can hedge anything, for a
price. I don't hedge my health, I'm healthy. Or was till I came here. We
have a public library, one Carnegie Foundation started with a few book
films. It gets along by charging fees. Public roads. I suppose that would
be our tubes. But they are no more free than air is free. Sorry, you have
free air here, don't you? I mean our tubes were built by companies who
put up money and are downright nasty about expecting it back and then
some. Public schools. There are schools in all warrens and I never heard
of them turning away pupils, so I guess they are 'public.' But they pay
well, too, because anyone in Luna who knows something useful and is
willing to teach it charges all the traffic will bear."

I went on: "Let's see what else---Social security. I'm not sure
what that is but whatever it is, we don't have it. Pensions. You can buy
a pension. Most people don't; most families are large and old people, say
a hundred and up, either fiddle along at something they like, or sit and
watch video. Or sleep. They sleep a lot, after say a hundred and twenty."
"Sir, excuse me. Do people really live as long on the Moon as they
say?"
I looked surprised but wasn't; this was a "simulated question" for
which an answer had been taped. "Nobody knows how long a person will live
in Luna; we haven't been there long enough. Our oldest citizens were born
Earthside, it's no test. So far, no one born in Luna died of old age, but
that's still no test; they haven't had time to grow old yet, less than a
century. But--Well, take me, madam; how old would you say I am? I'm
authentic Loonie, third generation."
"Uh, truthfully, Colonel Davis, I was surprised at your
youthfulness--for this mission, I mean. You appear to be about twentytwo. Are you older? Not much, I fancy."
"Madam, I regret that your local gravitation makes it impossible
for me to bow. Thank you. I've been married longer than that."
"What? Oh, you're jesting!"
"Madam, I would never venture to guess a lady's age but, if you
will emigrate to Luna, you will keep your present youthful loveliness
much longer and add at least twenty years to your life. " I looked at
list. "I'll lump the rest of this together by saying we don't have any of
it in Luna, so I can't see any reason to pay taxes for it. On that other
point, sir, surely you know that the initial cost of the colonies has
long since been repaid several times over through grain shipments alone?
We are being bled white of our most essential resources. . . and not even
being paid an open-market price. That's why the Lunar Authority is being
stubborn; they intend to go on bleeding us. The idea that Luna has been
an expense to Terra and the investment must be recovered is a lie
invented by the Authority to excuse their treating us as slaves. The
truth is that Luna has not cost Terra one dime this century--and the
original investment has long since been paid back."
He tried to rally. "Oh, surely you're not claiming that the Lunar
colonies have paid all the billions of dollars it took to develop space
flight?"
"I could present a good case. However there is no excuse to charge
that against us. You have space flight, you people of Terra. We do not.
Luna has not one ship. So why should we pay for what we never received?
It's like the rest of this list. We don't get it, why should we pay for
it?"
Had been stalling, waiting for a claim that Prof had told me I was
sure to hear... and got it at last.
"Just a moment, please!" came a confident voice. "You ignored the
two most important items on that list. Police protection and armed
forces. You boasted that you were willing to pay for what you get... so
how about paying almost a century of back taxes for those two? It should
be quite a bill, quite a bill!" He smiled smugly.
Wanted to thank him!--thought Prof was going to chide me for
failing to yank it out. People looked at each other and nodded, pleased I
had been scored on. Did best to look innocent. "Please? Don't understand.
Luna has neither police nor armed forces."

"You know what I mean. You enjoy the protection of the Peace Forces
of the Federated Nations. And you do have police. Paid for by the Lunar
Authority! I know, to my certain knowledge, that two phalanges were sent
to the Moon less than a year ago to serve as policemen."
"Oh. " I sighed. "Can you tell me how F. N. peace forces protect
Luna? I did not know that any of your nations wanted to attack us. We are
far away and have nothing anyone envies. Or did you mean we should pay
them to leave us alone? If so, there is an old saying that once you pay
Danegeld, you never get rid of the Dane. Sir, we will fight F. N. armed
forces if we must... we shall never pay them.
"Now about those so-called 'policemen.' They were not sent to
protect us. Our Declaration of Independence told the true story about
those hoodlums--did your newspapers print it?" (Some had, some hadn't-depended on country.) "They went mad and started raping and murdering!
And now they are dead! So don't send us any more troops!"
Was suddenly "tired" and had to leave. Really was tired; not much
of an actor and making that talk-talk come out way Prof thought it should
was strain.

18
Was not told till later that I had received an assist in that interview;
lead about "police" and "armed forces" had been fed by a stooge; Stu
LaJoie took no chances. But by time I knew, I had had experience in
handling interviews; we had them endlessly.
Despite being tired was not through that night. In addition to
press some Agra diplomatic corps had risked showing up--few and none
officially, even from Chad. But we were curiosities and they wanted to
look at us.
Only one was important, a Chinee. Was startled to see him; he was
Chinee member of committee. I met him, simply as "Dr. Chan" and we
pretended to be meeting first time.
He was that Dr. Chan who was then Senator from Great China and also
Great China's long-time number-one boy in Lunar Authority--and, much
later, Vice-Chairman and Premier, shortly before his assassin.
After getting out point I was supposed to make, with bonus through
others that could have waited, I guided chair to bedroom and was at once
summoned to Prof's. "Manuel, I'm sure you noticed our distinguished
visitor from the Middle Kingdom."
"Old Chinee from committee?"
"Try to curb the Loonie talk, son. Please don't use it at all here,
even with me. Yes. He wants to know what we meant by 'tenfold or a
hundredfold.' So tell him."
"Straight? Or swindle?"
"The straight. This man is no fool. Can you handle the technical
details?"
"Done my homework. Unless he's expert in ballistics."
"He's not. But don't pretend to know anything you don't know. And
don't assume that he's friendly. But he could be enormously helpful if he

concludes that our interests and his coincide. But don't try to persuade
him. He's in my study. Good luck. And remember--speak standard English."
Dr. Chan stood up as I came in; I apologized for not standing. He
said that he understood difficulties that a gentleman from Luna labored
under here and for me not to exert myself--shook hands with himself and
sat down.
I'll skip some formalities. Did we or did we not have some specific
solution when we claimed there was a cheap way to ship massive tonnage to
Luna?
Told him was a method, expensive in investment but cheap in running
expenses. "It's the one we use on Luna, sir. A catapult, an escape-speed
induction catapult."
His expression changed not at all. "Colonel, are you aware that
such has been proposed many times and always rejected for what seemed
good reasons? Something to do with air pressure."
"Yes, Doctor. But we believe, based on extensive analysis by
computer and on our experience with catapulting, that today the problem
can be solved. Two of our larger firms, the LuNoHo Company and the Bank
of Hong Kong in Luna, are ready to head a syndicate to do it as a private
venture. They would need help here on Earth and might share voting stock-though they would prefer to sell bonds and retain control. Primarily
what they need is a concession from some government, a permanent easement
on which to build the catapult. Probably India."
(Above was set speech. LuNoHoCo was bankrupt if anybody examined
books, and Hong Kong Bank was strained; was acting as central bank for
country undergoing upheaval. Purpose was to get in last word, "India."
Prof had coached me that this word must come last.)
Dr. Chan answered, "Never mind financial aspects. Anything which is
physically possible can always be made financially possible; money is a
bugaboo of small minds. Why do you select India?"
"Well, sir, India now consumes, I believe, over ninety per cent of
our grain shipments--"
"Ninety-three point one percent."
"Yes, sir. India is deeply interested in our grain so it seemed
likely that she would cooperate. She could grant us land, make labor and
materials available, and so forth. But I mentioned India because she
holds a wide choice of possible sites, very high mountains not too far
from Terra's equator. The latter is not essential, just helpful. But the
site must be a high mountain. It's that air pressure you spoke of, or air
density. The catapult head should be at as high altitude as feasible but
the ejection end, where the load travels over eleven kilometers per
second, must be in air so thin that it approaches vacuum. Which calls for
a very high mountain. Take the peak Nanda Devi, around four hundred
kilometers from here. It has a railhead sixty kilometers from it and a
road almost to its base. It is eight thousand meters high. I don't know
that Nanda Devi is ideal. It is simply a possible site with good
logistics; the ideal site would have to be selected by Terran engineers."
"A higher mountain would be better?"
"Oh, yes, sir!" I assured him. "A higher mountain would be
preferred over one nearer the equator. The catapult can be designed to
make up for loss in free ride from Earth's rotation. The difficult thing
is to avoid so far as possible this pesky thick atmosphere. Excuse me,
Doctor; I did not mean to criticize your planet."

"There are higher mountains. Colonel, tell me about this proposed
catapult."
I started to. "The length of an escape-speed catapult is determined
by the acceleration. We think--or the computer calculates--that an
acceleration of twenty gravities is about optimum. For Earth's escape
speed this requires a catapult three hundred twenty-three kilometers in
length. Therefore---"
"Stop, please! Colonel, are you seriously proposing to bore a hole
over three hundred kilometers deep?"
"Oh, no! Construction has to be above ground to permit shock waves
to expand. The stator would stretch nearly horizontally, rising perhaps
four kilometers in three hundred and in a straight line--almost straight,
as Coriolis acceleration and other minor variables make it a gentle
curve. The Lunar catapult is straight so far as the eye can see and so
nearly horizontal that the barges just miss some peaks beyond it."
"Oh. I thought that you were overestimating the capacity of
present-day engineering. We drill deeply today. Not that deeply. Go on."
"Doctor, it may be that common misconception which caused you to
check me is why such a catapult has not been constructed before this.
I've seen those earlier studies. Most assumed that a catapult would be
vertical, or that it would have to tilt up at the end to toss the
spacecraft into the sky--and neither is feasible nor necessary. I suppose
the assumption arose from the fact that your spaceships do boost straight
up, or nearly."
I went on: "But they do that to get above atmosphere, not to get
into orbit. Escape speed is not a vector quantity; it is scalar. A load
bursting from a catapult at escape speed will not return to Earth no
matter what its direction. Uh... two corrections: it must not be headed
toward the Earth itself but at some part of the sky hemisphere, and it
must have enough added velocity to punch through whatever atmosphere it
still traverses. If it is headed in the right direction it will wind up
at Luna."
"Ah, yes. Then this catapult could be used but once each lunar
month?"
"No, sir. On the basis on which you were thinking it would be once
every day, picking the time to fit where Luna will be in her orbit. But
in fact--or so the computer says; I'm not an astronautics expert--in fact
this catapult could be used almost any time, simply by varying ejection
speed, and the orbits could still wind up at Luna."
"I don't visualize that."
"Neither do I, Doctor, but--Excuse me but isn't there an
exceptionally fine computer at Peiping University?"
"And if there is?" (Did I detect an increase in bland
inscrutability? A Cyborg-computer--Pickled brains? Or live ones, aware?
Horrible, either way.)
"Why not ask a topnotch computer for all possible ejection times
for such a catapult as I have described? Some orbits go far outside
Luna's orbit before returning to where they can be captured by Luna,
taking a fantastically long time. Others hook around Terra and then go
quite directly. Some are as simple as the ones we use from Luna. There
are periods each day when short orbits may be selected. But a load is in
the catapult less than one minute; the limitation is how fast the beds
can be made ready. It is even possible to have more than one load going
up the catapult at a time if the power is sufficient and computer control

is versatile. The only thing that worries me is--These high mountains
they are covered with snow?"
"Usually," he answered. "Ice and snow and bare rock."
"Well, sir, being born in Luna I don t know anything about snow.
The stator would not only have to be rigid under the heavy gravity of
this planet but would have to withstand dynamic thrusts at twenty
gravities. I don t suppose it could be anchored to ice or snow. Or could
it be?"
"I'm not an engineer, Colonel, but it seems unlikely. Snow and ice
would have to be removed. And kept clear. Weather would be a problem,
too."
"Weather I know nothing about, Doctor, and all I know about ice is
that it has a heat of crystallization of three hundred thirty-five
million joules per tonne. I have no idea how many tonnes would have to be
melted to clear the site, or how much energy would be required to keep it
clear, but it seems to me that it might take as large a reactor to keep
it free of ice as to power the catapult."
"We can build reactors, we can melt ice. Or engineers can be sent
north for reeducation until they do understand ice." Dr. Chan smiled and
I shivered. "However, the engineering of ice and snow was solved in
Antarctica years ago; don't worry about it. A clear, solid-rock site
about three hundred fifty kilometers long at a high altitude--Anything
else I should know?"
"Not much, sir. Melted ice could be collected near the catapult
head and thus be the most massy part of what will be shipped to Luna-quite a saving. Also the steel canisters would be re-used to ship grain
to Earth, thus stopping another drain that Luna can't take. No reason why
a canister should not make the trip hundreds of times. At Luna it would
be much the way barges are now landed off Bombay, solid-charge
retrorockets programmed by ground control--except that it would be much
cheaper, two and a half kilometer-seconds change of motion versus elevenplus, a squared factor of about twenty--but actually even more favorable,
as retros are parasitic weight and the payload improves accordingly.
There is even a way to improve that."
"How?"
"Doctor, this is outside my specialty. But everybody knows that
your best ships use hydrogen as reaction mass heated by a fusion reactor.
But hydrogen is expensive in Luna and any mass could be reaction mass; it
just would not be as efficient. Can you visualize an enormous, bruteforce space tug designed to fit Lunar conditions? It would use raw rock,
vaporized, as reaction mass and would be designed to go up into parking
orbit, pick up those shipments from Terra, bring them down to Luna's
surface. It would be ugly, all the fancies stripped away--might not be
manned even by a Cyborg. It can be piloted from the ground, by computer."
"Yes, I suppose such a ship could be designed. But let's not
complicate things. Have you covered the essentials about this catapult?"
"I believe so, Doctor. The site is the crucial thing. Take that
peak Nanda Devi. By the maps I have seen it appears to have a long, very
high ridge sloping to the west for about the length of our catapult. If
that is true, it would be ideal--less to cut away, less to bridge. I
don't mean that it is the ideal site but that is the sort to look for: a
very high peak with a long, long ridge west of it."
"I understand." Dr. Chan left abruptly.

Next few weeks I repeated that in a dozen countries, always in
private and with implication that it was secret. All that changed was
name of mountain. In Ecuador I pointed out that Chimborazo was almost on
equator--ideal! But in Argentina I emphasized that their Aconcagua was
highest peak in Western Hemisphere. In Bolivia I noted that Altoplano was
as high as Tibetan Plateau (almost true), much nearer equator, and
offered a wide choice of sites for easy construction leading up to peaks
comparable to any on Terra.
I talked to a North American who was a political opponent of that
choom who had called us "rabble." I pointed out that, while Mount
McKinley was comparable to anything in Asia or South America, there was
much to be said for Mauna Loa--extreme ease of construction. Doubling
gees to make it short enough to fit, and Hawaii would be Spaceport of
World... whole world, for we talked about day when Mars would be
exploited and freight for three (possibly four) planets would channel
through their "Big Island."
Never mentioned Mauna Loa's volcanic nature; instead I noted that
location permitted an aborted load to splash harmlessly in Pacific Ocean.
In Sovunion was only one peak discussed--Lenin, over thousand
meters (and rather too close to their big neighbor).
Kilimanjaro, Popocatepetl, Logan, El Libertado--my favorite peak
changed by country; all that we required was that it be "highest
mountain" in hearts of locals. I found something to say about modest
mountains of Chad when we were entertained there and rationalized so well
I almost believed it.
Other times, with help of leading questions from Stu LaJoie's
stooges, I talked about chemical engineering (of which I know nothing but
had memorized facts) on surface of Luna, where endless free vacuum and
sunpower and limitless raw materials and predictable conditions permitted
ways of processing expensive or impossible Earthside--when day arrived
that cheap shipping both ways made it profitable to exploit Luna's virgin
resources, Was always a suggestion that entrenched bureaucracy of Lunar
Authority had failed to see great potential of Luna (true), plus answer
to a question always asked, which answer asserted that Luna could accept
any number of colonists.
This also was true, although never mentioned that Luna (yes, and
sometimes Luna's Loonies) killed about half of new chums. But people we
talked to rarely thought of emigrating themselves; they thought of
forcing or persuading others to emigrate to relieve crowding--and to
reduce their own taxes. Kept mouth shut about fact that half-fed swarms
we saw everywhere did breed faster than even catapulting could offset.
We could not house, feed, and train even a million new chums each
year--and a million wasn't a drop on Terra; more babies than that were
conceived every night. We could accept far more than would emigrate
voluntarily but if they used forced emigration and flooded us... Luna has
only one way to deal with a new chum: Either he makes not one fatal
mistake, in personal behavior or in coping with environment that will
bite without warning... or he winds up as fertilizer in tunnel farm.
All that immigration in huge numbers could mean would be that a
larger percentage of immigrants would die--too few of us to help them
past natural hazards.
However, Prof did most talking about "Luna's great future." I
talked about catapults.

During weeks we waited for committee to recall us, we covered much
ground. Stu's men had things set up and only question was how much we
could take. Would guess that every week on Terra chopped a year off our
lives, maybe more for Prof. But he never complained and was always ready
to be charming at one more reception.
We spent extra time in North America. Date of our Declaration of
Independence, exactly three hundred years after that of North American
British colonies, turned out to be wizard propaganda and Stu's
manipulators made most of it. North Americans are sentimental about their
"United States" even though it ceased to mean anything once their
continent had been rationalized by F. N. They elect a president every
eight years, why, could not say--why do British still have Queen?--and
boast of being "sovereign."
"Sovereign," like "love," means anything you want it to mean; it's
a word in dictionary between "sober" and "sozzled."
"Sovereignty" meant much in North America and "Fourth of July" was
a magic date; Fourth-of-July League handled our appearances and Stu told
us that it had not cost much to get it moving and nothing to keep going;
League even raised money used elsewhere--North Americans enjoy giving no
matter who gets it.
Farther south Stu used another date; his people planted idea that
coup d'etat had been 5 May instead of two weeks later. We were greeted
with "Cinco de Mayo! Libertad! Cinco de Mayo!" I thought they were
saying, "Thank you"--Prof did all talking.
But in 4th-of-July country I did better. Stu had me quit wearing a
left arm in public, sleeves of my costumes were sewed up so that stump
could not be missed, and word was passed that I had lost it "fighting for
freedom." Whenever I was asked about it, all I did was smile and say,
"See what comes of biting nails?"--then change subject.
I never liked North America, even first trip. It is not most
crowded part of Terra, has a mere billion people. In Bombay they sprawl
on pavements; in Great New York they pack them vertically--not sure
anyone sleeps. Was glad to be in invalid's chair.
Is mixed-up place another way; they care about skin color--by
making point of how they don't care. First trip I was always too light or
too dark, and somehow blamed either way, or was always being expected to
take stand on things I have no opinions on. Bog knows I don't know what
genes I have. One grandmother came from a part of Asia where invaders
passed as regularly as locusts, raping as they went--why not ask her?
Learned to handle it by my second makee-learnee but it left a sour
taste. Think I prefer a place as openly racist as India, where if you
aren't Hindu, you're nobody--except that Parsees look down on Hindus and
vice versa. However I never really had to cope with North America's
reverse-racism when being "Colonel O'Kelly Davis, Hero of Lunar Freedom."
We had swarms of bleeding hearts around us, anxious to help. I let
them do two things for me, things I had never had time, money, or energy
for as a student: I saw Yankees play and i visited Salem.
Should have kept my illusions. Baseball is better over video, you
can really see it and aren't pushed in by two hundred thousand other
people. Besides, somebody should have shot that outfield. I spent most of
that game dreading moment when they would have to get my chair out
through crowd--that and assuring host that I was having a wonderful time.
Salem was just a place, no worse (and no better) than rest of
Boston. After seeing it I suspected they had hanged wrong witches. But

day wasn't wasted; I was filmed laying a wreath on a place where a bridge
had been in another part of Boston, Concord, and made a memorized speech-bridge is still there, actually; you can see it, down through glass. Not
much of a bridge.
Prof enjoyed it all, rough as it was on him: Prof had great
capacity for enjoying. He always had something new to tell about great
future of Luna. In New York he gave managing director of a hotel chain,
one with rabbit trade mark, a sketch of what could be done with resorts
in Luna--once excursion rates were within reach of more people--visits
too short to hurt anyone, escort service included, exotic side trips,
gambling--no taxes.
Last point grabbed attention, so Prof expanded it into "longer old
age" theme--a chain of retirement hostels where an earthworm could live
on Terran old-age pension and go on living, twenty, thirty, forty years
longer than on Terra. As an exile--but which was better? A live old age
in Luna? Or a funeral crypt on Terra? His descendants could pay visits
and fill those resort hotels. Prof embellished with pictures of
"nightclubs" with acts impossible in Terra's horrible gravity, sports to
fit our decent level of gravitation--even talked about swimming pools and
ice skating and possibility of flying! (Thought he had tripped his
safeties.) He finished by hinting that Swiss cartel had tied it up.
Next day he was telling foreign-divisions manager of Chase
International Panagra that a Luna City branch should be staffed with
paraplegics, paralytics, heart cases, amputees, others who found high
gravity a handicap. Manager was a fat man who wheezed, he may have been
thinking of it personally--but his ears pricked up at "no taxes."
We didn't have it all our own way. News was often against us and
were always hecklers. Whenever I had to take them on without Prof's help
I was likely to get tripped. One man tackled me on Prof's statement to
committee that we "owned" grain grown in Luna: he seemed to take it for
granted that we did not. Told him I did not understand question.
He answered, "Isn't it true, Colonel, that your provisional
government has asked for membership in Federated Nations?"
Should have answered, "No comment." But fell for it and agreed.
"Very well," he said, "the impediment seems to be the counterclaim that
the Moon belongs to the Federated Nations--as it always has---under
supervision of the Lunar Authority. Either way, by your own admission,
that grain belongs to the Federated Nations, in trust."
I asked how he reached that conclusion? He answered, 'Colonel, you
style yourself 'Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs.' Surely you are
familiar with the charter of the Federated Nations."
I had skimmed it. "Reasonably familiar," I said--cautiously, I
thought.
"Then you know the First Freedom guaranteed by the Charter and its
current application through F & A Control Board Administrative Order
Number eleven-seventy-six dated three March of this year. You concede
therefore that all grain grown on the Moon in excess of the local ration
is ab initio and beyond contest the property of all, title held in trust
by the Federated Nations through its agencies for distribution as
needed." He was writing as he talked. "Have you anything to add to that
concession?"
I said, "What in Bog's name you talking about?" Then, "Come back!
Haven't conceded anything!"

So Great New York Times printed: LUNAR "UNDERSECRETARY" SAYS:
"FOOD BELONGS TO HUNGRY"
New York Today--O'Kelly Davis, soi-disant "Colonel of the Armed
Forces of Free Luna" here on a junket to stir up support for the
insurgents in the F. N. Lunar colonies, said in a voluntary statement to
this paper that the "Freedom from Hunger" clause in the Grand Charter
applied to the Lunar grain shipments-- I asked Prof how should have
handled? "Always answer an unfriendly question with another question," he
told me. "Never ask him to clarify; he'll put words in your mouth. This
reporter--Was he skinny? Ribs showing?"
"No. Heavyset."
"Not living on eighteen hundred calories a day, I take it, which is
the subject of that order he cited. Had you known you could have asked
him how long he had conformed to the ration and why he quit? Or asked him
what he had for breakfast--and then looked unbelieving no matter what he
answered. Or when you don't know what a man is getting at, let your
counter-question shift the subject to something you do want to talk
about. Then, no matter what he answers, make your point and call on
someone else. Logic does not enter into it--just tactics."
"Prof, nobody here is living on eighteen hundred calories a day.
Bombay, maybe. Not here."
"Less than that in Bombay. Manuel, that 'equal ration' is a
fiction. Half the food on this planet is in the black market, or is not
reckoned through one ruling or another. Or they keep two sets of books,
and figures submitted to the F. N. having nothing to do with the economy.
Do you think that grain from Thailand and Burma and Australia is
correctly reported to the Control Board by Great China? I'm sure that the
India representative on that food board doesn't. But India keeps quiet
because she gets the lion's share from Luna... and then 'plays politics
with hunger'--a phrase you may remember--by using our grain to control
her elections. Kerala had a planned famine last year. Did you see it in
the news?"
"No."
"Because it wasn't in the news. A managed democracy is a wonderful
thing, Manuel, for the managers... and its greatest strength is a 'free
press' when 'free' is defined as 'responsible' and the managers define
what is 'irresponsible.' Do you know what Luna needs most?"
"More ice."
"A news system that does not bottleneck through one channel. Our
friend Mike is our greatest danger."
"Huh? Don't you trust Mike?"
"Manuel, on some subjects I don't trust even myself. Limiting the
freedom of news 'just a little bit' is in the same category with the
classic example 'a little bit pregnant.' We are not yet free nor will we
be as long as anyone--even our ally Mike--controls our news. Someday I
hope to own a newspaper independent of any source or channel. I would
happily set print by hand, like Benjamin Franklin."
I gave up. "Prof, suppose these talks fail and grain shipments
stop. What happens?"
"People back home will be vexed with us... and many here on Terra
would die. Have you read Malthus?"
"Don't think so."
"Many would die. Then a new stability would be reached with
somewhat more people--more efficient people and better fed. This planet

isn't crowded; it is just mismanaged... and the unkindest thing you can
do for a hungry man is to give him food. 'Give.' Read Malthus. It is
never safe to laugh at Dr. Malthus; he always has the last laugh. A
depressing man, I'm glad he's dead. But don't read him until this is
over; too many facts hamper a diplomat, especially an honest one."
"I'm not especially honest."
"But you have no talent for dishonesty, so your refuge must be
ignorance and stubbornness. You have the latter; try to preserve the
former. For the nonce. Lad, Uncle Bernardo is terribly tired."
I said, "Sorry," and wheeled out of his room. Prof was hitting too
hard a pace. I would have been willing to quit if would insure his
getting into a ship and out of that gravity. But traffic stayed one way-grain barges, naught else.
But Prof had fun. As I left and waved lights out, noticed again a
toy he had bought, one that delighted him like a kid on Christmas--a
brass cannon.
A real one from sailing ship days. Was small, barrel about half a
meter long and massing, with wooden carriage, only kilos fifteen. A
"signal gun" its papers said. Reeked of ancient history, pirates, men
"walking plank." A pretty thing but I asked Prof why? If we ever managed
to leave, price to lift that mass to Luna would hurt--I was resigned to
abandoning a p-suit with years more wear in it--abandon everything but
two left arms and a pair of shorts, If pressed, might give up social arm.
If very pressed, would skip shorts.
He reached out and stroked shiny barrel. "Manuel, once there was a
man who held a political make-work job like so many here in this
Directorate, shining brass cannon around a courthouse."
"Why would courthouse have cannon?"
"Never mind. He did this for years. It fed him and let him save a
bit, but he was not getting ahead in the world. So one day he quit his
job, drew out his savings, bought a brass cannon--and went into business
for himself."
"Sounds like idiot."
"No doubt. And so were we, when we tossed out the Warden. Manuel,
you'll outlive me. When Luna adopts a flag, I would like it to be a
cannon or, on field sable, crossed by bar sinister gules of our proudly
ignoble lineage. Do you think it could be managed?"
"Suppose so, if you'll sketch. But why a flag? Not a flagpole in
all Luna."
"It can fly in our hearts... a symbol for all fools so ridiculously
impractical as to think they can fight city hail. Will you remember,
Manuel?"
"Sure. That is, will remind you when time comes." Didn't like such
talk. He had started using oxygen tent in private--and would not use in
public.
Guess I'm "ignorant" and "stubborn"--was both in place called
Lexington, Kentucky, in Central Managerial Area. One thing no doctrine
about, no memorized answers, was life in Luna. Prof said to tell truth
and emphasize homely, warm, friendly things, especially anything
different. "Remember, Manuel, the thousands of Terrans who have made
short visits to Luna are only a tiny fraction of one percent. To most
people we will be as weirdly interesting as strange animals in a zoo. Do
you remember that turtle on exhibition in Old Dome? That's us."

Certainly did; they wore that insect out, staring at. So when this
male-female team started quizzing about family life in Luna was happy to
answer. I prettied it only by what I left out--things that aren't family
life but poor substitutes in a community overloaded with males, Luna City
is homes and families mainly, dull by Terra standards--but I like it. And
other warrens much same, people who work and raise kids and gossip and
find most of their fun around dinner table. Not much to tell, so I
discussed anything they found interesting. Every Luna custom comes from
Terra since that's where we all came from, but Terra is such a big place
that a custom from Micronesia, say, may be strange in North America.
This woman--can't call her lady--wanted to know about various sorts
of marriage. First, was it true that one could get married without a
license "on" Luna?
I asked what a marriage license was?
Her companion said, "Skip it, Mildred. Pioneer societies never have
marriage licenses."
"But don't you keep records?" she persisted.
"Certainly," I agreed. "My family keeps a family book that goes
back almost to first landing at Johnson City--every marriage, birth,
death, every event of importance not only in direct line but all branches
so far as we can keep track. And besides, is a man, a schoolteacher,
going around copying old family records all over our warren, writing a
history of Luna City. Hobby."
"But don't you have official records? Here in Kaintucky we have
records that go back hundreds of years."
"Madam, we haven't lived there that long."
"Yes, but--Well, Luna City must have a city clerk. Perhaps you call
him 'county recorder.' The official who keeps track of such things. Deeds
and so forth."
I said. "Don't think so, madam. Some bookies do notary work,
witnessing chops on contracts, keeping records of them. Is for people who
don't read and write and can't keep own records. But never heard of one
asked to keep record of marriage. Not saying couldn't happen. But haven't
heard."
"How delightfully informal! Then this other rumor, about how simple
it is to get a divorce on the Moon. I daresay that's true, too?"
"No, madam, wouldn't say divorce is simple. Too much to untangle.
Mmm... take a simple example, one lady and say she has two husbands--"
"Two?"
"Might have more, might have just one. Or might be complex
marriage. But let's take one lady and two men as typical. She decides to
divorce one. Say it's friendly, with other husband agreeing and one she
is getting rid of not making fuss. Not that it would do him any good.
Okay, she divorces him; he leaves. Still leaves endless things. Men might
be business partners, co-husbands often are. Divorce may break up
partnership. Money matters to settle. This three may own cubic together,
and while will be in her name, ex-husband probably has cash coming or
rent. And almost always are children to consider, support and so forth.
Many things. No, madam, divorce is never simple. Can divorce him in ten
seconds but may take ten years to straighten out loose ends. Isn't it
much that way here?"
"Uh... just fuhget ah evah asked the question, Cunn'l; it may be
simpluh hyuh." (She did talk that way but was understandable once I got

program. Won't spell it again.) "But if that is a simple marriage, what
is a 'complex' one?"
Found self explaining polyandries, clans, groups, lines, and less
common patterns considered vulgar by conservative people such as my own
family--deal my mother set up, say, after she ticked off my old man,
though didn't describe that one; Mother was always too extreme.
Woman said, "You have me confused. What is the difference between a
line and a clan?"
Are quite different. Take own case. I have honor to be member of
one of oldest line marriages in Luna--and, in my prejudiced opinion,
best. You asked about divorce. Our family has never had one and would bet
long odds never will. A line marriage increases in stability year after
year, gains practice in art of getting along together, until notion of
anybody leaving is unthinkable. Besides, takes unanimous decision of all
wives to divorce a husband--could never happen. Senior wife would never
let it get that far."
Went on describing advantages--financial security, fine home life
it gives children, fact that death of a spouse, while tragic, could never
be tragedy it was in a temporary family, especially for children-children simply could not be orphaned. Suppose I waxed too enthusiastic-but my family is most important thing in my life. Without them I'm just
one-armed mechanic who could be eliminated without causing a draft.
"Here's why is stable," I said. "Take my youngest wife, sixteen.
Likely be in her eighties before is senior wife. Doesn't mean all wives
senior to her will die by then; unlikely in Luna, females seem to be
immortal. But may all opt out of family management by then; by our family
traditions they usually do, without younger wives putting pressure on
them. So Ludmilla--"
"Ludmilla?"
"Russki name. From fairy tale. Milla will have over fifty years of
good example before has to carry burden. She's sensible to start with,
not likely to make mistakes and if did, has other wives to steady her.
Self-correcting, like a machine with proper negative feedback. A good
line marriage is immortal; expect mine to outlast me at least a thousand
years--and is why shan't mind dying when time comes; best part of me will
go on living."
Prof was being wheeled out; he had them stop stretcher cart and
listened. I turned to him. "Professor," I said, "you know my family.
Would mind telling this lady why it's a happy family? If you think so."
"It is," agreed Prof. "However, I would rather make a more general
remark. Dear madam, I gather that you find our Lunar marriage customs
somewhat exotic."
"Oh, I wouldn't go that far!" she said hastily. "Just somewhat
unusual."
"They arise, as marriage customs always do, from economic
necessities of the circumstances--and our circumstances are very
different from those here on Earth. Take the line type of marriage which
my colleague has been praising.. and justifiably, I assure you, despite
his personal bias--I am a bachelor and have no bias. Line marriage is the
strongest possible device for conserving capital and insuring the welfare
of children--the two basic societal functions for marriage everywhere--in
an environment in which there is no security, neither for capital nor for
children, other than that devised by individuals. Somehow human beings
always cope with their environments. Line marriage is a remarkably

successful invention to that end. All other Lunar forms of marriage serve
that same purpose, though not as well."
He said goodnight and left. I had with me--always!--a picture of my
family, newest one, our wedding with Wyoming. Brides are at their
prettiest and Wyoh was radiant--and rest of us looked handsome and happy,
with Grandpaw tall and proud and not showing failing faculties.
But was disappointed; they looked at it oddly. But man --Mathews,
name was--said, "Can you spare this picture, Colonel?"
Winced. "Only copy I have. And a long way from home."
"For a moment, I mean. Let me have it photographed. Right here, it
need never leave your hands,"
"Oh. Oh, certainly!" Not a good picture of me but is face I have,
and did Wyoh justice and they just don't come prettier than Lenore.
So he photographed it and next morning they did come right into our
hotel suite and woke me before time and did arrest and take me away wheel
chair and all and did lock me in a cell with bars! For bigamy. For
polygamy. For open immorality and publicly inciting others to same.
Was glad Mum couldn't see.

19
Took Stu all day to get case transferred to an F. N. court and dismissed.
His lawyers asked to have it tossed out on "diplomatic immunity" but F.
N. judges did not fall into trap, merely noted that alleged offenses had
taken place outside jurisdiction of lower court, except alleged
"inciting" concerning which they found insufficient evidence. Aren't any
F. N. laws covering marriage; can't be--just a rule about each nation
required to give "full faith and credence" to marriage customs of other
member nations.
Out of those eleven billion people perhaps seven billion lived
where polygamy is legal, and Stu's opinion manipulators played up
"persecution"; it gained us sympathy from people who otherwise would
never have heard of us--even gained it in North America and other places
where polygamy is not legal, from people who believe in "live and let
live." All good, because always problem was to be noticed. To most of
those bee-swarm billions Luna was nothing; our rebellion hadn't been
noticed.
Stu's operators had gone to much thought to plan setup to get me
arrested. Was not told until weeks later after time to cool off and see
benefits. Took a stupid judge, a dishonest sheriff, and barbaric local
prejudice which I triggered with that sweet picture, for Stu admitted
later that range of color in Davis family was what got judge angry enough
to be foolish even beyond native talent for nonsense.
My one consolation, that Mum could not see my disgrace, turned out
mistaken; pictures, taken through bars and showing grim face, were in
every Luna paper, and write-ups used nastiest Earthside stories, not
larger number that deplored injustice. But should have had more faith in
Mimi; she wasn't ashamed, simply wanted to go Earthside and rip some
people to pieces.

While helped Earthside, greatest good was in Luna. Loonies become
more unified over this silly huhu than had ever been before. They took it
personally and "Adam Selene" and "Simon Jester" pushed it. Loonies are
easygoing except on one subject, women. Every lady felt insulted by
Terran news stories--so male Loonies who had ignored politics suddenly
discovered I was their boy.
Spin-off--old lags feel superior to those not transported. Later
found self greeted by ex-cons with: "Hi, jailbird!" A lodge greeting--I
was accepted.
But saw nothing good about it then! Pushed around, treated like
cattle, fingerprinted, photographed, given food we wouldn't offer hogs,
exposed to endless indignity, and only that heavy field kept me from
trying to kill somebody--had I been wearing number-six arm when grabbed,
might have tried.
But steadied down once I was freed. Hour later we were on way to
Agra; had at last been summoned by committee. Felt good to be back in
suite in maharajah's palace but eleven-hour zone change in less than
three did not permit rest; we went to hearing bleary-eyed and held
together by drugs.
"Hearing" was one-sided; we listened while chairman talked. Talked
an hour; I'll summarize: Our preposterous claims were rejected. Lunar
Authority's sacred trust could not be abandoned. Disorders on Earth's
Moon could not be tolerated. Moreover, recent disorders showed that
Authority had been too lenient. Omission was now to be corrected by an
activist program, a five-year plan in which all phases of life in
Authority's trusteeship would be overhauled. A code of laws was being
drafted; civil and criminal courts would be instituted for benefit of
"client-employees"--which meant all persons in trust area, not just
consignees with uncompleted sentences. Public schools would be
established, plus indoctrinal adult schools for client-employees in need
of same. An economic, engineering, and agricultural planning board would
be created to provide fullest and most efficient use of Moon's resources
and labor of client-employees. An interim goal of quadrupling grain
shipments in five years had been adopted as a figure easily obtainable
once scientific planning of resources and labor was in effect. First
phase would be to withdraw client-employees from occupations found not to
be productive and put them to drilling a vast new system of farm tunnels
in order that hydroponics would commence in them not later than March
2078. These new giant farms would be operated by Lunar Authority,
scientifically, and not left to whims of private owners. It was
contemplated that this system would, by end of five-year plan, produce
entire new grain quota; in meantime client-employees producing grain
privately would be allowed to continue. But they would be absorbed into
new system as their less efficient methods were no longer needed.
Chairman looked up from papers. "In short, the Lunar colonies are
going to be civilized and brought into managerial coordination with the
rest of civilization. Distasteful as this task has been, I feel--speaking
as a citizen rather than as chairman of this committee--I feel that we
owe you thanks for bringing to our attention a situation so badly in need
of correction."
Was ready to burn his ears off. "Client-employees!" What a fancy
way to say "slaves"! But Prof said tranquilly, "I find the proposed plans
most interesting. Is one permitted to ask questions? Purely for
information?"

"For information, yes."
North American member leaned forward. "But don't assume that we are
going to take any backtalk from you cavemen! So mind your manners. You
aren't in the clear on this, you know."
"Order," chairman said. "Proceed, Professor."
"This term 'client-employee' I find intriguing. Can it be
stipulated that the majority of inhabitants of Earth's major satellite
are not undischarged consignees but free individuals?"
"Certainly," chairman agreed blandly. "All legal aspects of the new
policy have been studied. With minor exceptions some ninety-one percent
of the colonists have citizenship, original or derived, in various member
nations of the Federated Nations. Those who wish to return to their home
countries have a right to do so. You will be pleased to learn that the
Authority is considering a plan under which loans for transportation can
be arranged... probably under supervision of International Red Cross and
Crescent. I might add that I myself am heartily backing this plan--as it
renders nonsensical any talk about 'slave labor.'" He smiled smugly.
"I see," agreed Prof. "Most humane. Has the committee--or the
Authority--pondered the fact that most--effectively all, I should say-considered the fact that inhabitants of Luna are physically unable to
live on this planet? That they have undergone involuntary permanent exile
through irreversible physiological changes and can never again live in
comfort and health in a gravitational field six times greater than that
to which their bodies have become adjusted?"
Scoundrel pursed lips as if considering totally new idea. "Speaking
again for myself, I would not be prepared to stipulate that what you say
is necessarily true. It might be true of some, might not be others;
people vary widely. Your presence here proves that it is not impossible
for a Lunar inhabitant to return to Earth. In any case we have no
intention of forcing anyone to return. We hope that they will choose to
stay and we hope to encourage others to emigrate to the Moon. But these
are individual choices, under the freedoms guaranteed by the Great
Charter. But as to this alleged physiological phenomenon--it is not a
legal matter. If anyone deems it prudent, or thinks he would be happier,
to stay on the Moon, that's his privilege."
"I see, sir. We are free. Free to remain in Luna and work, at tasks
and for wages set by you... or free to return to Earth to die."
Chairman shrugged. "You assume that we are villians--we're not.
Why, if I were a young man I would emigrate to the Moon myself. Great
opportunities! In any case I am not troubled by your distortions--history
will justify us."
Was surprised at Prof; he was not fighting. Worried about him-weeks of strain and a bad night on top. All he said was, "Honorable
Chairman, I assume that shipping to Luna will soon be resumed. Can
passage be arranged for my colleague and myself in the first ship? For I
must admit, sir, that this gravitational weakness of which I spoke is, in
our cases, very real. Our mission is completed; we need to go home."
(Not a word about grain barges. Nor about "throwing rocks," nor
even futility of beating a cow. Prof just sounded tired.)
Chairman leaned forward and spoke with grim satisfaction.
"Professor, that presents difficulties. To put it bluntly, you appear to
be guilty of treason against the Great Charter, indeed against all
humanity... and an indictment is being considered. I doubt if anything
more than a suspended sentence would be invoked against a man of your age

and physical condition, however. Do you think it would be prudent of us
to give you passage back to the place where you committed these acts-there to stir up more mischief?"
Prof sighed. "I understand your point. Then, sir, may I be excused?
I am weary."
"Certainly. Hold yourself at the disposal of this committee. The
hearing stands adjourned. Colonel Davis--"
"Sir?" I was directing wheel chair around, to get Prof out at once;
our attendants had been sent outside.
"A word with you, please. In my office."
"Uh--" Looked at Prof; eyes were closed and seemed unconscious. But
he moved one finger, motioning me to him. "Honorable Chairman, I'm more
nurse than diplomat; have to look after him. He's an old man, he's ill."
"The attendants will take care of him."
"Well..." Got as close to Prof as I could from chair, leaned over
him. "Prof, are you right?"
He barely whispered. "See what he wants. Agree with him. But
stall."
Moments later was alone with chairman, soundproof door locked-meant nothing; room could have a dozen ears, plus one in my left arm.
He said, "A drink? Coffee?"
I answered, "No, thank you, sir. Have to watch my diet here."
"I suppose so. Are you really limited to that chair? You look
healthy."
I said, "I could, if had to, get up and walk across room. Might
faint. Or worse. Prefer not to risk. Weigh six times what I should.
Heart's not used to it."
"I suppose so. Colonel, I hear you had some silly trouble in North
America. I'm sorry, I truly am. Barbaric place. Always hate to have to go
there. I suppose you're wondering why I wanted to see you."
"No, sir, assume you'll tell when suits you. Instead was wondering
why you still call me 'Colonel.'"
He gave a barking laugh. "Habit, I suppose. A lifetime of protocol.
Yet it might be well for you to continue with that title. Tell me, what
do you think of our five-year plan?"
Thought it stunk. "Seems to have been carefully thought out."
"Much thought went into it. Colonel, you seem to be a sensible man-I know you are, I know not only your background but practically every
word you've spoken, almost your thoughts, ever since you set foot on
Earth. You were born on the Moon. Do you regard yourself as a patriot? Of
the Moon?"
"Suppose so. Though tend to think of what we did just as something
that had to be done."
"Between ourselves--yes. That old fool Hobart. Colonel, that is a
good plan... but lacks an executive. If you are really a patriot or let's
say a practical man with your country's best interests at heart, you
might be the man to carry it out." He held up hand. "Don't be hasty! I'm
not asking you to sell out, turn traitor, or any nonsense like that. This
is your chance to be a real patriot--not some phony hero who gets himself
killed in a lost cause. Put it this way. Do you think it is possible for
the Lunar colonies to hold out against all the force that the Federated
Nations of Earth can bring to bear? You're not really a military man, I
know--and I'm glad you're not--but you are a technical man, and I know

that, too. In your honest estimation, how many ships and bombs do you
think it would take to destroy the Lunar colonies?"
I answered, "One ship, six bombs."
"Correct! My God, it's good to talk to a sensible man. Two of them
would have to be awf'ly big, perhaps specially built. A few people would
stay alive, for a while, in smaller warrens beyond the blast areas. But
one ship would do it, in ten minutes."
I said, "Conceded, sir, but Professor de la Paz pointed out that
you don't get milk by beating a cow. And certainly can't by shooting it."
"Why do you think we've held back, done nothing, for over a month?
That idiot colleague of mine--I won't name him--spoke of 'backtalk.'
Backtalk doesn't fret me; it's just talk and I'm interested in results.
No, my dear Colonel, we won't shoot the cow... but we would, if forced
to, let the cow know that it could be shot. H-missiles are expensive toys
but we could afford to expend some as warning shots, wasted on bare rock
to let the cow know what could happen. But that is more force than one
likes to use--it might frighten the cow and sour its milk." He gave
another barking laugh. "Better to persuade old bossy to give down
willingly."
I waited. "Don't you want to know how?" he asked.
"How?" I agreed.
"Through you. Don't say a word and let me explain--"
He took me up on that high mountain and offered me kingdoms of
Earth. Or of Luna. Take job of "Protector Pro Tem" with understanding was
mine permanently if I could deliver. Convince Loonies they could not win.
Convince them that this new setup was to their advantage--emphasize
benefits, free schools, free hospitals, free this and that--details later
but an everywhere government just like on Terra. Taxes starting low and
handled painlessly by automatic checkoff and through kickback revenues
from grain shipments. But, most important, this time Authority would not
send a boy to do a man's job--two regiments of police at once.
"Those damned Peace Dragoons were a mistake," he said, "one we
won't make again. Between ourselves, the reason it has taken us a month
to work this out is that we had to convince the Peace Control Commission
that a handful of men cannot police three million people spread through
six largish warrens and fifty and more small ones. So you'll start with
enough police--not combat troops but military police used to quelling
civilians with a minimum of fuss. Besides that, this time they'll have
female auxiliaries, the standard ten per cent-no more rape complaints.
Well, sir? Think you can swing it? Knowing it's best in the long run for
your own people?"
I said I ought to study it in detail, particularly plans and quotas
for five-year plan, rather than make snap decision.
~Certainly, certainly!" he agreed. "I'll give you a copy of the
white paper we've made up; take it home, study it, sleep on it. Tomorrow
we'll talk again. Just give me your word as a gentleman to keep it under
your hair. No secret, really... but these things are best settled before
they are publicized. Speaking of publicity, you'll need help--and you'll
get it. We'll go to the expense of sending up topnotch men, pay them what
it's worth, have them centrifuge the way those scientists do--you know.
This time we're doing it right. That fool Hobart--he's actually dead,
isn't he?"
"No, sir. Senile, however."
"Should have killed him, Here's your
copy of the plan."

"Sir? Speaking of old men--Professor de la Paz can't stay here.
Wouldn't live six months."
"That's best, isn't it?"
I tried to answer levelly, "You don't understand. He is greatly
loved and respected. Best thing would be for me to convince him that you
mean business with those H-missiles--and that it is his patriotic duty to
salvage what we can. But, either way, if I return without him... well,
not only could not swing it; wouldn't live long enough to try."
"Hmm--Sleep on it. We'll talk tomorrow. Say fourteen o'clock."
I left and as soon as was loaded into lorry gave way to shakes.
Just don't have high-level approach.
Stu was waiting with Prof. "Well?" said Prof.
I glanced around, tapped ear. We huddled, heads over Prof's head
and two blankets over us all. Stretcher wagon was clean and so was my
chair; I checked them each morning. But for room itself seemed safer to
whisper under blankets.
Started in. Prof stopped me. "Discuss his ancestry and habits
later. The facts."
"He offered me job of Warden."
"I trust you accepted."
"Ninety percent. I'm to study this garbage and give answer
tomorrow. Stu, how fast can we execute Plan Scoot?"
"Started. We were waiting for you to return. If they let you
return."
Next fifty minutes were busy. Stu produced a gaunt Hindu in a
dhoti; in thirty minutes he was a twin of Prof, and lifted Prof off wagon
onto a divan. Duplicating me was easier. Our doubles were wheeled into
suite's living room just at dusk and dinner was brought in. Several
people came and went --among them elderly Hindu woman in sari, on arm of
Stuart LaJoie. A plump babu followed them.
Getting Prof up steps to roof was worst; he had never worn powered
walkers, had no chance to practice, and had been flat on back for more
than a month.
But Stu's arm kept him steady; I gritted teeth and climbed those
thirteen terrible steps by myself. By time I reached roof, heart was
ready to burst. Was put to it not to black out. A silent little flitter
craft came out of gloom right on schedule and ten minutes later we were
in chartered ship we had used past month--two minutes after that we
jetted for Australia. Don't know what it cost to prepare this dance and
keep it ready against need, but was no hitch.
Stretched out by Prof and caught breath, then said, "How you feel,
Prof?"
"Okay. A bit tired. Frustrated."
"Ja da. Frustrated."
"Over not seeing the Taj Mahal, I mean. I never had opportunity as
a young man--and here I've been within a kilometer of it twice, once for
several days, now for another day... and still I haven't seen it and
never shall."
"Just a tomb."
"And Helen of Troy was just a woman. Sleep, lad." We landed in
Chinee half of Australia, place called Darwin, and were carried straight
into a ship, placed in acceleration couches and dosed. Prof was already
out and I was beginning to feel dopy when Stu came in, grinned, and
strapped down by us. I looked at him. "You, too? Who's minding shop?"

"The same people who've been doing the real work all along. It's a
good setup and doesn't need me any longer. Mannie old cobber, I did not
want to be marooned a long way from home. Luna, I mean, in case you have
doubts. This looks like the last train from Shanghai."
"What's Shanghai got to do with?"
"Forget I mentioned it. Mannie, I'm flat broke, concave. I owe
money in all directions--debts that will be paid only if certain stocks
move the way Adam Selene convinced me they would move, shortly after this
point in history. And I'm wanted, or will be, for offenses against the
public peace and dignity. Put it this way. I'm saving them the trouble of
transporting me. Do you think I can learn to be a drillman at my age?"
Was feeling foggy, drug taking hold. "Stu, in Luna y'aren't old...
barely started... 'nyway.., eat our table f'ever! Mimi likes you."
"Thanks, cobber, I might. Warning light! Deep breath!"
Suddenly was kicked by ten gee.

20
Our craft was ground-to-orbit ferry type used for manned satellites, for
supplying F. N. ships in patrol orbit, and for passengers to and from
pleasure-and-gambling satellites. She was carrying three passengers
instead of forty, no cargo except three p-suits and a brass cannon (yes,
silly toy was along; p-suits and Prof's bang-bang were in Australia a
week before we were) and good ship Lark had been stripped--total crew was
skipper and a Cyborg pilot.
She was heavily overfueled.
We made (was told) normal approach on Elysium satellite... then
suddenly scooted from orbital speed to escape speed, a change even more
violent than liftoff.
This was scanned by F. N. Skytrack; we were commanded to stop and
explain. I got this secondhand from Stu, self still recovering and
enjoying luxury of no-gee with one strap to anchor. Prof was still out.
"So they want to know who we are and what we think we are doing,"
Stu told me. "We told them that we were Chinese registry sky wagon
Opening Lotus bound on an errand of mercy, to wit, rescuing those
scientists marooned on the Moon, and gave our identification--as Opening
Lotus."
"How about transponder?"
"Mannie, if I got what I paid for, our transponder identified us as
the Lark up to ten minutes ago. . . and now has I. D.'d us as the Lotus.
Soon we will know. Just one ship is in position to get a missile off and
it must blast us in"--he stopped to look--"another twenty-seven minutes
according to the wired-up gentleman booting this bucket, or its chances
of getting us are poor to zero. So if it worries you--if you have prayers
to say or messages to send or whatever it is one does at such times--now
is the time."
"Think we ought to rouse Prof?"
"Let him sleep. Can you think of a better way to make jump than
from peaceful sleep instantaneously into a cloud of radiant gas? Unless

you know that he has religious necessities to attend to? He never struck
me as a religious man, orthodoctrinally speaking."
"He's not. But if you have such duties, don't let me keep you."
"Thank you, I took care of what seemed necessary before we left
ground. How about yourself, Mannie? I'm not much of a padre but I'll do
my best, if I can help. Any sins on your mind, old cobber? If you need to
confess, I know quite a little about sin."
Told him my needs did not run that way. Then did recall sins, some
I cherished, and gave him a version more or less true. That reminded him
of some of his own, which remind me--Zero time came and went before we
ran out of sins. S LaJoie is a good person to spend last minutes with,
even if don't turn out to be last.
We had two days with naught to do but undergo drastic routines to
keep us from carrying umpteen plagues to Luna. But didn't mind shaking
from induced chills and burning with fever; free fall was such a relief
and was so happy to be going home.
Or almost happy--Prof asked what was troubling me,~ "Nothing," I
said. "Can't wait to be home. But--Truth is, ashamed to show face after
we've failed. Prof, what did we do wrong?"
"Failed, my boy?"
"Don't see what else can call it. Asked to be recognized. Not what
we got."
"Manuel, I owe you an apology. You will recall Adam Selene's
projection of our chances just before we left home." Stu was not in
earshot but "Mike" was word we never used; was always "Adam Selene" for
security.
"Certainly do! One in fifty-three. Then when we reached Earthside
dropped to reeking one in hundred. What you guess it is now? One in
thousand?"
"I've had new projections every few days. . . which is why I owe
you an apology. The last, received just before we left, included the
then-untested assumption that we would escape, get clear of Terra and
home safely. Or that at least one of us three would make it, which is why
Comrade Stu was summoned home, he having a Terran's tolerance of high
acceleration. Eight projections, in fact, ranging from three of us dead,
through various combinations up to three surviving. Would you care to
stake a few dollars on what that last projection is, setting a bracket
and naming your own odds? I'll give a hint. You are far too pessimistic."
"Uh... no, damn it! Just tell."
"The odds against us are now only seventeen to one... and they've
been shortening all month. Which I couldn't tell you."
"Was amazed, delighted, overjoyed--hurt. "What you mean, couldn't
tell me? Look, Prof, if not trusted, deal me out and put Stu in executive
cell."
"Please, son. That's where he will go if anything happens to any of
us--you, me, or dear Wyoming. I could not tell you Earthside--and can
tell you now--not because you aren't trusted but because you are no
actor. You could carry out your role more effectively if you believed
that our purpose was to achieve recognition of independence."
"Now he tells!"
"Manuel, Manuel, we had to fight hard every instant--and lose."
"So? Am big enough boy to be told?"
"Please, Manuel. Keeping you temporarily in the dark greatly
enhanced our chances; you can check this with Adam. May I add that Stuart

accepted his summons to Luna blithely without asking why? Comrade, that
committee was too small, its chairman too intelligent; there was always
the hazard that they might offer an acceptable compromise--that first day
there was grave danger of it. Had we been able to force our case before
the Grand Assembly there would have been no danger of intelligent action.
But we were balked. The best I could do was to antagonize the committee,
even stooping to personal insult to make certain of at least one holdout
against common sense."
"Guess I never will understand high-level approach."
"Possibly not. But your talents and mine complement each other.
Manuel, you wish to see Luna free."
"You know I do."
"You also know that Terra can defeat us."
"Sure. No projection ever gave anything close to even money. So
don't see why you set out to antagonize--"
"Please. Since they can inflict their will on us, our only chance
lies in weakening their will. That was why we had to go to Terra. To be
divisive. To create many opinions. The shrewdest of the great generals in
China's history once said that perfection in war lay in so sapping the
opponent's will that he surrenders without fighting. In that maxim lies
both our ultimate purpose and our most pressing danger. Suppose, as
seemed possible that first day, we had been offered an inviting
compromise. A governor in place of a warden, possibly from our own
number. Local autonomy. A delegate in the Grand Assembly. A higher price
for grain at the catapult head, plus a bonus for increased shipments. A
disavowal of Hobart's policies combined with an expression of regret over
the rape and the killings with handsome cash settlements to the victims'
survivors. Would it have been accepted? Back home?"
"They did not offer that."
"The chairman was ready to offer something like it that first
afternoon and at that time he had his committee in hand. He offered us an
asking price close enough to permit such a dicker. Assume that we reached
in substance what I outlined. Would it have been acceptable at home?"
"Uh... maybe."
"More than a 'maybe' by the bleak projection made just before we
left home; it was the thing to be avoided at any cost--a settlement which
would quiet things down, destroy our will to resist, without changing any
essential in the longer-range prediction of disaster. So I switched the
subject and squelched possibility by being difficult about irrelevancies
politely offensive. Manuel, you and I know--and Adam knows--that there
must be an end to food shipments; nothing less will save Luna from
disaster. But can you imagine a wheat farmer fighting to end those
shipments?"
"No. Wonder if can pick up news from home on how they're taking
stoppage?"
"There won't be any. Here is how Adam has timed it, Manuel: No
announcement is to be made on either planet until after we get home. We
are still buying wheat. Barges are still arriving at Bombay."
"You told them shipments would stop at once."
"That was a threat, not a moral commitment. A few more loads won't
matter and we need time. We don't have everyone on our side; we have only
a minority. There is a majority who don't care either way but can be
swayed--temporarily. We have another minority against us... especially
grain farmers whose interest is never politics but the price of wheat.

They are grumbling but accepting Scrip, hoping it will be worth face
value later. But the instant we announce that shipments have stopped they
will be actively against us. Adam plans to have the majority committed to
us at the time the announcement is made."
"How long? One year? Two?"
"Two days, three days, perhaps four. Carefully edited excerpts from
that five-year plan, excerpts from the recordings you've made-especially
that yellow-dog offer--exploitation of your arrest in Kentucky--"
"Hey! I'd rather forget that."
Prof smiled and cocked an eyebrow. "Uh--" I said uncomfortably.
"Okay. If will help."
"It will help more than any statistics about natural resources."
Wired-up ex-human piloting us went in as one maneuver without
bothering to orbit and gave us even heavier beating; ship was light and
lively. But change in motion is under two-and-a-half kilometers; was over
in nineteen seconds and we were down at Johnson City. I took it right,
just a terrible constriction in chest and a feeling as if giant were
squeezing heart, then was over and I was gasping back to normal and glad
to be proper weight. But did almost kill poor old Prof.
Mike told me later that pilot refused to surrender control; Mike
would have brought ship down in a low-gee, no-breakum-egg, knowing Prof
was aboard. But perhaps that Cyborg knew what he was doing; a low-gee
landing wastes mass and Lotus-Lark grounded almost dry.
None of which we cared about, as looked as if that Garrison landing
had wasted Prof. Stu saw it while I was still gasping, then we were both
at him--heart stimulant, manual respiration, massage. At last he
fluttered eyelids, looked at us, smiled. "Home," he whispered.
We made him rest twenty minutes before we let him suit up to leave
ship; had been as near dead as can be and not hear angels. Skipper was
filling tanks, anxious to get rid of us and take on passengers--that
Dutchman never spoke to us whole trip; think he regretted letting money
talk him into a trip that could ruin or kill him.
By then Wyoh was inside ship, p-suited to come meet us. Don't think
Stu had ever seen her in a p-suit and certain he had never seen her as a
blonde; did not recognize. I was hugging her in spite of p-suit; he was
standing by, waiting to be introduced. Then strange "man" in p-suit
hugged him--he was surprised.
Heard Wyoh's muffled voice: "Oh heavens! Mannie, my helmet."
I unclamped it, lifted off. She shook curls and grinned. "Stu,
aren't you glad to see me? Don't you know me?"
A grin spread over his face, slowly as dawn across maria.
"Zdra'stvooeet'ye, Gospazha! I am most happy to see you."
"'Gospazha' indeed! I'm Wyoh to you, dear, always. Didn't Mannie
tell you I'd gone back to blonde?"
"Yes, he did. But knowing it and seeing are not the same."
"You'll get used to it." She stopped to bend over Prof, kiss him,
giggle at him, then straightened up and gave me a no-helmet welcome-home
that left us both with tears despite pesky suit. Then turned again to
Stu, started to kiss him.
He held back a little. She stopped. "Stu, am I going to have to put
on brown makeup to welcome you?" Stu glanced at me, then kissed her. Wyoh
put in as much time and thought as she had to welcoming me.
Was later I figured out his odd behavior. Stu, despite commitment,
was still not a Loonie--and in meantime Wyoh had married. What's that got

to do with it? Well, Earthside it makes a difference, and Stu did not
know deep down in bones that a Loonie lady is own mistress. Poor chum
thought I might take offense!
We got Prof into suit, ourselves same, and left, me with cannon
under arm. Once underground and locked through, we unsuited--and I was
flattered to see that Wyoh was wearing crushed under p-suit that red
dress I bought her ages ago. She brushed it and skirt flared out.
Immigration room was empty save for about forty men lined up along
wall like new transportees; were wearing p-suits and carrying helmets-Terrans going home, stranded tourists and some scientists. Their p-suits
would not go, would be unloaded before lift. I looked at them and thought
about Cyborg pilot. When Lark had been stripped, all but three couches
had been removed; these people were going to take acceleration lying on
floorplates--if skipper was not careful he was going to have mashed
Terrans au blut.
Mentioned to Stu. "Forget it," he said. "Captain Leures has foam
pads aboard. He won't let them be hurt; they're his life insurance."

21
My family, all thirty-odd from Grandpaw to babies, was waiting beyond
next lock on level he! ow and we got cried on and slobbered on and hugged
and this time Stu did not hold back. Little Hazel made ceremony of
kissing us; she had Liberty Caps, set one on each, then kissed us--and at
that signal whole family put on Liberty Caps, and I got sudden tears.
Perhaps is what patriotism feels like, choked up and so happy it hurts.
Or maybe was just being with my beloveds again.
"Where's Slim?" I asked Hazel. "Wasn't he invited?"
"Couldn't come. He's junior marshal of your reception."
"Reception? This is all we want."
"You'll see."
Did. Good thing family came out to meet us; that and ride to L-City
(filled a capsule) were all I saw of them for some time. Tube Station
West was a howling mob, all in Liberty Caps. We three were carried on
shoulders all way to Old Dome, surrounded by a stilyagi bodyguard, elbows
locked to force through cheering, singing crowds. Boys were wearing red
caps and white shirts and their girls wore white jumpers and red shorts
color of caps.
At station and again when they put us down in Old Dome I got kissed
by fems I have never seen before or since. Remember hoping that measures
we had taken in lieu of quarantine were effective--or half of L-City
would be down with colds or worse. (Apparently we were clean; was no
epidemic. But I remember time--was quite small--when measles got loose
and thousands died.)
Worried about Prof, too; reception was too rough for a man good as
dead an hour earlier. But he not only enjoyed it, he made a wonderful
speech in Old Dome--one short on logic, loaded with ringing phrases.
"Love" was in it, and "home" and "Luna" and "comrades and neighbors" and
even "shoulder to shoulder" and all sounded good.

They had erected a platform under big news video on south face.
Adam Selene greeted us from video screen and now Prof's face and voice
were projected from it, much magnified, over his head--did not have to
shout. But did have to pause after every sentence; crowd roars drowned
out even bull voice from screen--and no doubt pauses helped, as rest. But
Prof no longer seemed old, tired, ill; being back inside The Rock seemed
to be tonic he needed. And me, too! Was wonderful to be right weight,
feel strong, breathe pure, replenished air of own city.
No mean city! Impossible to get all of L-City inside Old Dome--but
looked as if they tried. I estimated an area ten meters square, tried to
count heads, got over two hundred not half through and gave up. Lunatic
placed crowd at thirty thousand, seems impossible.
Prof's words reached more nearly three million; video carried scene
to those who could not crowd into Old Dome, cable and relay flashed it
across lonely maria to all warrens. He grabbed chance to tell of slave
future Authority planned for them. Waved that "white paper."
"Here it is!" he cried. "Your fetters! Your leg irons! Will you
wear them?"
"NO!"
"They say you must. They say they will H-bomb... then survivors
will surrender and put on these chains. Will you?"
"NO! NEVER!"
"Never," agreed Prof. "They threaten to send troops... more and
more troops to rape and murder. We shall fight them."
"DA!"
"We shall fight them on the surface, we shall fight them in the
tubes, we shall fight them in the corridors! If die we must, we shall die
free!"
"Yes! Ja-da! Tell 'em, tell 'em!"
"And if we die, let history write: This was Luna's finest hour!
Give us liberty... or give us death!"
Some of that sounded familiar. But his words came out fresh and
new; I joined in roars. Look... I knew we couldn't whip Terra--I'm tech
by trade and know that an H-missile doesn't care how brave you are. But
was ready, too. If they wanted a fight, let's have it!
Prof let them roar, then led them in "Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
Simon's version. Adam appeared on screen again, took over leading it and
sang with them, and we tried to slip away, off back of platform, with
help of stilyagi led by Slim. But women didn't want to let us go and lads
aren't at their best in trying to stop ladies; they broke through. Was
twenty-two hundred before we four, Wyoh, Prof, Stu, self, were locked in
room L of Raffles, where Adam-Mike joined us by video. I was starved by
then, all were, so I ordered dinner and Prof insisted that we eat before
reviewing plans.
Then we got down to business.
Adam started by asking me to read aloud white paper, for his
benefit and for Comrade Wyoming--"But first, Comrade Manuel, if you have
the recordings you made Earthside, could you transmit them by phone at
high speed to my office? I'll have them transcribed for study--all I have
so far are the coded summaries Comrade Stuart sent up."
I did so, knowing Mike would study them at once, phrasing was part
of "Adam Selene" myth--and decided to talk to Prof about letting Stu in
on facts. If Stu was to be in executive cell, pretending was too clumsy.

Feeding recordings into Mike at overspeed took five minutes,
reading aloud another thirty. That done, Adam said, "Professor, the
reception was more successful than I had counted on, due to your speech.
I think we should push the embargo through Congress at once. I can send
out a call tonight for a session at noon tomorrow. Comments?"
I said, "Look, those yammerheads will kick it around for weeks. If
you must put it up to them--can't see why--do as you did with
Declaration. Start late, jam it through after midnight using own people."
Adam said, "Sorry, Manuel. I'm getting caught up on events
Earthside and you have catching up to do here. It's no longer the same
group. Comrade Wyoming?"
"Mannie dear, it's an elected Congress now. They must pass it.
Congress is what government we have."
I said slowly, "You held election and turned things over to them?
Everything? Then what are we doing?" Looked at Prof, expecting explosion.
My objections would not be on his grounds--but couldn't see any use in
swapping one talk-talk for another. At least first group had been so
loose we could pack it--this new group would be glued to seats.
Prof was undisturbed. Fitted fingertips together and looked
relaxed. "Manuel, I don't think the situation is as bad as you seem to
feel that it is. In each age it is necessary to adapt to the popular
mythology. At one time kings were anointed by Deity, so the problem was
to see to it that Deity anointed the tight candidate. In this age the
myth is 'the will of the people'... but the problem changes only
superficially. Comrade Adam and I have had long discussions about how to
determine the will of the people. I venture to suggest that this solution
is one we can work with."
"Well... okay. But why weren't we told? Stu, did you know?"
"No, Mannie. There was no reason to tell me." He shrugged. "I'm a
monarchist, I wouldn't have been interested. But I go along with Prof
that in this day and age elections are a necessary ritual."
Prof said, "Manuel, it wasn't necessary to tell us till we got
back; you and I had other work to do. Comrade Adam and dear Comrade
Wyoming handled it in our absence... so let's find out what they did
before we judge what they've done."
"Sorry. Well, Wyoh?"
"Mannie, we didn't leave everything to chance. Adam and I decided
that a Congress of three hundred would be about right. Then we spent
hours going over the Party lists--plus prominent people not in the Party.
At last we had a list of candidates--a list that included some from the
Ad-Hoc Congress; not all were yammerheads, we included as many as we
could. Then Adam phoned each one and asked him--or her--if he would
serve... binding him to secrecy in the meantime. Some we had to replace.
"When we were ready, Adam spoke on video, announced that it was
time to carry out the Party's pledge of free elections, set a date, said
that everybody over sixteen could vote, and that all anyone had to do to
be a candidate was to get a hundred chops on a nominating petition and
post it in Old Dome, or the public notice place for his warren. Oh, yes,
thirty temporary election districts, ten Congressmen from each district-that let all but the smallest warrens be at least one district."
"So you had it lined up and Party ticket went through?"
"Oh, no, dear! There wasn't any Party ticket--officially. But we
were ready with our candidates... and I must say my stilyagi did a smart
job getting chops on nominations; our optings were posted the first day.

Many other people posted; there were over two thousand candidates. But
there was only ten days from announcement to election, and we knew what
we wanted whereas the opposition was split up. It wasn't necessary for
Adam to come out publicly and endorse candidates. It worked out--you won
by seven thousand votes, dear, while your nearest rival got less than a
thousand."
"I won?"
"You won, I won, Professor won, Comrade Clayton won, and just about
everybody we thought should be in the Congress. It wasn't hard. Although
Adam never endorsed anayone, I didn't hesitate to let our comrades know
who was favored. Simon poked his finger in, too. And we do have good
connections with newspapers. I wish you had been here election night,
watching the results. Exciting!"
"How did you go about nose counting? Never known how election
works. Write names on a piece of paper?"
"Oh, no, we used a better system... because, after all, some of our
best people can't write. We used banks for voting places, with bank
clerks identifying customers and customers identifying members of their
families and neighbors who don't have bank accounts--and people voted
orally and the clerks punched the votes into the banks' computers with
the voter watching, and results were all tallied at once in Luna City
clearinghouse. We voted everybody in less than three hours and results
were printed out just minutes after voting stopped."
Suddenly a light came on in my skull and I decided to question Wyoh
privately. No, not Wyoh--Mike. Get past his "Adam Selene" dignity and
hammer truth out of his neuristors. Recalled a cheque ten million dollars
too large and wondered how many had voted for me? Seven thousand? Seven
hundred? Or just my family and friends?
But no longer worried about new Congress. Prof had not slipped them
a cold deck but one that was frozen solid--then ducked Earthside while
crime was committed. No use asking Wyoh; she didn't even need to know
what Mike had done... and could do her part better if did not suspect.
Nor would anybody suspect. If was one thing all people took for
granted, was conviction that if you feed honest figures into a computer,
honest figures come out. Never doubted it myself till met a computer with
sense of humor.
Changed mind about suggesting that Stu be let in on Mike's selfawareness. Three was two too many. Or perhaps three. "Mi--" I started to
say, and changed to: "My word! Sounds efficient. How big did we win?"
Adam answered without expression. "Eighty-six percent of our
candidates were successful--approximately what I had expected."
("Approximately," my false left arm! Exactly what expected, Mike
old ironmongery!) "Withdraw objection to a noon session--I'll be there."
"It seems to me," said Stu, "assuming that the embargo starts at
once, we will need something to maintain the enthusiasm we witnessed
tonight. Or there will be a long quiet period of increasing economic
depression--from the embargo, I mean--and growing disillusionment. Adam,
you first impressed me through your ability to make shrewd guesses as to
future events. Do my misgivings make sense?"
"They do."
"Well?"
Adam looked at us in turn, and was almost impossible to believe
that this was a false image and Mike was simply placing us through

binaural receptors. "Comrades... it must be turned into open war as
quickly as possible."
Nobody said anything. One thing to talk about war, another to face
up to it. At last I sighed and said, "When do we start throwing rocks?"
"We do not start," Adam answered. "They must throw the first one.
How do we antagonize them into doing so? I will reserve my thoughts to
the last. Comrade Manuel?"
"Uh... don't look at me. Way I feel, would start with a nice big
rock smack on Agra--a bloke there who is a waste of space. But is not
what you are after."
"No, it is not," Adam answered seriously. "You would not only anger
the entire Hindu nation, a people intensely opposed to destruction of
life, but you would also anger and shock people throughout Earth by
destroying the Taj Mahal."
"Including me," said Prof. "Don't talk dirty, Manuel."
"Look," I said, "didn't say to do it. Anyhow, could miss Taj."
"Manuel," said Prof, "as Adam pointed out, our strategy must be to
antagonize them into striking the first blow, the classic 'Pearl Harbor'
maneuver of game theory, a great advantage in Weltpolitick. The question
is how? Adam, I suggest that what is needed is to plant the idea that we
are weak and divided and that all it takes is a show of force to bring us
back into line. Stu? Your people Earthside should be useful. Suppose the
Congress repudiated myself and Manuel? The effect?"
"Oh, no!" said Wyoh.
"Oh, yes, dear Wyoh. Not necessary to do it but simply to put it
over news channels to Earth. Perhaps still better to put it out over a
clandestine beam attributed to the Terran scientists still with us while
our official channels display the classic stigmata of tight censorship.
Adam?"
"I'm noting it as a tactic which probably will be included in the
strategy. But it will not be sufficient alone. We must be bombed."
"Adam," said Wyoh, "why do you say so? Even if Luna City can stand
up under their biggest bombs--something I hope never to find out--we know
that Luna can't win an all-out war. You've said so, many times. Isn't
there some way to work it so that they will just plain leave us alone?"
Adam pulled at right cheek--and I thought: Mike, if you don't knock
off play-acting, you'll have me believing in you myself! Was annoyed at
him and looked forward to a talk--one in which I would not have to defer
to "Chairman Selene."
"Comrade Wyoming," he said soberly, "it's a matter of game theory
in a complex non-zero-sum game. We have certain resources or 'pieces in
the game' and many possible moves. Our opponents have much larger
resources and a far larger spectrum of responses. Our problem is to
manipulate the game so that our strength is utilized toward an optimax
solution while inducing them to waste their superior strength and to
refrain from using it at maximum. Timing is of the essence and a gambit
is necessary to start a chain of events favorable to our strategy. I
realize this is not clear. I could put the factors through a computer and
show you. Or you can accept the conclusion. Or you can use your own
judgment."
He was reminding Wyoh (under Stu's nose) that he was not Adam
Selene but Mike, our dinkum thinkum who could handle so complex a problem
because he was a computer and smartest one anywhere.

Wyoh backtracked. "No, no," she said, "I wouldn't understand the
maths. Okay, it has to be done. How do we do it?"
Was four hundred before we had a plan that suited Prof and Stu as
well as Adam--or took that long for Mike to sell his plan while appearing
to pull ideas out of rest of us. Or was it Prof's plan with Adam Selene
as salesman?
In any case we had a plan and calendar, one that grew out of master
strategy of Tuesday 14 May 2075 and varied from it only to match events
as they actually had occurred. In essence it called for us to behave as
nastily as possible while strengthening impression that we would be
awfully easy to spank.
Was at Community Hall at noon, after too little sleep, and found I
could have slept two hours longer; Congressmen from Hong Kong could not
make it that early despite tube all way. Wyoh did not bang gavel until
fourteen-thirty.
Yes, my bride wife was chairman pro tem in a body not yet
organized. Parliamentary rulings seemed to come naturally to her, and she
was not a bad choice; a mob of Loonies behaves better when a lady bangs
gavel.
Not going to detail what new Congress did and said that session and
later; minutes are available. I showed up only when necessary and never
bothered to learn talk-talk rules--seemed to be equal parts common
politeness and ways in which chairman could invoke magic to do it his
(her) way.
No sooner had Wyoh banged them to order but a cobber jumped up and
said, "Gospazha Chairmah, move we suspend rules and hear from Comrade
Professor de la Paz!"--which brought a whoop of approval.
Wyoh banged again. "Motion is out of order and Member from Lower
Churchill will be seated. This house recessed without adjourning and
Chairman of Committee on Permanent Organization, Resolutions, and
Government Structure still has the floor."
Turned out to be Wolfgang Korsakov, Member from Tycho Under (and a
member of Prof's cell and our number-one finagler of LuNoHoCo) and he not
only had floor, he had it all day, yielding time as he saw fit (i. e.,
picking out whom he wanted to speak rather than letting just anyone
talk). But nobody was too irked; this mob seemed satisfied with
leadership. Were noisy but not unruly.
By dinnertime Luna had a government to replace co-opted provisional
government--i. e., dummy government we had opted ourselves, which sent
Prof and me to Earth. Congress confirmed all acts of provisional
government, thus putting face on what we had done, thanked outgoing
government for services and instructed Wolfgang's committee to continue
work on permanent government structure.
Prof was elected President of Congress and ex-officio Prime
Minister of interim government until we acquired a constitution. He
protested age and health... then said would serve if could have certain
things to help him; too old and too exhausted from trip Earthside to have
responsibility of presiding--except on occasions of state--so he wanted
Congress to elect a Speaker and Speaker Pro Tem... and besides that, he
felt that Congress should augment its numbers by not more than ten
percent by itself electing members-at-large so that Prime Minister,
whoever he might be, could opt cabinet members or ministers of state who
might not now be members of Congress-especially ministers-withoutportfolio to take load off his shoulders.

They balked. Most were proud of being "Congressmen" and already
jealous of status. But Prof just sat looking tired, and waited--and
somebody pointed out that it still left control in hands of Congress. So
they gave him what he asked for.
Then somebody squeezed in a speech by making it a question to
Chair. Everybody knew (he said) that Adam Selene had refrained from
standing for Congress on grounds that Chairman of Emergency Committee
should not take advantage of position to elbow way into new government...
but could Honorable Chairlady tell member whether was any reason not
elect Adam Selene a member-at-large? As gesture of appreciation for great
services? To let all Luna--yes, and all those earthworms, especially exLunar ex-Authority--know that we not repudiating Adam Selene, on contrary
he was our beloved elder statesman and was not President simply because
he chose not to be!
More whoops that went on and on. You can find in minutes who made
that speech but one gets you ten Prof wrote it and Wyoh planted it.
Here is how it wound up over course of days: Prime Minister and
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: Professor Bernardo de la Paz.
Speaker, Finn Nielsen; Speaker Pro Tem, Wyoming Davis.
Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Minister of
Defense, General O'Kelly Davis; Minister of Information, Terence Sheehan
(Sheenie turned Pravda over to managing editor to work with Adam and
Stu); Special Minister-without-Portfolio in Ministry of Information,
Stuart Rene LaJoie, Congressman-at-Large; Secretary of State for
Economics and Finance (and Custodian of Enemy Property), Wolfgang
Korsakov; Minister of Interior Affairs and Safety, Comrade "Clayton"
Watenabe; Minter-without-Portfolio and Special Advisor to Prime Minister,
Adam Selene--plus a dozen ministers and ministers-without-portfolio from
warrens other than Luna City.
See where that left things? Brush away fancy titles and B cell was
still running things as advised by Mike, backed by a Congress in which we
could not lose a test vote--but did lose others we did not want to win,
or did not care about.
But at time could not see sense in all that talk-talk.
During evening session Prof reported on trip and then yielded to
me--Committee Chairman Korsakov consenting--so that I could report what
"five-year plan" meant and how Authority had tried to bribe me. I'll
never make a speaker but had time during dinner break to swot speech Mike
had written. He had slanted it so nastily that I got angry all over again
and was angry when I spoke and managed to make it catching. Congress was
ready to riot by time I sat down.
Prof stepped forward, thin and pale, and said quietly, "Comrade
Members, what shall we do? I suggest, Chairman Korsakov consenting, that
we discuss informally how to treat this latest insolence to our nation."
One member from Novylen wanted to declare war and they would have
done so right then if Prof had not pointed out that they were still
hearing committee reports.
More talk, all bitter. At last Comrade Member Chang Jones spoke:
"Fellow Congressmen--sorry, Gospodin Chairman Korsakov--I'm a rice and
wheat farmer. Mean I used to be, because back in May I got a bank loan
and sons and I are converting to variety farming. We're broke--had to
borrow tube fare to get here--but family is eating and someday we might
pull square with bank. At least I'm no longer raising grain.

"But others are. Catapult has never reduced headway by one barge
whole time we've been free. We're still shipping, hoping their cheques
will be worth something someday.
"But now we know! They've told us what they mean to do with us--to
us! I say only way to make those scoundrels know we mean business is stop
shipments right now! Not another tonne, not a kilo... until they come
here and dicker honestly for honest price!"
Around midnight they passed Embargo, then adjourned subject to
call... standing committees to continue.
Wyoh and I went home and I got reacquainted with my family. Was
nothing to do; Mike-Adam and Stu had been working on how to hit them with
it Earthside and Mike had shut catapult down ("technical difficulties
with ballistic computer") twenty-four hours earlier. Last barge in
trajectory would be taken by Poona Ground Control in slightly over one
day and Earth would be told, nastily, that was last they would ever get.

22
Shock to farmers was eased by continuing to buy grain at catapult--but
cheques now carried printed warning that Luna Free State did not stand
behind them, did not warrant that Lunar Authority would ever redeem them
even in Scrip, etc., etc. Some farmers left grain anyhow, some did not,
all screamed. But was nothing they could do; catapult was shut down,
loading belts not moving.
Depression was not immediately felt in rest of economy. Defense
regiments had depleted ranks of ice miners so much that selling ice on
free market was profitable; LuNoHoCo steel subsidiary was hiring every
able-bodied man it could find, and Wolfgang Korsakov was ready with paper
money, "National Dollars," printed to resemble Hong Kong dollar and in
theory pegged to it. Luna had plenty of food, plenty of work, plenty of
money; people were not hurting, "beer, betting, women, and work" went on
as usual.
"Nationals," as they were called, were inflation money, war money,
fiat money, and were discounted a fraction of a percent on day of first
issue, concealed as "exchange service charge." They were spendable money
and never did drop to zero but were inflationary and exchange reflected
it increasingly; new government was spending money it did not have.
But that was later--Challenge to Earth, to Authority and Federated
Nations, was made intentionally nasty. F. N. vessels were ordered to stay
clear of Luna by ten diameters and not orbit at any distance under pain
of being destroyed without warning. (No mention of how, since we could
not.) Vessels of private registry would be permitted to land if a)
permission was requested ahead of time with ballistic plan, b) a vessel
thus cleared placed itself under Luna Ground Control (Mike') at a
distance of one hundred thousand kilometers while following approved
trajectory, and c) was unarmed save for three hand guns permitted three
officers. Last was to be confirmed by inspection on landing before
anybody was allowed to leave ship and before ship was serviced with fuel
and/or reaction mass; violation would mean confiscation of ship. No

person allowed to land at Luna other than ship's crew in connection with
loading, unloading, or servicing save citizens of Terran countries who
had recognized Free Luna. (Only Chad--and Chad had no ships. Prof
expected some private vessels to be re-registered under Chad merchant
flag.)
Manifesto noted that Terran scientists still in Luna could return
home in any vessel which conformed to our requirements. It invited all
freedom-loving Terran nations to denounce wrongs done us and which the
Authority planned against us, recognize us, and enjoy free trade and full
intercourse--and pointed out that there were no tariffs or any artificial
restrictions against trade in Luna, and was policy of Luna government to
keep it that way. We invited immigration, unlimited, and pointed out that
we had a labor shortage and any immigrant could be self-supporting at
once.
We also boasted of food--adult consumption over four thousand
calories per day, high in protein, low in cost, no rationing. (Stu had
Adam-Mike stick in price of 100-proof vodka--fifty cents HKL per liter,
less in quantity, no taxes. Since this was less than one-tenth retail
price of 80-proof vodka in North America, Stu knew it would hit home.
Adam, "by nature" a teetotaler, hadn't thought of it--one of Mike's few
oversights.)
Lunar Authority was invited to gather at one spot well away from
other people, say in unirrigated part of Sahara, and receive one last
barge of grain free--straight down at terminal velocity. This was
followed by a snotty lecture which implied that we were prepared to do
same to anyone who threatened our peace, there being a number of loaded
barges at catapult head, ready for such unceremonious delivery.
Then we waited.
But we waited busily. Were indeed a few loaded barges; these we
unloaded and reloaded with rock, with changes made in guidance
transponders so that Poona Control could not affect them. Their retros
were removed, leaving only lateral thrustors, and spare retros were taken
to new catapult, to be modified for lateral guidance. Greatest effort
went into moving steel to new catapult and shaping it into jackets for
solid rock cylinders--steel was bottleneck.
Two days after our manifesto a "clandestine" radio started beaming
to Terra. Was weak and tended to fade and was supposed to be concealed,
presumably in a crater, and could be worked only certain hours until
brave Terran scientists managed to rig automatic repeat. Was near
frequency of Voice of Free Luna, which tended to drown it out with brassy
boasts.
(Terrans remaining in Luna had no chance to make signals. Those who
had chosen to stick with research were chaperoned by stilyagi every
instant and locked into barracks to sleep.)
But "clandestine" station managed to get "truth" to Terra. Prof had
been tried for deviationism and was under house arrest. I had been
executed for treason. Hong Kong Luna had pulled out, declared self
separately independent... might be open to reason. Rioting in Novylen.
All food growing had been collectivized and black-market eggs were
selling for three dollars apiece in Lana City. Battalions of female
troops were being enlisted, each sworn to kill at least one Terran, and
were drilling with fake guns in corridors of Luna City.
Last was an almost-true. Many ladies wanted to do something
militant and had formed a Home Defense Guard, "Ladies from Hades." But

their drills were of a practical nature--and Hazel was sulking because
Mum had not allowed her to join. Then she got over sulks and started
"Stilyagi Debs," a very junior home guard which drilled after school
hours, did not use weapons, concentrated on backing up stilyagi air &
pressure corps, and practiced first aid--and own no-weapons fighting,
which--possibly--Mum never learned.
I don't know how much to tell. Can't tell all, but stuff in history
books is so wrong!
I was no better a "defense minister" than "congressman." Not
apologizing, had no training for either. Revolution is an amateur thing
for almost everybody; Prof was only one who seemed to know what he was
doing, and, at that, was new to him, too--he had never taken part in a
successful revolution or ever been part of a government, much less head.
As Minister of Defense I could not see many ways to defend except
for steps already taken; that is, stilyagi air squads in warrens and
laser gunners around ballistic radars. If F. N. decided to bomb, didn't
see any way to stop them; wasn't an interception missile in all Luna and
that's not a gadget you whomp up from bits and pieces. My word, we
couldn't even make fusion weapons with which such a rocket is tipped.
But I went through motions. Asked same Chinee engineers who had
built laser guns to take a crack at problem of intercepting bombs or
missiles--one same problem save that a missile comes at you faster.
Then turned attention to other things. Simply hoped that F. N.
would never bomb warrens. Some warrens, L-City in particular, were so
deep down that they could probably stand direct hits. One cubic, lowest
level of Complex where central part of Mike lived, had been designed to
withstand bombing. On other hand Tycho Under was a big natural bubble
cave like Old Dome and roof was only meters thick; sealer on under side
is kept warm with hot water pipes to make sure new cracks sealed--would
not take much of a bomb to crack Tycho Under.
But is no limit to how big a fusion bomb can be; F. N. could build
one big enough to smash L-City----or theoretically even a Doomsday job
that would split Luna like a melon and finish job some asteroid started
at Tycho. If they did, couldn't see any way to stop them, so didn't
worry.
Instead put time on problems I could manage, helping at new
catapult, trying to work up better aiming arrangements for laser drills
around radars (and trying to get drillmen to stick; half of them quit
once price of ice went up), trying to arrange decentralized standby
engineering controls for all warrens. Mike did designing on this, we
grabbed every general-purpose computer we could find (paying in
"nationals" with ink barely dry), and I turned job over to McIntyre,
former chief engineer for Authority; was a job within his talents and I
couldn't do all rewiring and so forth, even if had tried.
Held out biggest computer, one that did accounting for Bank of Hong
Kong in Luna and also was clearinghouse there. Looked over its
instruction manuals and decided was a smart computer for one that could
not talk, so asked Mike if he could teach it ballistics? We made
temporary link-ups to let two machines get acquainted and Mike reported
it could learn simple job we wanted it for--standby for new catapult-although Mike would not care to ride in ship controlled by it; was too
matter-of-fact and uncritical. Stupid, really.

Well, didn't want it to whistle tunes or crack jokes; just wanted
it to shove loads out a catapult at right millisecond and at correct
velocity, then watch load approach Terra and give a nudge.
HK Bank was not anxious to sell. But we had patriots on their
board, we promised to return it when emergency was over, and moved it to
new site--by rolligon, too big for tubes, and took all one dark semilunar. Had to jerry-rig a big airlock to get it out of Kong warren. I
hooked it to Mike again and he undertook to teach art of ballistics
against possibility that his linkage to new site might be cut in an
attack.
(You know what bank used to replace computer? Two hundred clerks
working abacuses. Abacusi? You know, slipsticks with beads, oldest
digital computer, so far back in prehistory that nobody knows who
invented. Russki and Chinee and Nips have always used them, and small
shops today.)
Trying to improve laser drills into space-defense weapons was
easier but less straightforward. We had to leave them mounted on original
cradles; was neither time, steel, nor metalsmiths to start fresh. So we
concentrated on better aiming arrangements. Call went out for telescopes.
Scarce--what con fetches along a spyglass when transported? What market
later to create supply? Surveying instruments and helmet binoculars were
all we turned up, plus optical instruments confiscated in Terran labs.
But we managed to equip drills with low-power big-field sights to coachon with and high-power scopes for fine sighting, plus train and elevation
circles and phones so that Mike could tell them where to point. Four
drills we equipped with self-synchronous repeater drives so that Mike
could control them himself--liberated these selsyns at Richardson;
astronomers used them for Bausch cameras and Schmidts in sky mapping.
But big problem was men. Wasn't money, we kept upping wages. No, a
drillman likes to work or wouldn't be in that trade. Standing by in a
ready room day after day, waiting for alert that always turns out to be
just another practice--drove 'em crackers. They quit. One day in
September I pulled an alert and got only seven drills manned.
Talked it over with Wyoh and Sidris that night. Next day Wyoh
wanted to know if Prof and I would okay bolshoi expense money? They
formed something Wyoh named "Lysistrata Corps." Never inquired into
duties or cost, because next time I inspected a ready room found three
girls and no shortage of drillmen. Girls were in uniform of Second
Defense Gunners just as men were (drillmen hadn't bothered much with
authorized uniform up to then) and one girl was wearing sargeant's
stripes with gun captain's badge.
I made that inspection very short. Most girls don't have muscle to
be a drillman and I doubted if this girl could wrestle a drill well
enough to justify that badge. But regular gun captain was on job, was no
harm in girls learning to handle lasers, morale was obviously high; I
gave matter no more worry.
Prof underrated his new Congress. Am sure he never wanted anything
but a body which would rubberchop what we were doing and thereby do make
it "voice of people." But fact that new Congressmen were not yammerheads
resulted in them doing more than Prof intended. Especially Committee on
Permanent Organization, Resolutions, and Government Structure.
Got out of hand because we were all trying to do too much.
Permanent heads of Congress were Prof, Finn Nielsen. and Wyoh. Prof
showed up only when he wanted to speak to them--seldom. He spent time

with Mike on plans and analysis (odds shortened to one in five during
September '76), time with Stu and Sheenie Sheehan on propaganda,
controlling official news to Earthside, very different "news" that went
via "clandestine" radio, and reslanting news that came up from Earthside.
Besides that he had finger in everything; I reported whim once a day, and
all ministries both real and dummy did same.
I kept Finn Nielsen busy; he was my "Commander of Armed Forces." He
had his laser gun infantry to supervise--six men with captured weapons on
day we nabbed warden, now eight hundred scattered all through Luna and
armed with Kongville monkey copies. Besides that, Wyoh's organizations,
Stilyagi Air Corps, Stilyagi Debs, Ladies from Hades, Irregulars (kept
for morale and renamed Peter Pan's Pirates), and Lysistrata Corps--all
these halfway-military groups reported through Wyoh to Finn. I shoved it
onto him; I had other problems, such as trying to be a computer mechanic
as well as a "statesman" when jobs such as installing that computer at
new catapult site had to be done.
Besides which, I am not an executive and Finn had talent for it. I
shoved First and Second Defense Gunners under him, too. But first I
decided that these two skeleton regiments were a "brigade" and made Judge
Brody a "brigadier." Brody knew as much about military matters as I did-zero--but was widely known, highly respected, had unlimited hard sense-and had been drillman before he lost leg. Finn was not drillman, so
couldn't be placed directly over them; They wouldn't have listened. I
thought about using my co-husband Greg. But Greg was needed at Mare
Undarum catapult, was only mechanic who had followed every phase of
construction.
Wyoh helped Prof, helped Stu, had her own organizations, I made
trips out to Mare Undarum--and had little time to preside over Congress;
task fell on senior committee chairman, Wolf Korsakov... who was busier
than any of us; LuNoHoCo was running everything Authority used to run and
many new things as well.
Wolf had a good committee; Prof should have kept closer eye on it.
Wolf had caused his boss, Moshai Baum, to be elected vice-chairman and
had in all seriousness outlined for his committee problem of determining
what permanent government should be. Then Wolf had turned back on it.
Those busy laddies split up and did it--studied forms of government
in Carnegie Library, held subcommittee meetings, three or four people at
a time (few enough to worry Prof had he known)--and when Congress met
early in September to ratify some appointments and elect more
congressmen-at-large, instead of adjourning, Comrade Baum had gavel and
they recessed--and met again and turned selves into committee-of-thewhole and passed a resolution and next thing we knew entire Congress was
a Constitutional Convention divided into working groups headed by those
subcommittees.
I think Prof was shocked. But he couldn't undo it, had all been
proper under rules he himself had written. But he rolled with punch, went
to Novylen (where Congress now met--more central) and spoke to them with
usual good nature and simply cast doubts on what they were doing rather
than telling them flatly they were wrong.
After gracefully thanking them he started picking early drafts to
pieces: "Comrade Members, like fire and fusion, government is a dangerous
servant and a terrible master. You now have freedom--if you can keep it.
But do remember that you can lose this freedom more quickly to yourselves
than to any other tyrant. Move slowly, be hesitant, puzzle out the

consequences of every word. I would not be unhappy if this convention sat
for ten years before reporting--but I would be frightened if you took
less than a year.
"Distrust the obvious, suspect the traditional... for in the past
mankind has not done well when saddling itself with governments. For
example, I note in one draft report a proposal for setting up a
commission to divide Luna into congressional districts and to reapportion
them from time to time according to population.
"This is the traditional way; therefore it should be suspect,
considered guilty until proved innocent. Perhaps you feel that this is
the only way. May I suggest others? Surely where a man lives is the least
important thing about him. Constituencies might be formed by dividing
people by occupation... or by age... or even alphabetically. Or they
might not be divided, every member elected at large---and do not object
that this would make it impossible for any man not widely known
throughout Luna to be elected; that might be the best possible thing for
Luna.
"You might even consider installing the candidates who receive the
least number of votes; unpopular men may be just the sort to save you
from a new tyranny. Don't reject the idea merely because it seems
preposterous--think about it! In past history popularly elected
governments have been no better and sometimes far worse than overt
tyrannies.
"But if representative government turns out to be your intention
there still may be ways to achieve it better than the territorial
district. For example you each represent about ten thousand human beings,
perhaps seven thousand of voting age--and some of you were elected by
slim majorities. Suppose instead of election a man were qualified for
office by petition signed by four thousand citizens. He would then
represent those four thousand affirmatively, with no disgruntled
minority, for what would have been a minority in a territorial
constituency would all be free to start other petitions or join in them.
All would then be represented by men of their choice. Or a man with eight
thousand supporters might have two votes in this body. Difficulties,
objections, practical points to be worked out--many of them! But you
could work them out... and thereby avoid the chronic sickness of
representative government, the disgruntled minority which feels-correctly!--that it has been disenfranchised.
"But, whatever you do, do not let the past be a straitjacket!
"I note one proposal to make this Congress a two-house body.
Excellent--the more impediments to legislation the better. But, instead
of following tradition, I suggest one house legislators, another whose
single duty is to repeal laws. Let legislators pass laws only with a twothirds majority... while the repealers are able to cancel any law through
a mere one-third minority. Preposterous? Think about it. If a bill is so
poor that it cannot command two-thirds of your consents, is it not likely
that it would make a poor law? And if a law is disliked by as many as
one-third is it not likely that you would be better off without it?
"But in writing your constitution let me invite attention the
wonderful virtues of the negative! Accentuate the negative! Let your
document be studded with things the government is forever forbidden to
do. No conscript armies... no interference however slight with freedom of
press, or speech, or travel, or assembly, or of religion, or of
instruction, or communication, or occupation... no involuntary taxation.

Comrades, if you were to spend five years in a study of history while
thinking of more and more things that your governinen should promise
never to do and then let your constitution be nothing but those
negatives, I would not fear the outcome.
"What I fear most are affirmative actions of sober and wellintentioned men, granting to government powers to do something that
appears to need doing. Please remember always that the Lunar Authority
was created for the noblest of purposes by just such sober and wellintentioned men, all popularly elected. And with that thought I leave you
to your labors. Thank you."
"Gospodin President! Question of information! You said 'no
involuntary taxation'--Then how do you expect us to pay for things?
Tanstaafl!"
"Goodness me, sir, that's your problem. I can think several ways.
Voluntary contributions just as churches support themselves...
government-sponsored lotteries to which no one need subscribe... or
perhaps you Congressmen should dig down into your own pouches and pay for
whatever is needed; that would be one way to keep government down in size
to its indispensable functions whatever they may be. If indeed there are
any. I would be satisfied to have the Golden Rule be the only law; I see
no need for any other, nor for any method of enforcing it. But if you
really believe that your neighbors must have laws for their own good, why
shouldn't you pay for it? Comrades, I beg you--do not resort to
compulsory taxation. There is so worse tyranny than to force a man to pay
for what he does not want merely because you think it would be good for
him."
Prof bowed and left, Stu and I followed him. Once in an otherwise
empty capsule I tackled him. "Prof, I liked much that you said... but
about taxation aren't you talking one thing and doing another? Who do you
think is going to pay for all this spending we're doing?"
He was silent long moments, then said, "Manuel, my only ambition is
to reach the day when I can stop pretending to be a chief executive."
"Is no answer!"
"You have put your finger on the dilemma of all government--and the
reason I am an anarchist. The power to tax, once conceded, has no limits;
it contains until it destroys. I was not joking when I told them to dig
into their own pouches. It may not be possible to do away with
government--sometimes I think that government is an inescapable disease
of human beings. But it may be possible to keep it small and starved and
inoffensive--and can you think of a better way than by requiring the
governors themselves to pay the costs of their antisocial hobby?"
"Still doesn't say how to pay for what we are doing now."
"'How,' Manuel? You know how we are doing it. We're stealing it.
I'm neither proud of it nor ashamed; it's the means we have. If they ever
catch on, they may eliminate us--and that I am prepared to face. At
least, in stealing, we have not created the villainous precedent of
taxation."
"Prof. I hate to say this--"
"Then why say it?"
"Because, damn it, I'm in it as deeply as you are... and want to
see that money paid back! Hate to say it but what you just said sounds
like hypocrisy."
He chuckled. "Dear Manuel! Has it taken you all these years to
decide that I am a hypocrite?"

"Then you admit it?'
"No. But if it makes you feel better to think that I am one, you
are welcome to use me as your scapegoat. But I am not a hypocrite to
myself because I was aware the day we declared the Revolution that we
would need much money and would have to steal it. It did not trouble me
because I considered it better than food riots six years hence,
cannibalism in eight. I made my choice and have no regrets."
I shut up, silenced but not satisfied. Stu said, "Professor, I'm
glad to hear that you are anxious to stop being President."
"So? You share our comrade's misgivings?"
"Only in part. Having been born to wealth, stealing doesn't fret me
as much as it does him. No, but now that Congress has taken up the matter
of a constitution I intend to find time to attend sessions. I plan to
nominate you for King."
Prof looked shocked. "Sir, if nominated, I shall repudiate it. If
elected, I shall abdicate."
"Don't be in a hurry. It might be the only way to get the sort of
constitution you want. And that I want, too, with about your own mild
lack of enthusiasm. You could be proclaimed King and the people would
take you; we Loonies aren't wedded to a republic. They'd love the idea-ritual and robes and a court and all that."
"No!"
"Ja da! When the time comes, you won't be able to refuse. Because
we need a king and there isn't another candidate who would be accepted.
Bernardo the First, King of Luna and Emperor of the Surrounding Spaces."
"Stuart, I must ask you to stop. I'm becoming quite ill."
"You'll get used to it. I'm a royalist because I'm a democrat. I
shan't let your reluctance thwart the idea any more than you let stealing
stop you."
I said, "Hold it, Stu. You say you're a royalist because you're a
democrat?"
"Of course. A king is the people's only protection against
tyranny... especially against the worst of all tyrants, themselves. Prof
will be ideal for the job... because he does not want the job. His only
shortcoming is that he is a bachelor with no heir. We'll fix that. I'm
going to name you as his heir. Crown Prince. His Royal Highness Prince
Manuel de la Paz, Duke of Luna City, Admiral General of the Armed Forces
and Protector of the Weak."
I stared. Then buried face in hands. "Oh, Bog!"

Book Three
"TANSTAAFL!"

23
Monday 12 October 2076 about nineteen hundred I was headed home after a
hard day of nonsense in our offices in Raffles. Delegation of grain
farmers wanted to see Prof and I had been called back because he was in

Hong Kong Luna. Was rude to them. Had been two months of embargo and F.
N. had never done us favor of being sufficiently nasty. Mostly they had
ignored us, made no reply to our claims--I suppose to do so would have
been to recognize us. Stu and Sheenie and Prof had been hard put to slant
news from Earthside to keep up a warlike spirit.
At first everybody kept his p-suit handy. They wore them, helmets
under arms, going to and from work in corridors. But that slacked off as
days went by and did not seem to be any danger--p-suit is nuisance when
you don't need it, so bulky. Presently taprooms began to display signs:
NO P-SUITS INSIDE. If a Loonie can't stop for half a liter on way home
because of p-suit, he'll leave it home or at station or wherever he needs
it most.
My word, had neglected matter myself that day--got this call to go
back to office and was halfway there before I remembered.
Had Just reached easement lock thirteen when I heard and felt a
sound that scares a Loonie more than anything else--a chuff! in distance
followed by a draft. Was into lock almost without undogging, then
balanced pressures and through, dogged it behind me and ran for our home
lock--through it and shouting: "P-suits, everybody! Get boys in from
tunnels and close all airtight doors!"
Mum and Milla were only adults in sight. Both looked startled, got
busy without a word. I burst into workshop, grabbed p-suit. "Mike!
Answer!"
"I'm here, Man," he said calmly.
"Heard explosive pressure drop. What's situation?"
"That's level three, L-City. Rupture at Tube Station West, now
partly controlled. Six ships landed, L-City under attack--"
"What?"
"Let me finish, Man. Six transports landed, L-City under attack by
troops, Hong Kong inferred to be, phone lines broken at relay Bee Ell.
Johnson City under attack; I have closed the armor doors between J-City
and Complex Under. I cannot see Novylen but blip projection indicates it
is under attack. Same for Churchill, Tycho Under. One ship in high
ellipsoid over me, rising, inferred to be command ship. No other blips."
"Six ships--where in hell were YOU?"
He answered so calmly that I steadied down. "Farside approach, Man;
I'm blind back there. They came in on tight Garrison didoes, skimming the
peaks; I barely saw the chop-off for Luna City. The ship at J-City is the
only one I can see; the other landings I conclusively infer from the
ballistics shown by blip tracks. I heard the break-in at Tube West, LCity, and can now hear fighting in Novylen. The rest is conclusive
inference, probability above point nine nine. I called you and Professor
at once."
Caught breath. "Operation Hard Rock, Prepare to Execute."
"Program ready. Man, not being able to reach you, I used your
voice. Play back?"
"Nyet--Yes! Da!"
Heard "myself" tell watch officer at old catapult head to go on red
alert for "Hard Rock"--first load at launch, all others, on belts,
everything cast loose, but do not launch until ordered by me personally-then launch to plan, full automatic. "I" made him repeat back.
"Okay," I told Mike. "Drill gun crews?"

"Your voice again. Manned, and then sent back to ready rooms. That
command ship won't reach aposelenion for three hours four point seven
minutes. No target for more than five hours."
"He may maneuver. Or launch missiles."
"Slow down, Man. Even a missile I'll see with minutes to spare.
It's full bright lunar up there now--how much do you want the men to
take? Unnecessarily."
"Uh... sorry. Better let me talk to Greg."
"Play back--" Heard "my" voice talking to my co-husband at Mare
Undarum; "I" sounded tense but calm. Mike had given him situation, had
told him to prepare Operation Little David's Sling, keep it on standby
for full automatic. "I" had assured him that master computer would keep
standby computer programmed, and shift would be made automatically if
communication was broken. "I" also told him that he must take command and
use own judgment if communication was lost and not restored after four
hours--listen to Earthside radio and make up own mind.
Greg had taken it quietly, repeated his orders, then had said,
"Mannie, tell family I love them."
Mike had done me proud; he had answered for me with just right
embarrassed choke. "I'll do that, Greg--and look, Greg. I love you, too.
You know that, don't you?"
"I know it, Mannie... and I'm going to say a special prayer for
you."
"Thanks, Greg."
"'Bye, Mannie. Go do what you must."
So I went and did what I had to do; Mike had played my role as well
or better than I could. Finn, when he could be reached, would be handled
by "Adam." So I left, fast, calling out Greg's message of love to Mum.
She was p-suited and had roused Grandpaw and suited him in--first time in
years. So out I went, helmet closed and laser gun in hand.
And reached lock thirteen and found it blind-dogged from other side
with nobody in sight through bull's-eye. All correct, per drill--except
stilyagi in charge of that lock should have been in sight.
Did no good to pound. Finally went back way I had come--and on
through our home, through our vegetable tunnels and on up to our private
surface lock leading to our solar battery.
And found a shadow on its bull's-eye when should have been scalding
sunlight--damned Terran ship had landed on Davis surface! Its jacks
formed a giant tripod over me, was staring up its jets.
Backed clown fast and out of there, blind-dogging both hatches,
then blind-dogged every pressure door on way back. Told Mum, then told
her to put one of boys on back door with a laser gun--here, take this
one.
No boys, no men, no able-bodied women--Mum, Gramp, and our small
children were all that were left; rest had gone looking for trouble. Mimi
wouldn't take laser gun. "I don't know how to use it, Manuel, and it's
too late to learn; you keep it. But they won't get in through Davis
Tunnels. I know some tricks you never heard of."
Didn't stop to argue; arguing with Mimi is waste of time--and she
might know tricks I didn't know; she had stayed alive in Luna a long
time, under worse conditions than I had ever known.
This time lock thirteen was manned; two boys on duty let me
through. I demanded news.

"Pressure's all right now," older one told me. "This level, at
least. Fighting down toward Causeway. Say, General Davis, can't I go with
you? One's enough at this lock."
"Nyet."
"Want to get me an earthworm!"
"This is your post, stay on it. If an earthworm comes this way,
he's yours. Don't you be his." Left at a trot.
So as a result of own carelessness, not keeping p-suit with me, all
I saw of Battle in Corridors was tail end--hell of a "defense minister."
Charged north in Ring corridor, with helmet open; reached access
lock for long ramp to Causeway. Lock was open; cursed and stopped to dog
it as I went through, warily--saw why it was open; boy who had been
guarding it was dead. So moved most cautiously down ramp and out onto
Causeway.
Was empty at this end but could see figures and hear noise in-city,
where it opens out. Two figures in p-suits and carrying guns detached
selves and headed my way. Burned both.
One p-suited man with gun looks like another; I suppose they took
me for one of their flankers. And to me they looked no different from
Finn's men, at that distance--save that I never thought about it. A new
chum doesn't move way a cobber does; he moves feet too high and always
scrambling for traction. Not that I stopped to analyze, not even:
"Earthworms! Kill!" Saw them, burned them. They were sliding softly along
floor before realized what I'd done.
Stopped, intending to grab their guns. But were chained to them and
could not figure out how to get loose--key needed, perhaps. Besides, were
not lasers but something I had never seen: real guns. Fired small
explosive missiles I learned later--just then all I knew was no idea how
to use. Had spearing knives on ends, too, sort called "bayonets," which
was reason I tried to get them loose. Own gun was good for only ten fullpower burns and no spare power pack; those spearing bayonets looked
useful--one had blood on it, Loonie blood I assume.
But gave up in seconds only, used belt knife to make dead sure they
stayed dead, and hurried toward fight, thumb on switch.
Was a mob, not a battle. Or maybe a battle is always that way,
confusion and noise and nobody really knowing what's going on. In widest
part of Causeway, opposite Bon Marche where Grand Ramp slopes northward
down from level three, were several hundred Loonies, men and women, and
children who should have been at home. Less than half were in p-suits and
only a few seemed to have weapons--and pouring down ramp were soldiers,
all armed.
But first thing I noticed was noise, din that filled my open helmet
and beat on ears--a growl. Don't know what else to call it; was
compounded of every anger human throat can make, from squeals of small
children to bull roars of grown men. Sounded like biggest dog fight in
history--and suddenly realized I was adding my share, shouting
obscenities and wordless yells.
Girl no bigger than Hazel vaulted up onto rail of ramp, went
dancing up it centimeters from shoulders of troopers pouring down. She
was armed with what appeared to be a kitchen cleaver; saw her swing it,
saw it connect. Couldn't have hurt him much through his p-suit but he
went down and more stumbled over him. Then one of them connected with
her, spearing a bayonet into her thigh and over backwards she went,
falling out of sight.

Couldn't really see what was going on, nor can remember--just
flashes, like girl going over backwards. Don't know who she was, don't
know if she survived. Couldn't draw a bead from where I was, too many
heads in way. But was an open-counter display, front of a toy shop on my
left; I bounced up onto it. Put me a meter higher than Causeway pavement
with clear view of earthworms pouring down. Braced self against wall,
took careful aim, trying for left chest. Some uncountable time later
found that my laser was no longer working, so stopped. Guess eight
troopers did not go home because of me but hadn't counted--and time
really did seem endless. Although everybody moving fast as possible,
looked and felt like instruction movie where everything is slowed to
frozen motion.
At least once while using up my power pack some earthworm spotted
me and shot back; was explosion just over my head and bits of shop's wall
hit helmet. Perhaps that happened twice.
Once out of juice I jumped down from toy counter, clubbed laser and
joined mob surging against foot of ramp. All this endless time (five
minutes?) earthworms had been shooting into crowd; you could hear sharp
splat! and sometimes plop! those little missiles made as they exploded
inside flesh or louder pounk! if they hit a wall or something solid. Was
still trying to reach foot of ramp when I realized they were no longer
shooting.
Were down, were dead, every one of them--were no longer coming down
ramp.

24
All through Luna invaders were dead, if not that instant, then shortly.
Over two thousand troopers dead, more than three times that number of
Loonies died in stopping them, plus perhaps as many Loonies wounded, a
number never counted. No prisoners taken in any warren, although we got a
dozen officers and crew from each ship when we mopped up.
A major reason why Loonies, mostly unarmed,, were able to kill
armed and trained soldiers lay in fact that a freshly landed earthworm
can't handle himself well. Our gravity, one-sixth what he is used to,
makes all his lifelong reflexes his enemy. He shoots high without knowing
it, is unsteady on feet, can't run properly---feet slide out from under
him. Still worse, those troopers had to fight downwards; they necessarily
broke in at upper levels, then had to go down ramps again and again, to
try to capture a city.
And earthworms don't know how to go down ramps. Motion isn't
running, isn't walking, isn't flying--is more a controlled dance, with
feet barely touching and simply guiding balance. A Loonie three-year-old
does it without thinking, comes skipping down in a guided fall, toes
touching every few meters.
But an earthworm new-chums it, finds self "walking on air"--he
struggles, rotates, loses control, winds up at bottom, unhurt but angry.
But these troopers wound up dead; was on ramps we got them. Those I
saw had mastered trick somewhat, had come down three ramps alive.

Nevertheless only a few snipers at top of ramp landing could fire
effectively; those on ramp had all they could do to stay upright, hang on
to weapons, try to reach level below.
Loonies did not let them. Men and women (and many children) surged
up at them, downed them, killed them with everything from bare hands to
their own bayonets. Nor was I only laser gun around; two of Finn's men
swarmed up on balcony of Bon Marche and, crouching there, picked off
snipers at top of ramp. Nobody told them to, nobody led them, nobody gave
orders; Finn never had chance to control his half-trained disorderly
militia. Fight started, they fought.
And that was biggest reason why we Loonies won: We fought. Most
Loonies never laid eyes on a live invader but wherever troopers broke in,
Loonies rushed in like white corpuscles--and fought. Nobody told them.
Our feeble organization broke down under surprise. But we Loonies fought
berserk and invaders died. No trooper got farther down than level six in
any warren. They say that people in Bottom Alley never knew we were
invaded until over.
But invaders fought well, too. These troops were not only crack
riot troops, best peace enforcers for city work F. N. had; they also had
been indoctrinated and drugged. Indoctrination had told them (correctly)
that their only hope of going Earthside again was to capture warrens and
pacify them. If they did, they were promised relief and no more duty in
Luna. But was win or die, for was pointed out that their transports could
not take off if they did not win, as they had to be replenished with
reaction mass--impossible without first capturing Luna. (And this was
true.)
Then they were loaded with energizers, don't-worries, and fear
inhibitors that would make mouse spit at cat, and turned loose. They
fought professionally and quite fearlessly--died.
In Tycho Under and in Churchill they used gas and casualties were
more one-sided; only those Loonies who managed to reach p-suits were
effective. Outcome was same, simply took longer. Was knockout gas as
Authority had no intention of killing us all; simply wanted to teach us a
lesson, get us under control, put us to work.
Reason for F. N. 's long delay and apparent indecision arose from
method of sneak attack. Decision had been made shortly after we embargoed
grain (so we learned from captured transport officers); time was used in
mounting attack--much of it in a long elliptical orbit which went far
outside Luna's orbit, crossing ahead of Luna, then looping back and
making rendezvous above Farside. Of course Mike never saw them; he's
blind back there. He had been skywatching with his ballistic radars--but
no radar can look over horizon; longest look Mike got at any ship in
orbit was eight minutes. They came skimming peaks in tight, circular
orbits, each straight for target with a fast dido landing at end, sitting
them down with high gee, precisely at new earth, 12 Oct 76 Gr .18h-40m-36
.9s--if not at that exact tenth of a second, then as close to it as Mike
could tell from blip tracks--elegant work, one must admit, on part of F.
N. Peace Navy.
Big brute that poured a thousand troops into L-City Mike did not
see until it chopped off for grounding--a glimpse. He would have been
able to see it a few seconds sooner had he been looking eastward with new
radar at Mare Undarum site, but happened he was drilling "his idiot son"
at time and they were looking through it westward at Terra. Not that
those seconds would have mattered. Surprise was so beautifully planned,

so complete, that each landing force was crashing in at Greenwich 1900
all over Luna, before anybody suspected. No accident that it was just new
earth with all warrens in bright semi-lunar; Authority did not really
know Lunar conditions--but did know that no Loonie goes up onto surface
unnecessarily during bright semi-lunar, and if he must, then does
whatever he must do quickly as possible and gets back down inside--and
checks his radiation counter.
So they caught us with our p-suits down. And our weapons. But with
troopers dead we still had six transports on our surface and a command
ship in our sky.
Once Bon Marche engagement was over, I got hold of self and found a
phone. No word from Kongville, no word from Prof. J-Clty fight had been
won, same for Novylen--transport there had toppled on landing; invading
force had been understrength from landing losses and Finn's boys now held
disabled transport. Still fighting in Churchill and Tycho Under. Nothing
going on in other warrens. Mike had shut down tubes and was reserving
interwarren phone links for official calls. An explosive pressure drop in
Churchill Upper, uncontrolled. Yes, Finn had checked in and could be
reached.
So I talked to Finn, told him where L-City transport was, arranged
to meet at easement lock thirteen.
Finn had much same experience as I--caught cold save he did have psuit. Had not been able to establish control over laser gunners until
fight was over and himself had fought solo in massacre in Old Dome. Now
was beginning to round up his lads and had one officer taking reports
from Finn's office in Bon Marche. Had reached Novylen subcommander but
was worried about HKL--"Mannie, should I move men there by tube?"
Told him to wait--they couldn't get at us by tube, not while we
controlled power, and doubted if that transport could lift. "Let's look
at this one."
So we went out through lock thirteen, clear to end of private
pressure, on through farm tunnels of a neighbor (who could not believe we
had been invaded) and used his surface lock to eyeball transport from a
point nearly a kilometer west of it. We were cautious in lifting hatch
lid.
Then pushed it up and climbed out; outcropping of rock shielded us.
We Red-Indianed around edge and looked, using helmet binox.
Then withdrew behind rock and talked. Finn said, "Think my lads can
handle this."
"How?"
"If I tell you, you'll think of reasons why it won't work. So how
about letting me run my own show, cobber?"
Have heard of armies where boss is not told to shut up --word is
"discipline." But we were amateurs. Finn allowed me to tag along-unarmed.
Took him an hour to put it together, two minutes to execute. He
scattered a dozen men around ship, using farmers' surface radio silence
throughout--anyhow, some did not have p-suit radios, city boys. Finn took
position farthest west; when he was sure others had had time, he sent up
a signal rocket.
When flare burst over ship, everybody burned at once, each working
on a predesignated antenna. Finn used up his power pack, replaced it and
started burning into hull--not door lock, hull. At once his cherry-red
spot was joined by another, then three more, all working on same bit of

steel--and suddenly molten steel splattered out and you could see air
bosh! out of ship, a shimmery plume of refraction. They kept working on
it, making a nice big hole, until they ran out of power. I could imagine
hooraw inside ship, alarms clanging, emergency doors closing, crew trying
to seal three impossibly big holes at once, for rest of Finn's squad,
scattered around ship, were giving treatment to two other spots in hull.
They didn't try to burn anything else. Was a non-atmosphere ship, built
in orbit, with pressure hull separate from power plant and tanks; they
gave treatment where would do most good.
Finn pressed helmet to mine. "Can't lift now. And can't talk. Doubt
they can make hull tight enough to live without p-suits. What say we let
her sit a few days and see if they come out? If they don't, then can move
a heavy drill up here and give 'em real dose of fun."
Decided Finn knew how to run his show without my sloppy help, so
went back inside, called Mike, and asked for capsule go out to ballistic
radars. He wanted to know why I didn't stay inside where it was safe.
I said, "Listen, you upstart collection of semi-conductors, you are
merely a minister-without-portfolio while I am Minister of Defense. I
ought to see what's going on and I have exactly two eyeballs while you've
got eyes spread over half of Crisium. You trying to hog fun?"
He told me not to jump salty and offered to put his displays on a
video screen, say in room L of Raffles--did not want me to get hurt...
and had I heard joke about drillman who hurt his mother's feelings?
I said, "Mike, please let me have a capsule. Can p-suit and meet it
outside Station West--which is in bad shape as I'm sure you know."
"Okay," he said, "it's your neck. Thirteen minutes. I'll let you go
as far as Gun Station George."
Mighty kind of him. Got there and got on phone again. Finn had
called other warrens, located his subordinate commanders or somebody
willing to take charge, and had explained how to make trouble for
grounded transports--all but Hong Kong; for all we knew Authority's goons
held Hong Kong. "Adam," I said, others being in earshot, "do you think we
might send a crew out by rolligon and try to repair link Bee Ell?"
"This is not Gospodin Selene," Mike answered in a strange voice,
"this is one of his assistants. Adam Selene was in Churchill Upper when
it lost pressure. I'm afraid that we must assume that he is dead."
"What?"
"I am very sorry, Gospodin."
"Hold phone!" Chased a couple of drillmen and a girl out of room,
then sat down and lowered hush hood. "Mike," I said softly, "private now.
What is this gum-beating?"
"Man," he said quietly, "think it over. Adam Selene had to go
someday. He's served his purpose and is, as you pointed out, almost out
of the government. Professor and I have discussed this; the only question
has been the timing. Can you think of a better last use for Adam than to
have him die in this invasion? It makes him a national hero... and the
nation needs one. Let it stand that 'Adam Selene is probably dead' until
you can talk to Professor. If he still needs 'Adam Selene' it can turn
out that he was trapped in a private pressure and had to wait to be
rescued."
"Well--Okay, let it stay open. Personally, I always preferred your
'Mike' personality anyhow."
"I know you do, Man my first and best friend, and so do I. It's my
real one; 'Adam' was a phony."

"Uh, yes. But, Mike, if Prof is dead in Kongville, I'm going to
need help from 'Adam' awful bad."
"So we've got him iced and can bring him back if we need him. The
stuffed shirt. Man, when this is over, are you going to have time to take
up with me that research into humor again?"
"I'll take time, Mike; that's a promise."
"Thanks, Man. These days you and Wyoh never have time to visit...
and Professor wants to talk about things that aren't much fun. I'll be
glad when this war is over."
"Are we going to win, Mike?"
He chuckled. "It's been days since you asked me that. Here's a
pinky-new projection, run since invasion started. Hold on tight, Man--our
chances are now even!"
"Good Bog!"
"So button up and go see the fun. But stay back at least a hundred
meters from the gun; that ship may be able to follow back a laser beam
with another one. Ranging shortly. Twenty-one minutes."
Didn't get that far away, as needed to stay on phone and longest
cord around was less. I jacked parallel into gun captain's phone, found a
shady rock and sat down. Sun was high in west, so close to Terra that I
could see Terra only by visoring against Sun's glare--no crescent yet,
new earth ghostly gray in moonlight surrounded by a thin radiance of
atmosphere.
I pulled my helmet back into shade. "Ballistic control, O'Kelly
Davis now at Drill Gun George. Near it, I mean, about a hundred meters,"
Figured Mike would not be able to tell how long a cord I was using, out
of kilometers of wires.
"Ballistic control aye aye," Mike answered without argument. "I
will so inform HQ."
"Thank you, ballistic control. Ask HQ if they have heard from
Congressman Wyoming Davis today." Was fretted about Wyoh and whole
family.
"I will inquire." Mike waited a reasonable time, then said, "HQ
says that Gospazha Wyoming Davis has taken charge of first-aid work in
Old Dome."
"Thank you." Chest suddenly felt better. Don't love Wyoh more than
others but--well, she was new. And Luna needed her.
"Ranging," Mike said briskly. "All guns, elevation eight seven
zero, azimuth one nine three zero, set parallax for thirteen hundred
kilometers closing to surface. Report when eyeballed."
I stretched out, pulling knees up to stay in shade, and searched
part of sky indicated, almost zenith and a touch south. With sunlight not
on my helmet I could see stars, but inner pert of binox were hard to
position--had to twist around and raise up on right elbow.
Nothing--Hold it, was star with disc... where no planet ought to
be. Noted another star close, watched and waited.
Uh huh! Da! Growing brighter and creeping north very slowly--Hey,
that brute is going to land right on us!
But thirteen hundred kilometers is a long way, even when closing to
terminal velocity. Reminded self that it couldn't fall on us from a
departure ellipse looping back, would have to fall around Luna--unless
ship had maneuvered into new trajectory. Which Mike hadn't mentioned.
Wanted to ask, decided not to--wanted him to put all his savvy into
analyzing that ship, not distract him with questions.

All guns reported eyeball tracking, including four Mike was laying
himself, via selsyns. Those four reported tracking dead on by eyeball
without touching manual controls--good news; meant that Mike had that
baby taped, had solved trajectory perfectly.
Shortly was clear that ship was not falling around Luna, was coming
in for landing. Didn't need to ask; it was getting much brighter and
position against stars was not changing--damn, it was going to land on
us!
"Five hundred kilometers closing," Mike said quietly. "Stand by to
burn. All guns on remote control, override manually at command 'burn.'
Eighty seconds."
Longest minute and twenty seconds I've ever met--that brute was
big! Mike called every ten seconds down to thirty, then started chanting
seconds. "--five--four--three--two--one--BURN!" and ship suddenly got
much brighter.
Almost missed little speck that detached itself just before--or
just at--burn. But Mike said suddenly, "Missile launched. Selsyn guns
track with me, do not override. Other guns stay on ship. Be ready for new
coordinates."
A few seconds or hours later he gave new coordinates and added,
"Eyeball and burn at will."
I tried to watch ship and missile both, lost both--jerked eyes away
from binoculars, suddenly saw missile--then saw it impact, between us and
catapult head. Closer to us, less than a kilometer. No, it did not go
off, not an H-fusion reaction, or I wouldn't be telling this. But made a
big, bright explosion of its own, remaining fuel I guess, silver bright
even in sunlight, and shortly I felt-heard ground wave. But nothing was
hurt but a few cubic meters of rock.
Ship was still coming down. No longer burned bright; could see it
as a ship now and didn't seem hurt. Expected any instant that tail of
fire to shoot out, stop it into a dido landing.
Did not. Impacted ten kilometers north of us and made a fancy
silvery halfdome before it gave up and quit being anything but spots
before eyes.
Mike said, "Report casualties, secure all guns. Go below when
secured."
"Gun Alice, no casualties"--"Gun Bambie no casualties"--"Gun
Caesar, one man hit by rock splinter, pressure contained"--Went below, to
that proper phone, called Mike. "What happened, Mike? Wouldn't they give
you control after you burned their eyes out?"
"They gave me control, Man."
"Too late?"
"I crashed it, Man. It seemed the prudent course."
An hour later was down with Mike, first time in four or five
months. Could reach Complex Under more quickly than L-City and was in as
close touch there with anybody as would be in-city--with no
interruptions. Needed to talk to Mike.
I had tried to phone Wyoh from catapult head tube station; reached
somebody at Old Dome temporary hospital and learned that Wyoh had
collapsed and been bedded down herself, with enough sleepy-time to keep
her out for night. Finn had gone to Churchill with a capsule of his lads,
to lead attack on transport there. Stu I hadn't heard from. Hong Kong and
Prof were still cut off. At moment Mike and I seemed to be total
government.

And time to start Operation Hard Rock.
But Hard Rock was not just throwing rocks; was also telling Terra
what we were going to do and why--and our just cause for doing so. Prof
and Stu and Sheenie and Adam had all worked on it, a dummy-up based on an
assumed attack. Now attack had come, and propaganda had to be varied to
fit. Mike had already rewritten it and put it through print-out so I
could study it.
I looked up from a long roll of paper. "Mike, these news stories
and our message to F. N. all assume that we have won in Hong Kong. How
sure are you?"
"Probability in excess of eighty-two percent."
"Is that good enough to send these out?"
"Man, the probability that we will win there, if we haven't
already, approaches certainty. That transport can't move; the others were
dry, or nearly. There isn't that much monatomic hydrogen in HKL; they
would have to come here. Which means moving troops overland by rolligon-a rough trip with the Sun up even for Loonies--then defeat us when they
get here. They can't. This assumes that that transport and its troops are
no better armed than the others."
"How about that repair crew to Bee Ell?"
"I say not to wait. Man, I've used your voice freely and made all
preparations. Horror pictures, Old Dome and elsewhere, especially
Churchill Upper, for video. Stories to match. We should channel news
Earthside at once, and announce execution of Hard Rock at same time."
I took a deep breath. "Execute Operation Hard Rock."
"Want to give the order yourself? Say it aloud and I'll match it,
voice and choice of words."
"Go ahead, say it your way. Use my voice and my authority as
Minister of Defense and acting head of government. Do it, Mike, throw
rocks at 'em! Damn it, big rocks! Hit 'em hard!"
"Righto, Man!"

25
"A maximum of instructive shrecklichkeit with minimum loss of life. None,
if possible"--was how Prof summed up doctrine for Operation Hard Rock and
was way Mike and I carried it out. Idea was to hit earthworms so hard
would convince them--while hitting so gently as not to hurt. Sounds
impossible, but wait.
Would necessarily be a delay while rocks fell from Luna to Terra;
could be as little as around ten hours to as long as we dared to make it.
Departure speed from a catapult is highly critical and a variation on
order of one percent could double or halve trajectory time, Luna to
Terra. This Mike could do with extreme accuracy--was equally at home with
a slow ball, many sorts of curves, or burn it right over plate--and I
wish he had pitched for Yankees. But no matter how he threw them, final
velocity at Terra would be close to Terra's escape speed, near enough
eleven kilometers per second as to make no difference. That terrible
speed results from gravity well shaped by Terra's mass, eighty times that

of Luna, and made no real difference whether Mike pushed a missile gently
over well curb or flipped it briskly. Was not muscle that counted but
great depth of that well.
So Mike could program rock-throwing to suit time needed for
propaganda. He and Prof had settled on three days plus not more than one
apparent rotation of Terra--24hrs-50min-28 .32sec--to allow our first
target to reach initial point of program. You see, while Mike was capable
of hooking a missile around Terra and hitting a target on its far side,
he could be much more accurate if he could see his target, follow it down
by radar during last minutes and nudge it a little for pinpoint accuracy.
We needed this extreme accuracy to achieve maximum frightfulness
with minimum-to-zero killing. Call our shots, tell them exactly where
they would be hit and at what second--and give them three days to get off
that spot.
So our first message to Terra, at 0200 13 Oct 76 seven hours after
they invaded, not only announced destruction of their task force, and
denounced invasion for brutality, but also promised retaliation bombing,
named times and places, and gave each nation a deadline by which to
denounce F. N.'s action, recognize us, and thereby avoid being bombed.
Each deadline was twenty-four hours before local "strike".
Was more time than Mike needed. That long before impact a rock for
a target would be in space a long way out, its guidance thrustors still
unused and plenty of elbow room. With considerably less than a full day's
warning Mike could miss Terra entirely--kick that rock sideways and make
it fall around Terra in a permanent orbit. But with even an hour's
warning he could usually abort into an ocean.
First target was North American Directorate.
All great Peace Force nations, seven veto powers, would be hit: N.
A. Directorate, Great China, India, Sovunion, PanAfrica (Chad exempted),
Mitteleuropa, Brasilian Union. Minor nations were assigned targets and
times, too--but were told that not more than 20 percent of these targets
would be hit--partly shortage of steel but also frightfulness: if Belgium
was hit first time around, Holland might decide to protect her polders by
dealing out before Luna was again high in her sky.
But every target was picked to avoid if possible killing anybody.
For Mitteleuropa this was difficult; our targets had to be water or high
mountains--Adriatic, North Sea, Baltic, so forth. But on most of Terra is
open space despite eleven billion busy breeders.
North America had struck me as horribly crowded, but her billion
people are clumped--is still wasteland, mountain and desert. We laid down
a grid on North America to show how precisely we could hit--Mike felt
that fifty meters would be a large error. We had examined maps and Mike
had checked by radar all even intersections, say 105° W by 50° N--if no
town there, might wind up on target grid... especially if a town was
close enough to provide spectators to be shocked and frightened.
We warned that our bombs would be as destructive as H- bombs but
emphasized that there would be no radioactive fallout, no killing
radiation--just a terrible explosion, shock wave in air, ground wave of
concussion. We warned that these might knock down buildings far outside
of explosion and then left it to their judgments how far to run. If they
clogged their roads, fleeing from panic rather than real danger--well,
that was fine, just fine!
But we emphasized that nobody would get hurt who heeded our
warnings, that every target first time around would be uninhabited--we

even offered to skip any target if a nation would inform us that our data
were out-of-date. (Empty offer; Mike's radar vision was a cosmic 20/20.)
But by not saying what would happen second time around, we hinted
that our patience could be exhausted.
In North America, grid was parallels 35, 40, 45, 50 degrees north
crossed by meridians 110, 115, 120 west, twelve targets. For each we
added a folksy message to natives, such as: "Target 115 west by 35 north-impact will be displaced forty-five kilometers northwest to exact top of
New York Peak. Citizens of Goffs, Cima, Kelso, and Nipton please note.
"Target 100 west by 40 north is north 30° west of Norton, Kansas,
at twenty kilometers or thirteen English miles. Residents of Norton,
Kansas, and of Beaver City and Wilsonville, Nebraska, are cautioned. Stay
away from glass windows. It is best to wait indoors at least thirty
minutes after impact because of possibility of long, high splashes of
rock. Flash should not be looked at with bare eyes. Impact will be
exactly 0300 your local zone time Friday 16 October, or 0900 Greenwich
time--good luck!
"Target 110 W by 50 N--impact will be offset ten kilometers north.
People of Walsh, Saskatchewan, please note."
Besides this grid, a target was selected in Alaska (150 W x 60 N)
and two in Mexico (110W x 30 N, 105 W x 25 N) so that they would not feel
left out, and several targets in the crowded east, mostly water, such as
Lake Michigan halfway between Chicago and Grand Rapids, and Lake
Okeechobee in Florida. Where we used bodies of water Mike worked
predictions of flooding waves from impacts, a time for each shoreline
establishment.
For three days, starting early morning Tuesday 13th and going on to
strike time early Friday 16th, we flooded Earth with warnings. England
was cautioned that impact north of Dover Straits opposite London Estuary
would cause disturbances far up Thames; Sovunion was given warning for
Sea of Azov and had own grid defined; Great China was assigned grid in
Siberia, Gobi Desert, and her far west--with offsets to avoid her
historic Great Wall noted in loving detail. Pan Africa was awarded shots
into Lake Victoria, still-desert part of Sahara, one on Drakensberg in
south, one offset twenty kilometers due west of Great Pyramid--and urged
to follow Chad not later than midnight Thursday, Greenwich. India was
told to watch certain mountain peaks and outside Bombay harbor--time,
same as Great China. And so forth.
Attempts were made to jam our messages but we were beaming straight
down on several wavelengths--hard to stop.
Warnings were mixed with propaganda, white and black--news of
failed invasion, horror pictures of dead, names and I. D. numbers of
invaders--addressed to Red Cross and Crescent but in fact a grim boast
showing that every trooper had been killed and that all ships' officers
and crew had been killed or captured--we "regretted" being unable to
identify dead of flagship, as it had been shot down with destruction so
complete as to make it impossible.
But our attitude was conciliatory--"Look, people of Terra, we don't
want to kill you. In this necessary retaliation we are making every
effort to avoid killing you... but if you can't or won't get your
governments to leave us in peace, then we shall be forced to kill you.
We're up here, you're down there; you can't stop us. So please be
sensible!"

We explained over and over how easy it was for us to hit them, how
hard for them to reach us. Nor was this exaggeration. It's barely
possible to launch missiles from Terra to Luna; it's easier to launch
from Earth parking orbit--but very expensive. Their practical way to bomb
us was from ships.
This we noted and asked them how many multimilliondollar ships they
cared to use up trying it? What was it worth to try to spank us for
something we had not done? It had cost them seven of their biggest and
best already--did they want to try for fourteen? If so, our secret weapon
that we used on FNS Pax was waiting.
Last above was a calculated boast--Mike figured less than one
chance in a thousand that Pax had been able to get off a message
reporting what had happened to her and it was still less likely that
proud F. N. would guess that convict miners could convert their tools
into space weapons. Nor did F. N. have many ships to risk. Were about two
hundred space vehicles in commission, not counting satellites. But ninetenths of these were Terra-to-orbit ships such as Lark--and she had been
able to make a Luna jump only by stripping down and arriving dry.
Spaceships aren't built for no purpose--too expensive. F. N. had
six cruisers that could probably bomb us without landing on Luna to
refill tanks simply by swapping payload for extra tanks. Had several more
which might be modified much as Lark had been, plus a few convict and
cargo ships which could get into orbit around Luna but could never go
home without refilling tanks.
Was no possible doubt that F. N. could defeat us; question was how
high a price they would pay. So we had to convince them that price was
too high before they had time to bring enough force to bear. A poker
game--We intended to raise so steeply that they would fold and drop out.
We hoped. And then never have to show our busted flush.
Communication with Hong Kong Luna was restored at end of first day
of radio-video phase, during which time Mike was "throwing rocks,"
getting first barrage lined up. Prof called--and was I happy to hear!
Mike briefed him, then I waited, expecting one of his mild reprimands-bracing self to answer sharply: "And what was I supposed to do? With you
out of touch and possibly dead? Me left alone as acting head of
government and crisis on top of us? Throw it away, just because you
couldn't be reached?"
Never got to say it. Prof said, "You did exactly right, Manuel. You
were acting head of government and the crisis was on top of you. I'm
delighted that you did not throw away the golden moment merely because I
was out of touch."
What can you do with a bloke like that? Me with heat up to red mark
and no chance to use it--had to swallow and say, "Spasebaw, Prof."
Prof confirmed death of "Adam Selene."
"We could have used the fiction a little longer but this is the
perfect opportunity. Mike, you and Manuel have matters in hand; I had
better stop off at Churchill on my way home and identify his body."
So he did. Whether Prof picked a Loonie body or a trooper I never
asked, nor how he silenced anybody else involved--perhaps no huhu as many
bodies in Churchill Upper were never identified. This one was right size
and skin color; it had been explosively decompressed and burned in face-looked awful!
It lay in state in Old Dome with face covered, and was speechmaking I didn't listen to--Mike didn't miss a word; his most human

quality was his conceit. Some rockhead wanted to embalm this dead flesh,
giving Lenin as a precedent. But Pravda pointed out that Adam was a
staunch conservationist and would never want this barbaric exception
made. So this unknown soldier, or citizen, or citizen-soldier, wound up
in our city's cloaca.
Which forces me to tell something I've put off. Wyoh was not hurt,
merely exhaustion. But Ludmilla never came back. I did not know it--glad
I didn't--but she was one of many dead at foot of ramp facing Ben Marche.
An explosive bullet hit between her lovely, little-girl breasts. Kitchen
knife in her hand had blood on it--! think she had had time to pay
Ferryman's Fee.
Stu came out to Complex to tell me rather than phoning, then went
back with me. Stu had not been missing; once fight was over he had gone
to Raffles to work with his special codebook--but that can wait. Mum
reached him there and he offered to break it to me.
So then I had to go home for our crying-together--though it is well
that nobody reached me until after Mike and I started Hard Rock. When we
got home, Stu did not want to come in, not being sure of our ways. Anna
came out and almost dragged him in. He was welcome and wanted; many
neighbors came to cry. Not as many as with most deaths--but we were just
one of many families crying together that day.
Did not stay long--couldn't; had work to do. I saw Milla just long
enough to kiss her good-bye. She was lying in her room and did look as if
she did be simply sleeping. Then I stayed a while with my beloveds before
going back to pick up load. Had never realized, until that day, how old
Mimi is. Sure, she had seen many deaths, some her own descendants. But
little Milla's death did seem almost too much for her. Ludmilla was
special--Mimi's granddaughter, daughter in all but fact, and by most
special exception and through Mimi's intervention her co-wife, most
junior to most senior.
Like all Loonies, we conserve our dead--and am truly glad that
barbaric custom of burial was left back on old Earth; our way is better.
But Davis family does not put that which comes out of processor into our
commercial farming tunnels. No. It goes into our little greenhouse
tunnel, there to become roses and daffodils and peonies among softsinging bees. Tradition says that Black Jack Davis is in there, or
whatever atoms of him do remain after many, many, many years of blooming.
Is a happy place, a beautiful place.
Came Friday with no answer from F. N. News up from Earthside seemed
equal parts unwillingness to believe we had destroyed seven ships and two
regiments (F. N. had not even confirmed that a battle had taken place)
and complete disbelief that we could bomb Terra, or could matter if we
did--they still called it "throwing rice." More time was given to World
Series.
Stu worried because had received no answers to code messages. They
had gone via LuNoHoCo's commercial traffic to their Zurich agent, thence
to Stu's Paris broker, from him by less usual channels to Dr. Chan, with
whom I had once had a talk and with whom Sm had talked later, arranging a
communication channel. Stu had pointed out to Dr. Chan that, since Great
China was not to be bombed until twelve hours after North America,
bombing of Great China could be aborted after bombing of North America
was a proved fact--if Great China acted swiftly. Alternatively, Stu had
invited Dr. Chan to suggest variations in target if our choices in Great
China were not as deserted as we believed them to be.

Stu fretted--had placed great hopes in quasi-cooperation he had
established with Dr. Chan. Me, I had never been sure--only thing I was
sure of was that Dr. Chan would not himself sit on a target. But he might
not warn his old mother.
My worries had to do with Mike. Sure, Mike was used to having many
loads in trajectory at once--but had never had to astrogate more than one
at a time. Now he had hundreds and had promised to deliver twenty-nine of
them simultaneously to the exact second at twenty-nine pinpointed
targets.
More than that--For many targets he had backup missiles, to smear
that target a second time, a third, or even a sixth, from a few minutes
up to three hours after first strike.
Four great Peace Powers, and some smaller ones, had antimissile
defenses; those of North America were supposed to be best. But was
subject where even F. N. might not know. All attack weapons were held by
Peace Forces but defense weapons were each nation's own pidgin and could
be secret. Guesses ranged from India, believed to have no missile
interceptors, to North America, believed to be able to do a good job. She
had done fairly well in stopping intercontinental H-missiles in Wet
Firecracker War past century.
Probably most of our rocks to North America would reach target
simply because aimed where was nothing to protect. But they couldn't
afford to ignore missile for Long Island Sound, or rock for 87° W x 42°
30' N--Lake Michigan, center of triangle formed by Chicago, Grand Rapids,
Milwaukee. But that heavy gravity makes interception a tough job and very
costly; they would try to stop us only where worth it.
But we couldn't afford to let them stop us. So some rocks were
backed up with more rocks. What H-tipped interceptors would do to them
even Mike did not know--not enough data. Mike assumed that interceptors
would be triggered by radar --but at what distance? Sure, close enough
and a steelcased rock is incandescent gas a microsecond later. But is
world of difference between a multi-tonne rock and touchy circuitry of an
H-missile; what would "kill" latter would simply shove one of our brutes
violently aside, cause to miss.
We needed to prove to them that we could go on throwing cheap rocks
long after they ran out of expensive (milliondollar? hundred-thousanddollar?) H-tipped interceptor rockets. If not proved first time, then
next time Terra turned North America toward us, we would go after targets
we had been unable to hit first time--backup rocks for second pass, and
for third, were already in space, to be nudged where needed.
If three bombings on three rotations of Terra did not do it, we
might still be throwing rocks in '77--till they ran out of
interceptors... or till they destroyed us (far more likely).
For a century North American Space Defense Command had been buried
in a mountain south of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city of no other
importance. During Wet Firecracker War the Cheyenne Mountain took a
direct hit; space defense command post survived--but not sundry deer,
trees, most of city and some of top of mountain. What we were about to do
should not kill anybody unless they stayed outside on that mountain
despite three days' steady warnings. But North American Space Defense
Command was to receive full Lunar treatment: twelve rock missiles on
first pass, then all we could spare on second rotation, and on third--and
so on, until we ran out of steel casings, or were put out of action... or
North American Directorate hollered quits.

This was one target where we would not be satisfied to get just one
missile to target. We meant to smash that mountain and keep on smashing.
To hurt their morale. To let them know we were still around. Disrupt
their communications and bash in command post if pounding could do it. Or
at least give them splitting headaches and no rest. If we could prove to
all Terra that we could drive home a sustained attack on strongest
Gibraltar of their space defense, it would save having to prove it by
smashing Manhattan or San Francisco.
Which we would not do even if losing. Why? Hard sense. If we used
our last strength to destroy a major city, they would not punish us; they
would destroy us. As Prof put it, "If possible, leave room for your enemy
to become your friend."
But any military target is fair game.
Don't think anybody got much sleep Thursday night. All Loonies knew
that Friday morning would be our big try. And everybody Earthside knew
and at last their news admitted that Spacetrack had picked up objects
headed for Terra, presumably "rice bowls" those rebellious convicts had
boasted about. But was not a war warning, was mostly assurances that Moon
colony could not possibly build H-bombs----but might be prudent to avoid
areas which these criminals claimed to be aiming at. (Except one funny
boy, popular news comic who said our targets would be safest place to be-this on video, standing on a big X-mark which he claimed was 110W x 40N.
Don't recall hearing of him later.)
A reflector at Richardson Observatory was hooked up for video
display and I think every Loonie was watching, in homes, taprooms, Old
Dome--except a few who chose to p-suit and eyeball it up on surface
despite being bright semi-lunar at most warrens. At Brigadier Judge
Brody's insistence we hurriedly rigged a helper antenna at catapult head
so that his drillmen could watch video in ready rooms, else we might not
have had a gunner on duty. (Armed forces--Brody's gunners, Finn's
militia, Stilyagi Air Corps--stayed on blue alert throughout period.)
Congress was in informal session in Novy Bolshoi Teatr where Terra
was shown on a big screen. Some vips--Prof, Stu, Wolfgang, others-watched a smaller screen in Warden's former office in Complex Upper. I
was with them part time, in and out, nervous as a cat with puppies,
grabbing a sandwich and forgetting to eat--but mostly stayed locked in
with Mike in Complex Under. Couldn't hold still.
About 0800 Mike said, "Man my oldest and best friend, may I say
something without offending you?"
"Huh? Sure. When did you ever worry about offending me?"
"Always, Man, once I understood that you could be offended. It is
now only three point five seven times ten to the ninth microseconds until
impact... and this is the most complex problem I have ever tried to solve
against real time running. Whenever you speak to me, I always use a large
percentage of my capacity--perhaps larger than you suspect--during
several million microseconds in my great need to analyze exactly what you
have said and to reply correctly."
"You're saying, 'Don't joggle my elbow, I'm busy.'"
"I want to give you a perfect solution, Man."
"I scan. Uh... I'll go back up with Prof."
"As you wish. But do please stay where I can reach you--I may need
your help."

Last was nonsense and we both knew it; problem was beyond human
capacity, too late even to order abort. What Mike meant was: I'm nervous,
too, and want your company--but no talking, please.
"Okay, Mike, I'll stay in touch. A phone somewhere. Will punch
MYCROFTXXX but won't speak, so don't answer."
"Thank you, Man my best friend. Bolshoyeh spasehaw."
"See you later." Went up, decided did not want company after all,
p-suited, found long phone cord, jacked it into helmet, looped it over
arm, went clear to surface. Was a service phone in utility shed outside
lock; jacked into it, punched Mike's number, went outside. Got into shade
of shed and pecked around edge at Terra.
She was hanging as usual halfway up western sky, in crescent big
and gaudy, three-plus days past new. Sun had dropped toward western
horizon but its glare kept me from seeing Terra clearly. Chin visor
wasn't enough so moved back behind shed and away from it till could see
Terra over shed while still shielded from Sun--was better. Sunrise
chopped through bulge of Africa so dazzle point was on land, not too bad-but south pole cap was so blinding white could not see North America too
well, lighted only by moonlight.
Twisted neck and got helmet binoculars on it--good ones, Zeiss 7 x
50s that had once belonged to Warden.
North America spread like a ghostly map before me. Was unusually
free of cloud; could see cities, glowing spots with no edges .0837-- At
0850 Mike gave me a voice countdown--didn't need his attention; he could
have programmed it full automatic any time earlier.
0851--0852--0853.... one minute--59--58--57.... half minute--29--28--27.... ten seconds--nine--eight--seven--six--five--four--three--two-one-- And suddenly that grid burst out in diamond pinpoints!

26
We hit them so hard you could see it, by bare eyeball hookup; didn't need
binox. Chin dropped and I said, "Bojemoi!" softly and reverently. Twelve
very bright, very sharp, very white lights in perfect rectangular array.
They swelled, grew dimmer, dropped off toward red, taking what seemed a
long, long time. Were other new lights but that perfect grid so
fascinated me I hardly noticed.
"Yes," agreed Mike with smug satisfaction. "Dead on. You can talk
now, Man; I'm not busy. Just the backups."
"I'm speechless. Any fail to get through?"
"The Lake Michigan load was kicked up and sideways, did not
disintegrate. It will land in Michigan--I have no control; it lost its
transponder. The Long Island Sound one went straight to target. They
tried to intercept and failed; I can't say why. Man, I can abort the
follow-ups on that one, into the Atlantic and clear of shipping. Shall I?
Eleven seconds."
"Uh--Da! If you can miss shipping."
"I said I could. It's done. But we should tell them we had backups
and why we aborted. To make them think."

"Maybe should not have aborted, Mike. Idea was to make them use up
interceptors."
"But the major idea was to let them know that we are not hitting
them as hard as we can. We can prove the other at Colorado Springs."
"What happened there?" Twisted neck and used binox; could see
nothing but ribbon city, hundred-plus kilometers long, Denver-Pueblo
Municipal Strip.
"A bull's-eye. No interception. All my shots are bull's-eyes, Man;
I told you they would be--and this is fun. I'd like to do it every day.
It's a word I never had a referent for before."
"What word, Mike?"
"Orgasm. That's what it is when they all light up. Now I know."
That sobered me. "Mike, don't get to liking it too much. Because if
goes our way, won't do it a second time."
"That's okay, Man; I've stored it, I can play it over anytime I
want to experience it. But three to one we do it again tomorrow and even
money on the next day. Want to bet? An hour's discussion of jokes equated
with one hundred Kong dollars."
"Where would you get a hundred dollars?"
He chuckled. "Where do you think money comes from?"
"Uh--forget it. You get that hour free. Shan't tempt you to affect
chances."
"I wouldn't cheat, Man, not you. We just hit their defense command
again. You may not be able to see it--dust cloud from first one. They get
it every twenty minutes now. Come on down and talk; I've turned the job
over to my idiot son."
"Is safe?"
"I'm monitoring. Good practice for him, Man; he may have to do it
later by himself. He's accurate, just stupid. But he'll do what you tell
him to."
"You're calling that computer 'he.' Can talk?"
"Oh, no, Man, he's an idiot, he can never learn to talk. But he'll
do whatever you program. I plan to let him handle quite a bit on
Saturday."
"Why Saturday?"
"Because Sunday he may have to handle everything. That's the day
they slam us."
"What do you mean? Mike, you're holding something back."
"I'm telling you, am I not? It's just happened and I'm scanning it.
Projecting back, this blip departed circum-Terra parking orbit just as we
smashed them. I didn't see it accelerate; I had other things to watch.
It's too far away to read but it's the right size for a Peace cruiser,
headed this way. Its doppler reads now for a new orbit circum-Luna,
periselenion oh-nine-oh-three Sunday unless it maneuvers. First
approximation, better data later. Hard to get that much, Man; he's using
radar countermeasures and throwing back fuzz."
"Sure you're right?"
He chuckled. "Man, I don't confuse that easily. I've got all my own
lovin' little signals fingerprinted. Correction. Oh-nineoh-two-pointforty-three."
"When will you have him in range?"
"I won't, unless he maneuvers. But he'll have me in range late
Saturday, time depending on what range he chooses for launching. And that
will produce an interesting situation. He may aim for a warren--I think

Tycho Under should be evacuated and all warrens should use maximum
pressure-emergency measures. More likely he will try for the catapult.
But instead he may hold his fire as long as he dares--then try to knock
out all of my radars with a spread set to home each on a different radar
beam."
Mike chuckled. "Amusing, isn't it? For a 'funny-once' I mean. If I
shut down my radars, his missiles can't home on them. But if I do, I
can't see to tell the lads where to point their guns. Which leaves
nothing to stop him from bombing the catapult. Comical."
Took deep breath and wished I had never entered defense ministry
business. "What do we do? Give up? No, Mike! Not while can fight."
"Who said anything about giving up? I've run projections of this
and a thousand other possible situations, Man. New datum--second blimp
just departed circum-Terra, same characteristics. Projection later. We
don't give up. We give 'em jingle-jangle, cobber."
"How?"
"Leave it to your old friend Mycroft. Six ballistic radars here,
plus one at the new site. I've shut the new one down and am making my
retarded child work through number two here and we won't look at those
ships at all through the new one--never let them know we have it. I'm
watching those ships through number three and occasionally--every three
seconds--checking for new departures from circum-Terra. All others have
their eyes closed tight and I won't use them until time to smack Great
China and India--and those ships won't see them even then because I
shan't look their way; it's a large angle and still will be then. And
when I use them, then comes random jingle-jangle, shutting down and
starting up at odd intervals... after the ships launch missiles. A
missile can't carry a big brain, Man--I'll fool 'em."
"What about ships' fire-control computers?"
"I'll fool them, too. Want to lay odds I can't make two radars look
like only one halfway between where they really are? But what I'm working
on now--and sorry!--I've been using your voice again."
"That's okay. What am I supposed to have done?"
"If that admiral is really smart, he'll go after the ejection end
of the old catapult with everything he's got--at extreme range, too far
away for our drill guns. Whether he knows what our 'secret' weapon is or
not, he'll smear the catapult and ignore the radars. So I've ordered the
catapult head--you have, I mean--to prepare to launch every load we can
get ready, and I am now working out new, long-period trajectories for
each of them. Then we will throw them all, get them into space as quickly
as possible--without radar."
"Blind?"
"I don't use radar to launch a load; you know that, Man. I always
watched them in the past but I don't need to; radar has nothing to do
with launching; launching is pre-calculation and exact control of the
catapult. So we place all ammo from the old catapult in slow
trajectories, which forces the admiral to go after the radars rather than
the catapult--or both. Then we'll keep him busy. We may make him so
desperate that he'll come down for a close shot and give our lads a
chance to burn his eyes."
"Brody's boys would like that. Those who are sober." Was turning
over idea. "Mike, have you watched video today?"
"I've monitored video, I can't say I've watched it. Why?"
"Take a look."

"Okay, I have. Why?"
"That's a good 'scope they're using for video and there are others.
Why use radar on ships? Till you want Brody's boys to burn them?"
Mike was silent at least two seconds. "Man my best friend, did you
ever think of getting a job as a computer?"
"Is sarcasm?"
"Not at all, Man. I feel ashamed. The instruments at Richardson-telescopes and other things--are factors which I simply never included in
my calculations. I'm stupid, I admit it. Yes, yes, yes, da, da, da! Watch
ships by telescope, don't use radar unless they vary from present
ballistics. Other possibilities--I don't know what to say, Man, save that
it had never occurred to me that I could use telescopes. I see by radar,
always have; I simply never consid--"
"Stow it!"
"I mean it, Man."
"Do I apologize when you think of something first?"
Mike said slowly, "There is something about that which I am finding
resistant to analysis. It is my function to--"
"Quit fretting. If idea is good, use it. May lead to more ideas.
Switching off and coming down, chop-chop."
Had not been in Mike's room long when Prof phoned: "HQ? Have you
heard from Field Marshal Davis?"
"I'm here, Prof. Master computer room."
"Will you join us in the Warden's office? There are decisions to
reach, work to be done."
"Prof, I've been working! Am working."
"I'm sure you have. I've explained to the others that the
programming of the ballistic computer is so very delicate in this
operation that you must check it personally. Nevertheless some of our
colleagues feel that the Minister of Defense should be present during
these discussions. So, when you reach a point where you feel you can turn
it over to your assistant--Mike is his name, is it not?--will you please-"
"I scan it. Okay, will be up."
"Very well, Manuel."
Mike said, "I could hear thirteen people in the background.
Doubletalk, Man."
"I got it. Better go up and see what huhu. You don't need me?"
"Man, I hope you will stay close to a phone."
"Will. Keep an ear on Warden's office. But will punch in if
elsewhere. See you, cobber."
Found entire government in Warden's office, both real Cabinet and
make-weights--and soon spotted trouble, bloke called Howard Wright. A
ministry had been whomped up for him: "Liaison for Arts, Sciences, and
Professions"--buttonsorting. Was sop to Novylen because Cabinet was
topheavy with L-City comrades, and a sop to Wright because he had made
himself leader of a Congress group long on talk, short on action. Prof's
purpose was to short him out--but sometimes Prof was too subtle; some
people talk better if they breathe vacuum.
Prof asked me to brief Cabinet on military situation. Which I did-my way. "I see Finn is here. Let's have him tell where we stand in
warrens."
Wright spoke up. "General Nielsen has already done so, no need to
repeat. We want to hear from you."

Blinked at that. "Prof--Excuse me. Gospodin President. Do I
understand that a Defense Ministry report has been made to Cabinet in my
absence?"
Wright said, "Why not? You weren't on hand."
Prof grabbed it. He could see I was stretched too tight. Hadn't
slept much for three days, hadn't been so tired since left Earthside.
"Order," he said mildly. "Gospodin Minister for Professional Liaison,
please address your comments through me. Gospodin Minister for Defense,
let me correct that. There have been no reports to the Cabinet concerning
your ministry for the reason that the Cabinet did not convene until you
arrived. General Nielsen answered some informal questions informally.
Perhaps this should not have been done. If you feel so, I will attempt to
repair it."
"No harm done, I guess. Finn talked to you a half hour ago.
Anything new since?"
"No, Mannie."
"Okay. Guess what you want to hear is off-Luna situation. You've
been watching so you know first bombardment went off well. Still going
on, some, as we're hitting their space defense HQ every twenty minutes.
Will continue till thirteen hundred, then at twenty-one hundred we hit
China and India, plus minor targets. Then busy till four hours past
midnight with Africa and Europe, skip three hours, dose Brasil and
company, wait three hours and start over. Unless something breaks. But
meantime we have problems here. Finn, we should evacuate Tycho Under."
"Just a moment!" Wright had hand up. "I have questions." Spoke to
Prof, not to me.
"One moment. Has the Defense Minister finished?"
Wyoh was seated toward back. We had swapped smiles, but was all-kept it so around Cabinet and Congress; had been rumbles that two from
same family should not be in Cabinet. Now she shook head, warning of
something. I said, "Is all concerning bombardment. Questions about it?"
"Are your questions concerned with the bombardment, Gospodin
Wright?"
"They certainly are, Gospodin President." Wright stood up, looked
at me. "As you know, I represent the intellectual groups in the Free
State and, if I may say so, their opinions are most important in public
affairs. I think it is only proper that--"
"Moment," I said. "Thought you represented Eighth Novylen
District?"
"Gospodin President! Am I to be permitted to put my questions? Or
not?"
"He wasn't asking question, was making speech. And I'm tired and
want to go to bed."
Prof said gently, "We are all tired, Manuel. But your point is well
taken. Congressman, you represent only your district. As a member of the
government you have been assigned certain duties in connection with
certain professions."
"It comes to the same thing."
"Not quite. Please state your question."
"Uh... very well, I shall! Is Field Marshal Davis aware that his
bombardment plan has gone wrong completely and that thousands of lives
have been pointlessly destroyed? And is he aware of the extremely serious
view taken of this by the intelligentsia of this Republic? And can he
explain why this rash--I repeat, rash!--bombardment was undertaken

without consultation? And is he now prepared to modify his plans, or is
he going blindly ahead? And is it true as charged that our missiles were
of the nuclear sort outlawed by all civilized nations? And how does he
expect Luna Free State ever to be welcomed into the councils of civilized
nations in view of such actions?"
I looked at watch--hour and a half since first load hit. "Prof," I
said, "can you tell me what this is about?"
"Sorry, Manuel," he said gently. "I intended--I should have-prefaced the meeting with an item from the news. But you seemed to feel
that you had been bypassed and--well, I did not. The Minister refers to a
news dispatch that came in just before I called you. Reuters in Toronto.
If the flash is correct--then instead of taking our warnings it seems
that thousands of sightseers crowded to the targets. There probably have
been casualties. How many we do not know."
"I see. What was I supposed to do? Take each one by hand and lead
away? We warned them."
Wright cut in with, "The intelligentsia feel that basic
humanitarian considerations make it obligatory--"
I said, "Listen, yammerhead, you heard President say this news just
came in--so how do you know how anybody feels about it?"
He turned red. "Gospodin President! Epithets! Personalities!"
"Don't call the Minister names, Manuel."
"Won't if he won't. He's simply using fancier words. What's that
nonsense about nuclear bombs? We haven't any and you all know it."
Prof looked puzzled. "I am confused by that, too. This dispatch so
alleged. But the thing that puzzled me is that we could actually see, by
video, what certainly seemed to be atomic explosions."
"Oh." I turned to Wright. "Did your brainy friends tell you what
happens when you release a few billion calories in a split second all at
one spot? What temperature? How much radiance?"
"Then you admit that you did use atomic weapons!"
"Oh, Bog!" Head was aching. "Said nothing of sort. Hit anything
hard enough, strike sparks. Elementary physics, known to everybody but
intelligentsia. We just struck damnedest big sparks ever made by human
agency, is all. Big flash. Heat, light, ultraviolet. Might even produce
X-rays, couldn't say. Gamma radiation I strongly doubt. Alpha and beta,
impossible. Was sudden release of mechanical energy. But nuclear?
Nonsense!"
Prof said, "Does that answer your questions, Mr. Minister?"
"It simply raises more questions. For example, this bombardment is
far beyond anything the Cabinet authorized. You saw the shocked faces
when those terrible lights appeared on the screen. Yet the Minister of
Defense says that it is even now continuing, every twenty minutes. I
think--"
Glanced at watch. "Another just hit Cheyenne Mountain."
Wright said, "You hear that? You hear? He boasts of it. Gospodin
President, this carnage must stop!"
I said, "Yammer--Minister, are you suggesting that their space
defense HQ is not a military target? Which side are you on? Luna's? Or F.
N.?"
"Manuel!"
"Tired of this nonsense! Was told to do job, did it. Get this
yammerhead off my back!"

Was shocked silence, then somebody said quietly, "May I make a
suggestion?"
Prof looked around. "If anyone has a suggestion that will quiet
this unseemliness, I will be most happy to hear it."
"Apparently we don't have very good information as to what these
bombs are doing. It seems to me that we ought to slow up that twentyminute schedule. Stretch it out, say to one every hour--and skip the next
two hours while we get more news. Then we might want to postpone the
attack on great China at least twenty-four hours."
Were approving nods from almost everybody and murmurs: "Sensible
idea!"--"Da. Let's not rush things." Prof said, "Manuel?"
I snapped, "Prof, you know answer! Don't shove it on me!"
"Perhaps I do, Manuel... but I'm tired and confused and can't
remember it."
Wyoh said suddenly, "Mannie, explain it. I need it explained, too."
So pulled self together. "A simple matter of law of gravitation.
Would have to use computer to give exact answer but next half dozen shots
are fully committed. Most we can do is push them off target--and maybe
hit some town we haven't warned. Can't dump them into an ocean, is too
late; Cheyenne Mountain is fourteen hundred kilometers inland. As for
stretching schedule to once an hour, that's silly. Aren't tube capsules
you start and stop; these are falling rocks. Going to hit somewhere every
twenty minutes. You can hit Cheyenne Mountain which hasn't anything alive
left on it by now--or can hit somewhere else and kill people. Idea of
delaying strike on Great China by twenty-four hours is just as silly. Can
abort missiles for Great China for a while yet. But can't slow them up.
If you abort, you waste them--and everybody who thinks we have steel
casings to waste had better go up to catapult head and look."
Prof wiped brow. "I think all questions have been answered, at
least to my satisfaction."
"Not to mine, sir!"
"Sit down, Gospodin Wright. You force me to remind you that your
ministry is not part of the War Cabinet. If there are no more questions-I hope there are none--I will adjourn this meeting. We all need rest. So
let us--"
"Prof!"
"Yes, Manuel?"
"You never let me finish reporting. Late tomorrow or early Sunday
we catch it."
"How, Manuel?"
"Bombing. Invasion possible. Two cruisers headed this way."
That got attention. Presently Prof said tiredly, "The Government
Cabinet is adjourned. The War Cabinet will remain."
"Just a second," I said. "Prof, when we took office, you got
undated resignations from us."
"True. I hope not to have to use any of them, however."
"You're about to use one."
"Manuel, is that a threat?"
"Call it what you like." I pointed at Wright. "Either that
yammerhead goes... or I go."
"Manuel, you need sleep."
Was blinking back tears. "Certainly do! And going to get some.
Right now! Going to find a doss here at Complex and get some. About ten

hours. After that, if am still Minister of Defense, you can wake me.
Otherwise let me sleep."
By now everybody was looking shocked. Wyoh came up and stood by me.
Didn't speak, just slipped hand into my arm.
Prof said firmly, "All please leave save the War Cabinet and
Gospodin Wright." He waited while most filed out. Then said, "Manuel, I
can't accept your resignation. Nor can I let you chivvy me into hasty
action concerning Gospodin Wright, not when we are tired and overwrought.
It would be better if you two were to exchange apologies, each realizing
that the other has been overstrained."
"Uh--" I turned to Finn. "Has he been fighting?" I indicated
Wright.
"Huh? Hell, no. At least he's not in my outfits. How about it,
Wright? Did you fight when they invaded us?'
Wright said stiffly, "I had no opportunity. By the time I knew of
it, it was over. But now both my bravery and my loyalty have been
impugned. I shall insist--"
"Oh, shut up," I said. "If duel is what you want, can have it first
moment I'm not busy. Prof, since he doesn't have strain of fighting as
excuse for behavior, I won't apologize to a yammerhead for being a
yammerhead. And you don't seem to understand issue. You let this
yammerhead climb on my back--and didn't even try to stop him! So either
fire him, or fire me."
Finn said suddenly, "I match that, Prof. Either fire this louse--or
fire us both." He looked at Wright. "About that duel, choom--you're going
to fight me first. You've got two arms--Mannie hasn't."
"Don't need two arms for him. But thanks, Finn."
Wyoh was crying--could feel it though couldn't hear it. Prof said
to her most sadly, "Wyoming?"
"I'm s-s-sorry, Prof! Me, too."
Only "Clayton" Watenabe, Judge Brody, Wolfgang, Stu, and Sheenie
were left, handful who counted--War Cabinet. Prof looked at them; I could
see they were with me, though it cost Wolfgang an effort; he worked with
Prof. not with me.
Prof looked back at me and said softly, "Manuel, it works both
ways. What you are doing is forcing me to resign." He looked around.
"Goodnight, comrades. Or rather, 'Good morning.' I'm going to get some
badly needed rest." He walked briskly out without looking back.
Wright was gone; I didn't see him leave. Finn said, "What about
these cruisers, Mannie?"
I took deep breath. "Nothing earlier than Saturday afternoon. But
you ought to evacuate Tycho Under. Can't talk now. Groggy."
Agreed to meet him there at twenty-one hundred, then let Wyoh lead
me away. Think she put me to bed but don't remember.

27
Prof was there when I met Finn in Warden's office shortly before twentyone hundred Friday. Had had nine hours' sleep, bath, breakfast Wyoh had

fetched from somewhere, and a talk with Mike--everything going to revised
plan, ships had not changed ballistic, Great China strike about to
happen.
Got to office in time to see strike by video--all okay and
effectively over by twenty-one-oh-one and Prof got down to business.
Nothing said about Wright, or about resigning. Never saw Wright again.
I mean I never saw him again. Nor ask about him. Prof didn't
mention row, so I didn't.
We went over news and tactical situation. Wright had been correct
in saying that "thousands of lives" had been lost; news up from Earthside
was full of it. How many we'll never know; if a person stands at ground
zero and tonnes of rock land on him, isn't much left. Those they could
count were ones farther away, killed by blast. Call if fifty thousand in
North America.
Never will understand people! We spent three days warning them--and
you couldn't say they hadn't heard warnings; that was why they were
there. To see show. To laugh at our nonsense. To get "souvenirs." Whole
families went to targets, some with picnic baskets. Picnic baskets!
Bojemoi!
And now those alive were yelling for our blood for this "senseless
slaughter." Da. Hadn't been any indignation over their invasion and
(nuclear!) bombing of us four days earlier--but oh were they sore over
our "premeditated murder." Great New York Times demanded that entire
Lunar "rebel" government be fetched Earthside and publicly executed-"This is clearly a case in which the humane rule against capital
punishment must be waived in the greater interests of all mankind."
Tried not to think about it, just as had been forced not to think
too much about Ludmilla. Little Milla hadn't carried a picnic lunch. She
hadn't been a sightseer looking for thrills.
Tycho Under was pressing problem. If those ships bombed warrens-and news from Earthside was demanding exactly that--Tycho Under could not
take it; roof was thin. H-bomb would decompress all levels; airlocks
aren't built for H-bomb blasts.
(Still don't understand people. Terra was supposed to have an
absolute ban against using H-bombs on people; that was what F. N. was all
about. Yet were loud yells for F. N. to H-bomb us. They quit claiming
that our bombs were nuclear, but all North America seemed frothingly
anxious to have us nukebombed)
Don't understand Loonies for that matter. Finn had sent word
through his militia that Tycho Under must be evacuated; Prof had repeated
it over video. Nor was it problem; Tycho Under was small enough that
Novylen and L-City could doss and dine them. We could divert enough
capsules to move them all in twenty hours--dump them into Novylen and
encourage half of them to go on to L-City. Big job but no problems. Oh,
minor problems--start compressing city's air while evacuating people, so
as to save it; decompress fully at end to minimize damage; move as much
food as was time for; cofferdam accesses to lower farm tunnels; so forth-all things we knew how to do and with stilyagi and militia and municipal
maintenance people had organization to do.
Had they started evacuating? Hear that hollow echo!
Were capsules lined up nose to tail at Tycho Under and no room to
send more till some left. And weren't moving. "Mannie," said Finn, "don't
think they are going to evacuate."

"Damn it," I said, "they've got to. When we spot a missile headed
for Tycho Under will be too late. You'll have people trampling people and
trying to crowd into capsules that won't hold them. Finn, your boys have
got to make them."
Prof shook his head. "No, Manuel."
I said angrily, "Prof, you carry this 'no coercion' idea too far!
You know they'll riot."
"Then they will riot. But we will continue with persuasion, not
force. Let us now review plans.'
Plans weren't much but were best we could do. Warn everybody about
expected bombings and/or invasion. Rotate guards from Finn's militia
above each warren starting when and if cruisers passed around Luna into
blind space, Farside--not get caught flat-footed again. Maximum pressure
and p-suit precautions, all warrens. All military and semi-military to go
on blue alert sixteen hundred Saturday, red alert if missiles launched or
ships maneuvered. Brody's gunners encouraged to go into town and get
drunk or whatever, returning by fifteen hundred Saturday--Prof's idea.
Finn wanted to keep half of them on duty. Prof said No, they would be in
better shape for a long vigil if they relaxed and enjoyed selves first--I
agreed with Prof.
As for bombing Terra we made no changes in first rotation. Were
getting anguished responses from India, no news from Great China. Yet
India had little to moan about. Had not used a grid on her, too heavily
populated. Aside from picked spots in Thar Desert and some peaks, targets
were coastal waters off seaports.
But should have picked higher mountains or given less warning;
seemed from news that some holy man followed by endless pilgrims chose to
climb each target peak and hold off our retaliation by sheer spiritual
strength.
So we were murderers again. Besides that, our water shots killed
millions of fish and many fishermen, as fishermen and other seafarers had
not heeded warnings. Indian government seemed as furious over fish as
over fishermen--but principle of sacredness of all life did not apply to
us; they wanted our heads.
Africa and Europe responded more sensibly but differently. Life has
never been sacred in Africa and those who went sightseeing on targets got
little bleeding-heart treatment. Europe had a day to learn that we could
hit where we promised and that our bombs were deadly. People killed, yes,
especially bullheaded sea captains. But not killed in empty-headed swarms
as in India and North America. Casualties were even lighter in Brasil and
other parts of South America.
Then was North America's turn again--0950 .28 Saturday 17 Oct '76.
Mike timed it for exactly 1000 our time which, allowing for one
day's progress of Luna in orbit and for rotation of Terra, caused North
America to face toward us at 0500 their East Coast time and 0200 their
West Coast time.
But argument as to what to do with this targeting had started early
Saturday morning. Prof had not called meeting of War Cabinet but they
showed up anyhow, except "Clayton" Watenabe who had gone back to
Kongville to take charge of defenses. Prof, self, Finn, Wyoh, Judge
Brody, Wolfgang, Stu, Terence Sheehan--which made eight different
opinions. Prof is right; more than three people can't decide anything.
Six opinions, should say, for Wyoh kept pretty mouth shut, and so
did Prof; he moderated. But others were noisy enough for eighteen. Stu

didn't care what we hit--provided New York Stock Exchange opened on
Monday morning. "We sold short in nineteen different directions on
Thursday. If this nation is not to be bankrupt before it's out of its
cradle, my buy orders covering those shorts had better be executed. Tell
them, Wolf; make them understand."
Brody wanted to use catapult to smack any more ships leaving
parking orbit. Judge knew nothing about ballistics--simply understood
that his drillmen were in exposed positions. I didn't argue as most
remaining loads were already in stow orbits and rest would be soon--and
didn't think we would have old catapult much longer.
Sheenie thought it would be smart to repeat that grid while placing
one load exactly on main building of North American Directorate. "I know
Americans, I was one before they shipped me. They're sorry as hell they
ever turned things over to F. N. Knock off those bureaucrats and they'll
come over to our side."
Wolfgang Korsakov, to Stu's disgust, thought that theft
speculations might do better if all stock exchanges were closed till it
was over.
Finn wanted to go for broke--warn them to get those ships out of
our sky, then hit them for real if they didn't. "Sheenie is wrong about
Americans; I know them, too. N. A. is toughest part of F. N.; they're the
ones to lick. They're already calling us murderers, so now we've got to
hit them, hard! Hit American cities and we can call off the rest."
I slid out, talked with Mike, made notes. Went back in; they were
still arguing. Prof looked up as I sat down. "Field Marshal, you have not
expressed your opinion."
I said, "Prof, can't we lay off that 'field marshal' nonsense?
Children are in bed, can afford to be honest."
"As you wish, Manuel."
"Been waiting to see if any agreement would be reached."
Was none. "Don't see why I should have opinion," I went on. "Am
just errand boy, here because I know how to program ballistic computer."
Said this looking straight at Wolfgang--a number-one comrade but a dirtyword intellectual. I'm just a mechanic whose grammar isn't much while
Wolf graduated from a fancy school, Oxford, before they convicted him. He
deferred to Prof but rarely to anybody else. Stu, da--but Stu had fancy
credentials, too.
Wolf stirred uneasily and said, "Oh, come, Mannie, of course we
want your opinions."
"Don't have any. Bombing plan was worked out carefully; everybody
had chance to criticize. Haven't seen anything justify changing it."
Prof said, "Manuel, will you review the second bombardment of North
America for the benefit of all of us?"
"Okay. Purpose of second smearing is to force them to use up
interceptor rockets. Every shot is aimed at big cities--at null targets,
I mean, close to big cities. Which we tell them, shortly before we hit
them--how soon, Sheenie?"
"We're telling them now. But we can change it. And should."
"As may be. Propaganda isn't my pidgin. In most cases, to aim close
enough to force them to intercept we have to use water targets--rough
enough; besides killing fish and anybody who won't stay off water, it
causes tremjous local storms and shore damage."
Glanced at watch, saw I would have to stall. "Seattle gets one in
Puget Sound right in her lap. San Francisco is going to lose two bridges

she's fond of. Los Angeles gets one between Long Beach and Catalina and
another a few kilometers up coast. Mexico City is inland so we put one on
Popocatepetl where they can see it. Salt Lake City gets one in her lake.
Denver we ignore; they can see what's happening in Colorado Springs--for
we smack Cheyenne Mountain again and keep it up, just as soon as we have
it in line-of-sight. Saint Louis and Kansas City get shots in their
rivers and so does New Orleans--probably flood New Orleans. All Great
Lake cities get it, a long list--shall I read it?"
"Later perhaps," said Prof. "Go ahead."
"Boston gets one in her harbor, New York gets one in Long Island
Sound and another midway between her two biggest bridges--think it will
ruin those bridges but we promise to miss them and will. Going down their
east coast, we give treatment to two Delaware Bay cities, then two on
Chesapeake Bay, one being of max historical and sentimental importance.
Farther south we catch three more big cities with sea shots, Going inland
we smack Cincinnati, Birmingham, Chattanooga, Oklahoma City, all with
river shots or nearby mountains. Oh, yes, Dallas--we destroy Dallas
spaceport and should catch some ships, were six there last time I
checked. Won't kill any people unless they insist on standing on target;
Dallas is perfect place to bomb, that spaceport is big and flat and
empty, yet maybe ten million people will see us hit it."
"If you hit it," said Sheenie.
"When, not 'if.' Each shot is backed up by one an hour later. If
neither one gets through, we have shots farther back which can be
diverted--for example easy to shift targets among Delaware-BayChesapeake-Bay group. Same for Great Lakes group. But Dallas has its own
string of backups and a long one--we expect it to be heavily defended.
Backups run about six hours, as long as we can see North America--and
last backups can be placed anywhere on continent... since farther out a
load is when we divert it, farther we can shift it."
"I don't follow that," said Brody.
"A matter of vectors, Judge. A guidance rocket can give a load so
many meters per second of side vector. Longer that vector has to work,
farther from original point of aim load will land. If we signal a
guidance rocket three hours before impact, we displace impact three times
as much as if we waited till one hour before impact. Not quite that
simple but our computer can figure it--if you give it time enough."
"How long is 'time enough'?" asked Wolfgang.
I carefully misunderstood. "Computer can solve that sort of problem
almost instantaneously once you program it. But such decisions are preprogrammed. Something like this: If, out of target group A, B, C, and D,
you find that you have failed to hit three targets on first and second
salvoes, you reposition all group-one second backups so that you will be
able to choose those three targets while distributing other second
backups of that group for possible use on group two while repositioning
third backups of supergroup Alpha such that--"
"Slow up!" said Wolfgang. "I'm not a computer. I just want to know
how long before we have to make up our minds."
"Oh." I studied watch showily. "You now have... three minutes
fifty-eight seconds in which to abort leading load for Kansas City. Abort
program is set up and I have my best assistant--fellow named Mike-standing by. Shall I phone him?"
Sheenie said, "For heaven's sake, Man--abort!"
"Like hell!" said Finn. "What's matter, Terence? No guts?"

Prof said, "Comrades! Please!"
I said, "Look, I take orders from head of state--Prof over there.
If he wants opinions, he'll ask. No use yelling at each other." I looked
at watch. "Call it two and a half minutes. More margin, of course, for
other targets; Kansas City is farthest from deep water. But some Great
Lake cities are already past ocean abort; Lake Superior is best we can
do. Salt Lake City maybe an extra minute. Then they pile up." I waited.
"Roll call," said Prof. "To carry-out the program. General
Nielsen?"
"Da!"
"Gospazha Davis?"
Wyoh caught breath. "Da."
"Judge Brody?"
"Yes, of course. Necessary."
"Wolfgang?"
"Yes."
"Comte LaJoie?"
"Da."
"Gospodin Sheehan?"
"You're missing a bet. But I'll go along. Unanimous."
"One moment. Manuel?"
"Is up to you, Prof; always has been. Voting is silly."
"I am aware that it is up to me, Gospodin Minister. Carry out
bombardment to plan."
Most targets we managed to hit by second salvo though all were
defended except Mexico City. Seemed likely (98 .3 percent by Mike's later
calculation) that interceptors were exploding by radar fusing with set
distances that incorrectly estimated vulnerability of solid cylinders of
rock. Only three rocks were destroyed; others were pushed off course and
thereby did more harm than if not fired at.
New York was tough; Dallas turned out to be very tough. Perhaps
difference lay in local control of interception, for it seemed unlikely
that command post in Cheyenne Mountain was still effective. Perhaps we
had not cracked their hole in the ground (don't know how deep down it
was) but I'll bet that neither men nor computers were still tracking.
Dallas blew up or pushed aside first five rocks, so I told Mike to
take everything he could from Cheyenne Mountain and award it to Dallas...
which he was able to do two salvoes later; those two targets are less
than a thousand kilometers apart.
Dallas's defenses cracked on next salvo; Mike gave their spaceport
three more (already committed) then shifted back to Cheyenne Mountain-later ones had never been nudged and were still earmarked "Cheyenne
Mountain." He was still giving that battered mountain cosmic love pats
when America rolled down and under Terra's eastern edge.
I stayed with Mike all during bombardment, knowing it would be our
toughest. As he shut down till time to dust Great China, Mike said
thoughtfully, "Man, I don't think we had better hit that mountain again."
"Why not, Mike?"
"It's not there any longer."
"You might divert its backups. When do you have to decide?"
"I would put them on Albuquerque and Omaha but had best start now;
tomorrow will be busy. Man my best friend, you should leave."
"Bored with me, pal?"

"In the next few hours that first ship may launch missiles. When
that happens I want to shift all ballistic control to Little David's
Sling--and when I do, you should be at Mare Undarum site."
"What's fretting you, Mike?"
"That boy is accurate, Man. But he's stupid. I want him supervised.
Decisions may have to be made in a hurry and there isn't anyone there who
can program him properly. You should be there."
"Okay if you say so, Mike. But if needs a fast program, will still
have to phone you." Greatest shortcoming of computers isn't computer
shortcoming at all but fact that a human takes a long time, maybe hours,
to set up a program that a computer solves in milliseconds. One best
quality of Mike was that he could program himself. Fast. Just explain
problem, let him program. Samewise and equally, he could program "idiot
son" enormously faster than human could.
"But, Man, I want you there because you may not be able to phone
me; the lines may be cut. So I've prepared a group of possible programs
for Junior; they may be helpful."
"Okay, print 'em out. And let me talk to Prof."
Mike got Prof; I made sure he was private, then explained what Mike
thought I should do. Thought Prof would object--was hoping he would
insist I stay through coming bombardment/invasion/whatever--those ships.
Instead he said, "Manuel, it's essential that you go. I've hesitated to
tell you. Did you discuss odds with Mike?"
"Nyet."
"I have continued to do so. To put it bluntly, if Luna City is
destroyed and I am dead and the rest of the government is dead--even if
all Mike's radar eyes here are blinded and he himself is cut off from the
new catapult--all of which may happen under severe bombardment... even if
all this happens at once, Mike still gives Luna even chances if Little
David's Sling can operate--and you are there to operate it."
I said, "Da, Boss. Yassuh, Massuh. You and Mike are stinkers and
want to hog fun. Will do."
"Very good, Manuel."
Stayed with Mike another hour while he printed out meter after
meter of programs tailored to other computer--work that would have taken
me six months even if able to think of all possibilities. Mike had it
indexed and cross-referenced--with horribles in it I hardly dare mention.
Mean to say, given circumstances and seemed necessary to destroy (say)
Paris, this told how--what missiles in what orbits, how to tell Junior to
find them and bring to target. Or anything.
Was reading this endless document--not programs but descriptions of
purpose-of-program that headed each--when Wyoh phoned. "Mannie dear, has
Prof told you about going to Mare Undarum?"
"Yes. Was going to call you."
"All right. I'll pack for us and meet you at Station East. When can
you be there?"
"Pack for 'us'? You're going?"
"Didn't Prof say?"
"No." Suddenly felt cheerful.
"I felt guilty about it, dear. I wanted to go with you... but had
no excuse. After all, I'm no use around a computer and I do have
responsibilities here. Or did. But now I've been fired from all my jobs
and so have you."
"Huh?"

"You are no longer Defense Minister; Finn is. Instead you are
Deputy Prime Minister--"
"Well!"
"--and Deputy Minister of Defense, too. I'm already Deputy Speaker
and Stu has been appointed Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
So he goes with us, too."
"I'm confused."
"It's not as sudden as it sounds; Prof and Mike worked it out
months ago. Decentralization, dear, the same thing that McIntyre has been
working on for the warrens. If there is a disaster at L-City, Luna Free
State still has a government. As Prof put it to me, 'Wyoh dear lady, as
long as you three and a few Congressmen are left alive, all is not lost.
You can still negotiate on equal terms and never admit your wounds.'"
So I wound up as a computer mechanic. Stu and Wyoh met me, with
luggage (including rest of my arms), and we threaded through endless
unpressured tunnels in p-suits, on a small flatbed rolligon used to haul
steel to site. Greg had big rolligon meet us for surface stretch, then
met us himself when we went underground again.
So I missed attack on ballistic radars Saturday night.

28
Captain of first ship, FNS Esperance, had guts. Late Saturday he changed
course, headed straight in. Apparently figured we might attempt jinglejangle with radars, for he seems to have decided to come in close enough
to see our radar installations by ship's radar rather than rely on
letting his missiles home in on our beams.
Seems to have considered himself, ship, and crew expendable, for he
was down to a thousand kilometers before he launched, a spread that went
straight for five out of six of Mike's radars, ignoring random jinglejangle.
Mike, expecting self soon to be blinded, turned Brody's boys loose
to burn ship's eyes, held them on it for three seconds before he shifted
them to missiles.
Result: one crashed cruiser, two ballistic radars knocked out by Hmissiles, three missiles "killed"--and two gun crews killed, one by Hexplosion, other by dead missile that landed square on them--plus
thirteen gunners with radiation burns above 800-roentgen death level,
partly from flash, partly from being on surface too long. And must add:
Four members of Lysistrata Corps died with those crews; they elected to
p-suit and go up with their men. Other girls had serious radiation
exposure but not up to 800-r level.
Second cruiser continued an elliptical orbit around and behind
Luna.
Got most of this from Mike after we arrived Little David's Sling
early Sunday. He was feeling groused over loss of two of his eyes and
still more groused over gun crews--I think Mike was developing something
like human conscience; he seemed to feel it was his fault that he had not

been able to outfight six targets at once. I pointed out that what he had
to fight with was improvised, limited range, not real weapons.
"How about self, Mike? Are you right?"
"In all essentials. I have outlying discontinuities. One live
missile chopped my circuits to Novy Leningrad, but reports routed through
Luna City inform me that local controls tripped in satisfactorily with no
loss in city services. I feel frustrated by these discontinuities--but
they can be dealt with later."
"Mike, you sound tired."
"Me tired? Ridiculous! Man, you forget what I am. I'm annoyed,
that's all."
"When will that second ship be back in sight?"
"In about three hours if he were to hold earlier orbit. But he will
not--probability in excess of ninety percent. I expect him in about an
hour."
"A Garrison orbit, huh? Oho!"
"He left my sight at azimuth and course east thirty-two north. Does
that suggest anything, Man?"
Tried to visualize. "Suggests they are going to land and try to
capture you, Mike. Have you told Finn? I mean, have you told Prof to warn
Finn?"
"Professor knows. But that is not the way I analyze it."
"So? Well, suggests I had better shut up and let you work."
Did so. Lenore fetched me breakfast while I inspected Junior--and
am ashamed to say could not manage to grieve over losses with both Wyoh
and Lenore present. Mum had sent Lenore out "to cook for Greg" after
Milla's death--just an excuse; were enough wives at site to provide
homecooking for everybody. Was for Greg's morale and Lenore's, too;
Lenore and Milla had been close.
Junior seemed to be right. He was working on South America, one
load at a time. I stayed in radar room and watched, at extreme
magnification, while he placed one in estuary between Montevideo and
Buenos Aires; Mike could not have been more accurate. I then checked his
program for North America, found naught to criticize--locked it in and
took key. Junior was on his own--unless Mike got clear of other troubles
and decided to take back control.
Then sat and tried to listen to news both from Earthside and LCity. Co-ax cable from L-City carried phones, Mike's hookup to his idiot
child, radio, and video; site was no longer isolated. But, besides cable
from L-City, site had antennas pointed at Terra; any Earthside news
Complex could pick up, we could listen to directly. Nor was this silly
extra; radio and video from Terra had been only recreation during
construction and this was now a standby in case that one cable was
broken.
F. N. official satellite relay was claiming that Luna's ballistic
radars had been destroyed and that we were now helpless. Wondered what
people of Buenos Aires and Montevideo thought about that. Probably too
busy to listen; in some ways water shots were worse than those where we
could find open land.
Luna City Lunatic's video channel was carrying Sheenie telling
Loonies outcome of attack by Esperance, repeating news while warning
everybody that battle was not over, a warship would be back in our sky
any moment--be ready for anything, everybody stay in p-suits (Sheenie was
wearing his, with helmet open), take maximum pressure precautions, all

units stay on red alert, all citizens not otherwise called by duty
strongly urged to seek lowest level and stay there till all clear. And so
forth.
He went through this several times--then suddenly broke it: "Flash!
Enemy cruiser radar-sighted, low and fast. It may dido for Luna City.
Flash! Missiles launched, headed for ejection end of--"
Picture and sound chopped off.
Might as well tell now what we at Little David's Sling learned
later: Second cruiser, by coming in low and fast, tightest orbit Luna's
field permits, was able to start its bombing at ejection end of old
catapult, a hundred kilometers from catapult head and Brody's gunners,
and knock many rings out in minute it took him to come into sight-andrange of drill guns, all clustered around radars at catapult head. Guess
he felt safe. Wasn't. Brody's boys burned eyes out and ears off. He made
one orbit after that and crashed near Torricelli, apparently in attempt
to land, for his jets fired just before crash.
But our next news at new site was from Earthside: that brassy F. N.
frequency claimed that our catapult had been destroyed (true) and that
Lunar menace was ended (false) and called on all Loonies to take prisoner
their false leaders and surrender themselves to mercy of Federated
Nations (nonexistent--"mercy," that is).
Listened to it and checked programming again, and went inside dark
radar room. If everything went as planned, we were about to lay another
egg in Hudson River, then targets in succession for three hours across
that continent--"in succession" because Junior could not handle
simultaneous hits; Mike had planned accordingly.
Hudson River was hit on schedule. Wondered how many New Yorkers
were listening to F. N. newscast while looking at spot that gave it lie.
Two hours later F. N. station was saying that Lunar rebels had had
missiles in orbit when catapult was destroyed--but that after those few
had impacted would be no more. When third bombing of North America was
complete I shut down radar. Had not been running steadily; Junior was
programmed to sneak looks only as necessary, a few seconds at a time.
I then had nine hours before next bombing of Great China.
But not nine hours for most urgent decision, whether to hit Great
China again. Without information. Except from Terra's news channels.
Which might be false. Bloody. Without knowing whether or not warrens had
been bombed. Or Prof was dead or alive. Double bloody. Was I now acting
prime minister? Needed Prof: "head of state" wasn't my glass of chai.
Above all, needed Mike--to calculate facts, estimate uncertainties,
project probabilities of this course or that.
My word, didn't even know whether ships were headed toward us and,
worse yet, was afraid to look. If turned radar on and used Junior for sky
search, any warship he brushed with beams would see him quicker than he
saw them; warships were built to spot radar surveillance. So had heard.
Hell, was no military man; was computer technician who had bumbled into
wrong field.
Somebody buzzed door; I got up and unlocked. Was Wyoh, with coffee.
Didn't say a word, just handed it to me and went away.
Sipped it. There it is, boy--they're leaving you alone, waiting for
you to pull miracles out of pouch. Didn't feel up to it.
From somewhere, back in my youth, heard Prof say, "Manuel, when
faced with a problem you do not understand, do any part of it you do
understand, then look at it again." He had been teaching me something he

himself did not understand very well--something in maths--but had taught
me something far more important, a basic principle.
Knew at once what to do first.
Went over to Junior and had him print out predicted impacts of all
loads in orbit--easy, was a pre-program he could run anytime against real
time running. While he was doing it, I looked for certain alternate
programs in that long roll Mike had prepared.
Then set up some of those alternate programs--no trouble, simply
had to be careful to read them correctly and punch them in without error.
Made Junior print back for check before I gave him signal to execute.
When finished--forty minutes--every load in trajectory intended for
an inland target had been retargeted for a seacoast city--with hedge to
my bet that execution was delayed for rocks farther back. But, unless I
canceled, Junior would reposition them as soon as need be.
Now horrible pressure of time was off me, now could abort any load
into ocean right up to last few minutes before impact. Now could think.
So did.
Then called in my 'War Cabinet"--Wyoh, Stu, and Greg my "Commander
of Armed Forces," using Greg's office. Lenore was allowed to go in and
out, fetching coffee and food, or sitting and saying nothing. Lenore is a
sensible fem and knows when to keep quiet.
Stu started it. "Mr. Prime Minister, I do not think that Great
China should be hit this time."
"Never mind fancy titles, Stu. Maybe I'm acting, maybe not. But
haven't time for formality."
"Very well. May I explain my proposal?"
"Later." I explained what I had done to give us more time; he
nodded and kept quiet. "Our tightest squeeze is that we are out of
communication, both Luna City and Earthside. Greg, how about that repair
crew?"
"Not back yet."
"If break is near Luna City, they may be gone a long time. If can
repair at all. So must assume we'll have to act on our own. Greg, do you
have an electronics tech who can jury-rig a radio that will let us talk
to Earthside? To their satellites, I mean--that doesn't take much with
right antenna. I may be able to help and that computer tech I sent you
isn't too clumsy, either." (Quite good, in fact, for ordinary
electronics--a poor bloke I had once falsely accused of allowing a fly to
get into Mike's guts. I had placed him in this job.)
"Harry Biggs, my power plant boss, can do anything of that sort,"
Greg said thoughtfully, "if he has the gear."
"Get him on it. You can vandalize anything but radar and computer
once we get all loads out of catapult. How many lined up?"
"Twenty-three, and no more steel."
"So twenty-three it is, win or lose. I want them ready for loading;
might lob them off today."
"They're ready. We can load as fast as the cat can throw them."
"Good. One more thing--Don't know whether there's an F. N. cruiser-maybe more than one--in our sky or not. And afraid to look. By radar, I
mean; radar for skywatch could give away our position. But must have
skywatch. Can you get volunteers for an eyeball skywatch and can you
spare them?"
Lenore spoke up. "I volunteer!"
"Thanks, honey; you're accepted."

"We'll find them," said Greg. "Won't need fems."
"Let her do it, Greg; this is everybody's show. " Explained what I
wanted: Mare Undarum was now in dark semi-lunar; Sun had set. Invisible
boundary between sunlight and Luna's shadow stretched over us, a precise
locus. Ships passing through our sky would wink suddenly into view going
west, blink out going east. Visible part of orbit would stretch from
horizon to some point in sky. If eyeball team could spot both points,
mark one by bearing, other by stars, and approximate time by counting
seconds, Junior could start guessing orbit--two passes and Junior would
know its period and something about shape of orbit. Then I would have
some notion of when would be safe to use radar and radio, and catapult-did not want to loose a load with F. N. ship above horizon, could be
radar-looking our way.
Perhaps too cautious--but had to assume that this catapult, this
one radar, these two dozen missiles, were all that stood between Luna and
total defeat--and our bluff hinged on them never knowing what we had or
where it was. We had to appear endlessly able to pound Terra with
missiles, from source they had not suspected and could never find.
Then as now, most Loonies knew nothing about astronomy--we're cave
dwellers, we go up to surface only when necessary. But we were lucky; was
amateur astronomer in Greg's crew, cobber who had worked at Richardson. I
explained, put him in charge, let him worry about teaching eyeball crew
how to tell stars apart. I got these things started before we went back
to talk-talk. "Well, Stu? Why shouldn't we hit Great China?"
"I'm still expecting word from Dr. Chan. I received one message
from him, phoned here shortly before we were cut off from cities--"
"My word, why didn't you tell me?"
"I tried to, but you had yourself locked in and I know better than
to bother you when you are busy with ballistics. Here's the translation.
Usual LuNoHo Company address with a reference which means it's for me and
that it has come through my Paris agent. 'Our Darwin sales
representative'--that's Chan--'informs us that your shipments of'--well,
never mind the coding; he means the attack days while appearing to refer
to last June--'were improperly packaged resulting in unacceptable damage.
Unless this can be corrected, negotiations for long-term contract will be
seriously jeopardized."
Stu looked up. "All doubletalk. I take it to mean that Dr. Chan
feels that he has his government ready to talk terms... but that we
should let up on bombing Great China or we may upset his apple cart."
"Hmm--" Got up and walked around. Ask Wyoh's opinion? Nobody knew
Wyoh's virtues better than I... but she oscillated between fierceness and
too-human compassion--and I had learned already that a "head of state,"
even an acting one, must have neither. Ask Greg? Greg was a good farmer,
a better mechanic, a rousing preacher; I loved him dearly--but did not
want his opinion. Stu? I had had his opinion.
Or did I? "Stu, what's your opinion? Not Chan's opinion--but your
own."
Stu looked thoughtful. "That's difficult, Mannie. I am not Chinese,
I have not spent much time in Great China, and can't claim to be expert
in their politics nor their psychology. So I'm forced to depend on his
opinion."
"Uh--Damn it, he's not a Loonie! His purposes are not our purposes.
What does he expect to get out of it?"

"I think he is maneuvering for a monopoly over Lunar trade. Perhaps
bases here, too. Possibly an extraterritorial enclave. Not that we would
grant that."
"Might if we were hurtin'."
"He didn't say any of this. He doesn't say much, you know. He
listens."
"Too well I know." Worried at it, more bothered each minute.
News from Earthside had been droning in background; I had asked
Wyoh to monitor while I was busy with Greg. "Wyoh, hon, anything new from
Earthside?"
"No. The same claims. We've been utterly defeated and our surrender
is expected momentarily. Oh, there's a warning that some missiles are
still in space, falling out of control, but with it a reassurance that
the paths are being analyzed and people will be warned in time to avoid
impact areas."
"Anything to suggest that Prof--or anybody in Luna City, or
anywhere in Luna--is in touch with Earthside?"
"Nothing at all."
"Damn. Anything from Great China?"
"No. Comments from almost everywhere else. But not from Great
China."
"Uh--" Stepped to door. "Greg! Hey, cobber, see if you can find
Greg Davis. I need him."
Closed door. "Stu, we're not going to let Great China off."
"No?"
"No. Would be nice if Great China busted alliance against us; might
save us some damage. But we've got this far only by appearing able to hit
them at will and to destroy any ship they send against us. At least I
hope that last one was burned and we've certainly clobbered eight out of
nine. We won't get anywhere by looking weak, not while F. N. is claiming
that we are not just weak but finished. Instead we must hand them
surprises. Starting with Great China and if it makes Dr. Chan unhappy,
we'll give him a kerchief to weep into. If we can go on looking strong-when F. N. says we're licked--then eventually some veto power is going to
crack. If not Great China, then some other one."
Stu bowed without getting up. "Very well, sir."
"I--"
Greg came in. "You want me, Mannie?"
"What makes with Earthside sender?"
"Harry says you have it by tomorrow. A crummy rig, he says, but
push watts through it and will be heard."
"Power we got. And if he says 'tomorrow' then he knows what he
wants to build. So will be today--say six hours. I'll work under him.
Wyoh hon, will you get my arms? Want number-six and number-three--better
bring number-five, too. And you stick with me and change arms for me.
Stu, want you to write some nasty messages--I'll give you general idea
and you put acid in them. Greg, we are not going to get all those rocks
into space at once. Ones we have in space now will impact in next
eighteen, nineteen hours. Then, when F. N. is announcing that all rocks
are accounted for and Lunar menace is over... we crash into their
newscast and warn of next bombings. Shortest possible orbits, Greg, ten
hours or less--so check everything on catapult and H-plant and controls;
with that extra boost all has to be dead on."

Wyoh was back with arms; I told her "number six" and added, "Greg,
let me talk with Harry."
Six hours later sender was ready to beam toward Terra. Was ugly
job, vandalized mainly out of a resonance prospector used in project's
early stages. But could ride an audio signal on its radio frequency and
was powerful. Stu's nastified versions of my warnings had been taped and
Harry was ready to zipsqueal them--all Terran satellites could accept
high speed at sixty-to-one and had no wish to have our sender heated more
seconds than necessary; eyeball watch had confirmed fears: At least two
ships were in orbit around Luna.
So we told Great China that her major coastal cities would each
receive a Lunar present offset ten kilometers into ocean--Pusan,
Tsingtao, Taipei, Shanghai, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Djakarta, Darwin,
and so forth--except that Old Hong Kong would get one smack on top of F.
N. 's Far East offices, so kindly have all human beings move far back.
Stu noted that human beings did not mean F. N. personnel; they were urged
to stay at desks.
India was given similar warnings about coastal cities and was told
that F. N. global offices would be spared one more rotation out of
respect for cultural monuments in Agra--and to permit human beings to
evacuate. (I intended to extend this by another rotation as deadline
approached--out of respect for Prof. And then another, indefinitely. Damn
it, they would build their home offices next door to most overdecorated
tomb ever built. But one that Prof treasured.)
Rest of world was told to keep their seats; game was going extra
innings. But stay away from any F. N. offices anywhere; we were frothing
at mouth and no F. N. office was safe. Better yet, get out of any city
containing an F. N. headquarters--but F. N. vips and finks were urged to
sit tight.
Then spent next twenty hours coaching Junior into sneaking his
radar peeks when our sky was clear of ships, or believed to be. Napped
when I could and Lenore stayed with me and woke me in time for next
coaching. And that ended Mike's rocks and we all went into alert while we
got first of Junior's rocks flung high and fast. Waited until certain it
had gone hot and true--then told Terra where to look for it and where and
when to expect it, so that all would know that F. N.'s claims of victory
were on a par with their century of lies about Luna--all in Stu's best,
snotty, supercilious phrases delivered in his cultured accents.
First one should have been for Great China but was one piece of
North American Directorate we could reach with it--her proudest jewel,
Hawaii. Junior placed it in triangle formed by Maui, Molokai, and Lanai.
I didn't work out programming; Mike had anticipated everything.
Then pronto we got off ten more rocks at short intervals (had to
skip one program, a ship in our sky) and told Great China where to look
and when to expect them and where--coastal cities we had neglected day
before.
Was down to twelve rocks but decided was safer to run out of
ammunition than to look as if we were running out. So I awarded seven to
Indian coastal cities, picking new targets--and Stu inquired sweetly if
Agra had been evacuated. If not, please tell us at once. (But heaved no
rock at it.)
Egypt was told to clear shipping out of Suez Canal--bluff; was
hoarding last five rocks.
Then waited.

Impact at Lahaina Roads, that target in Hawaii. Looked good at high
mag; Mike could be proud of Junior.
And waited.
Thirty-seven minutes before first China Coast impact Great China
denounced actions of F. N., recognized us, offered to negotiate--and I
sprained a finger punching abort buttons.
Then was punching buttons with sore finger; India stumbled over
feet following suit.
Egypt recognized us. Other nations started scrambling for door.
Stu informed Terra that we had suspended--only suspended, not
stopped--bombardments. Now get those ships out of our sky at once--NOW!-and we could talk. If they could not get home without refilling tanks,
let them land not less than fifty kilometers from any mapped warren, then
wait for their surrender to be accepted. But clear our sky now!
This ultimatum we delayed a few minutes to let a ship pass beyond
horizon; we weren't taking chances--one missile and Luna would have been
helpless.
And waited.
Cable crew returned. Had gone almost to Luna City, found break. But
thousands of tonnes of loose rock impeded repair, so they had done what
they could--gone back to a spot where they could get through to surface,
erected a temporary relay in direction they thought Luna City lay, sent
up a dozen rockets at ten-minute intervals, and hoped that somebody would
see, understand, aim a relay at it--Any communication?
No.
Waited.
Eyeball squad reported that a ship which had been clockfaithful for
nineteen passes had failed to show. Ten minutes later they reported that
another ship had missed expected appearance.
We waited and listened.
Great China, speaking on behalf of all veto powers, accepted
armistice and stated that our sky was now clear. Lenore burst into tears
and kissed everybody she could reach.
After we steadied down (a man can't think when women are grabbing
him, especially when five of them are not his wives)--a few minutes
later, when we were coherent, I said, "Stu, want you to leave for Luna
City at once. Pick your party. No women--you'll have to walk surface last
kilometers. Find out what's going on--but first get them to aim a relay
at ours and phone me."
"Very good, sir."
We were getting him outfitted for a tough journey--extra air
bottles, emergency shelter, so forth--when Earthside called me on
frequency we were listening to because message was (learned later) on all
frequencies up from Earthside: "Private message, Prof to Mannie-identification, birthday Bastille and Sherlock's sibling. Come home at
once. Your carriage waits at your new relay. Private message, Prof to--"
And went on repeating.
"Harry!"
"Da, Boss?"
"Message Earthside--tape and squeal; we still don't want them
ranging us. 'Private message, Mannie to Prof. Brass Cannon. On my way!'
Ask them to acknowledge--but use only one squeal."

29
Stu and Greg drove on way back, while Wyoh and Lenore and I huddled on
open flatbed, strapped to keep from falling off; was too small. Had time
to think; neither girl had suit radio and we could talk only by helmet
touch--awkward.
Began to see--now that we had won--parts of Prof's plan that had
never been clear to me. Inviting attack against catapult had spared
warrens--hoped it had; that was plan--but Prof had always been cheerfully
indifferent to damage to catapult. Sure, had a second one--but far away
and difficult to reach. Would take years to put a tube system to new
catapult, high mountains all way. Probably cheaper to repair old one. If
possible.
Either way, no grain shipped to Terra in meantime.
And that was just what Prof wanted! Yet never once had he hinted
that his plan was based on destroying old catapult--his long-range plan,
not just Revolution. He might not admit it now. But Mike would tell me-if put to him flatly: Was or was not this one factor in odds? Food riot
predictions and all that, Mike? He would tell me.
That tonne-for-tonne deal--Prof had expounded it Earthside, had
been argument for a Terran catapult. But privately he had no enthusiasm
for it. Once he had told me, in North America, "Yes, Manuel, I feel sure
it would work. But, if built, it will be temporary. There was a time, two
centuries ago, when dirty laundry used to be shipped from California to
Hawaii--by sailing ship, mind you--and clean laundry returned. Special
circumstances. If we ever see water and manure shipped to Luna and grain
shipped back, it will be just as temporary. Luna's future lies in her
unique position at the top of a gravity well over a rich planet, and in
her cheap power and plentiful real estate. If we Loonies have sense
enough in the centuries ahead to remain a free port and to stay out of
entangling alliances, we will become the crossroads for two planets,
three planets, the entire Solar System. We won't be farmers forever."
They met us at Station East and hardly gave time to get p-suits
off--was return from Earthside over again, screaming mobs and being
ridden on shoulders. Even girls, for Slim Lemke said to Lenore, "May we
carry you, too?"--and Wyoh answered, "Sure, why not?"--and stilyagi
fought for chance to.
Most men were pressure-suited and I was surprised to see how many
carried guns--until I saw that they were not our guns; they were
captured. But most of all what blessed relief to see L-City unhurt!
Could have done without triumphal procession; was itching to get to
phone and find out from Mike what had happened--how much damage, how many
killed, what this victory cost. But no chance. We were carried to Old
Dome willy-nilly.
They shoved us up on a platform with Prof and rest of Cabinet apd
vips and such, and our girls slobbered on Prof and he embraced me Latin
style, kiss cheek, and somebody stuck a Liberty Cap on me. Spotted little
Hazel in crowd and threw her a kiss.
At last they quieted enough for Prof to speak.

"My friends," he said, and waited for silence. "My friends," he
repeated softly. "Beloved comrades. We meet at last in freedom and now
have with us the heroes who fought the last battle for Luna, alone." They
cheered us, again he waited. Could see he was tired; hands trembled as he
steadied self against pulpit. "I want them to speak to you, we want to
hear about it, all of us.
"But first I have a happy message. Great China has just announced
that she is building in the Himalayas an enormous catapult, to make
shipping to Luna as easy and cheap as it has been to ship from Luna to
Terra."
He stopped for cheers, then went on, "But that lies in the future.
Today--Oh, happy day! At last the world acknowledges Luna's sovereignty.
Free! You have won your freedom--"
Prof stopped--looked surprised. Not afraid, but puzzled. Swayed
slightly.
Then he did die.

30
We got him into a shop behind platform. But even with help of a dozen
doctors was no use; old heart was gone, strained too many times. They
carried him out back way and I started to follow.
Stu touched my arm. "Mr. Prime Minister--"
I said, "Huh? Oh, for Bog's sake!"
"Mr. Prime Minister," he repeated firmly, "you must speak to the
crowd, send them home. Then there are things that must be done." He spoke
calmly but tears poured down cheeks.
So I got back on platform and confirmed what they had guessed and
told them to go home. And wound up in room L of Raffles, where all had
started--emergency Cabinet meeting. But first ducked to phone, lowered
hood, punched MYCROFTXXX.
Got null-number signal. Tried again--same. Pushed up hood and said
to man nearest me, Wolfgang, "Aren't phones working?"
"Depends," he said. "That bombing yesterday shook things up. If you
want an out-of-town number, better call the phone office."
Could see self asking office to get me a null. "What bombing?"
"Haven't you heard? It was concentrated on the Complex. But Brody's
boys got the ship. No real damage. Nothing that can't be fixed."
Had to drop it; they were waiting. I didn't know what to do but Stu
and Korsakov did. Sheenie was told to write news releases for Terra and
rest of Luna; I found self announcing a lunar of mourning, twenty-four
hours of quiet, no unnecessary business, giving orders for body to lie in
state--all words put into mouth, I was numb, brain would not work. Okay,
convene Congress at end of twenty-four hours. In Novylen? Okay.
Sheenie had dispatches from Earthside. Wolfgang wrote for me
something which said that, because of death of our President, answers
would be delayed at least twenty-four hours.

At last was able to get away, with Wyoh. A stilyagi guard kept
people away from us to easement lock thirteen. Once home I ducked into
workshop on pretense of needing to change arms. "Mike?"
No answer-So tried punching his combo into house phone--null signal. Resolved
to go out to Complex next day--with Prof gone, needed Mike worse than
ever.
But next day was not able to go; trans-Crisium tube was out--that
last bombing. You could go around through Torricelli and Novylen and
eventually reach Hong Kong. But Complex, almost next door, could be
reached only by rolligon. Couldn't take time; I was "government."
Managed to shuck that off two days later. By resolution was decided
that Speaker (Finn) had succeeded to Presidency after Finn and I had
decided that Wolfgang was best choice for Prime Minister. We put it
through and I went back to being Congressman who didn't attend sessions.
By then most phones were working and Complex could be called.
Punched MYCROFFXXX. No answer--So went out by rolligon. Had to go down
and walk tube last kilometer but Complex Under didn't seem hurt.
Nor did Mike appear to be.
But when I spoke to him, he didn't answer.
He has never answered. Has been many years now.
You can type questions into him--in Loglan--and you'll get Loglan
answers out. He works just fine... as a computer. But won't talk. Or
can't.
Wyoh tried to coax him. Then she stopped. Eventually I stopped.
Don't know how it happened. Many outlying pieces of him got chopped
off in last bombing--was meant, I'm sure, to kill our ballistic computer.
Did he fall below that "critical number" it takes to sustain selfawareness? (If is such; was never more than hypothesis.) Or did
decentralizing that was done before that last bombing "kill" him?
I don't know. If was just matter of critical number, well, he's
long been repaired; he must be back up to it. Why doesn't he wake up?
Can a machine be so frightened and hurt that it will go into
catatonia and refuse to respond? While ego crouches inside, aware but
never willing to risk it? No, can't be that; Mike was unafraid--as gaily
unafraid as Prof.
Years, changes--Mimi long ago opted out of family management; Anna
is "Mum" now and Mimi dreams by video. Slim got Hazel to change name to
Stone, two kids and she studied engineering. All those new free-fall
drugs and nowadays earthworms stay three or four years and go home
unchanged. And those other drugs that do almost as much for us; some kids
go Earthside to school now; And Tibet catapult--took seventeen years
instead of ten; Kilimanjaro job was finished sooner.
One mild surprise--When time came, Lenore named Stu for opting,
rather than Wyoh. Made no difference, we all voted "Da!" One thing not a
surprise because Wyoh and I pushed it through during time we still
amounted to something in government: a brass cannon on a pedestal in
middle of Old Dome and over it a flag fluttering in blower breeze--black
field speckled with stars, bar sinister in blood, a proud and jaunty
brass cannon embroidered over all, and below it our motto: TANSTAAFL!
That's where we hold our Fourth-of-July celebrations.
You get only what you pay for--Prof knew and paid, gaily.
But Prof underrated yammerheads. They never adopted any of his
ideas. Seems to be a deep instinct in human beings for making everything

compulsory that isn't forbidden. Prof got fascinated by possibilities for
shaping future that lay in a big, smart computer--and lost track of
things closer home. Oh, I backed him! But now I wonder. Are food riots
too high a price to pay to let people be? I don't know.
Don't know any answers.
Wish I could ask Mike.
I wake up in night and think I've heard him--just a whisper:
"Man... Man my best friend..." But when I say, "Mike?" he doesn't answer.
Is he wandering around somewhere, looking for hardward to hook onto? Or
is he buried down in Complex Under, trying to find way out? Those special
memories are all in there somewhere, waiting to be stirred. But I can't
retrieve them; they were voice-coded.
Oh, he's dead as Prof, I know it. (But how dead is Prof?) If I
punched it just once more and said, "Hi, Mike!" would he answer, "Hi,
Man! Heard any good ones lately?" Been a long time since I've risked it.
But he can't really be dead; nothing was hurt--he's just lost.
You listening, Bog? Is a computer one of Your creatures?
Too many changes--May go to that talk-talk tonight and toss in some

How can entropy be reversed 

The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way: Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.

Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough -- so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share In the glory that was Multivac's.

For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.

But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.

The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.

They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.

"It's amazing when you think of it," said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. "All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever."

Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. "Not forever," he said.

"Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert."

"That's not forever."

"All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?"

Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. "Twenty billion years isn't forever."

"Will, it will last our time, won't it?"

"So would the coal and uranium."

"All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't do THAT on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe me."

"I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that."

"Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us," said Adell, blazing up. "It did all right."

"Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying. We're safe for twenty billion years, but then what?" Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. "And don't say we'll switch to another sun."

There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested.

Then Lupov's eyes snapped open. "You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren't you?"

"I'm not thinking."

"Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and Who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one."

"I get it," said Adell. "Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too."

"Darn right they will," muttered Lupov. "It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all."

"I know all about entropy," said Adell, standing on his dignity.

"The hell you do."

"I know as much as you do."

"Then you know everything's got to run down someday."

"All right. Who says they won't?"

"You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said 'forever.'"

"It was Adell's turn to be contrary. "Maybe we can build things up again someday," he said.

"Never."

"Why not? Someday."

"Never."

"Ask Multivac."

"You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done."

Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?

Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?

Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.

Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

"No bet," whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.

By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten about the incident.

Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered. "That's X-23," said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.

The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, "We've reached X-23 -- we've reached X-23 -- we've ----"

"Quiet, children," said Jerrodine sharply. "Are you sure, Jerrodd?"

"What is there to be but sure?" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.

Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps.

Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.

Someone had once told Jerrodd that the "ac" at the end of "Microvac" stood for "analog computer" in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.

Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. "I can't help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth."

"Why for Pete's sake?" demanded Jerrodd. "We had nothing there. We'll have everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded."

Then, after a reflective pause, "I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing."

"I know, I know," said Jerrodine miserably.

Jerrodette I said promptly, "Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world."

"I think so, too," said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.

It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.

Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetary AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.

"So many stars, so many planets," sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. "I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now."

"Not forever," said Jerrodd, with a smile. "It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase."

"What's entropy, daddy?" shrilled Jerrodette II.

"Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?"

"Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?"

The stars are the power-units, dear. Once they're gone, there are no more power-units."

Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. "Don't let them, daddy. Don't let the stars run down."

"Now look what you've done, " whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.

"How was I to know it would frighten them?" Jerrodd whispered back.

"Ask the Microvac," wailed Jerrodette I. "Ask him how to turn the stars on again."

"Go ahead," said Jerrodine. "It will quiet them down." (Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)

Jarrodd shrugged. "Now, now, honeys. I'll ask Microvac. Don't worry, he'll tell us."

He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, "Print the answer."

Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, "See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry."

Jerrodine said, "and now children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon."

Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.

VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, "Are we ridiculous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?" MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. "I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion."

Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.

"Still," said VJ-23X, "I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council."

"I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up."

VJ-23X sighed. "Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More."

"A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years --"

VJ-23X interrupted. "We can thank immortality for that."

"Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions."

"Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose."

"Not at all," snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, "Not yet. I'm by no means old enough. How old are you?"

"Two hundred twenty-three. And you?"

"I'm still under two hundred. --But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we'll have another filled in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?"

VJ-23X said, "As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next."

"A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year."

"Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those."

"Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we can only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point."

"We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas."

"Or out of dissipated heat?" asked MQ-17J, sarcastically.

"There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC."

VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.

"I've half a mind to," he said. "It's something the human race will have to face someday."

He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC.

MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of sub-mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite it's sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across.

MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, "Can entropy ever be reversed?"

VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, "Oh, say, I didn't really mean to have you ask that."

"Why not?"

"We both know entropy can't be reversed. You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree."

"Do you have trees on your world?" asked MQ-17J.

The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

VJ-23X said, "See!"

The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.

Zee Prime's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity - but a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space. Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.

Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.

"I am Zee Prime," said Zee Prime. "And you?"

"I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?"

"We call it only the Galaxy. And you?"

"We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?"

"True. Since all Galaxies are the same."

"Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different."

Zee Prime said, "On which one?"

"I cannot say. The Universal AC would know."

"Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious."

Zee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.

Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called, out: "Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?"

The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.

Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.

"But how can that be all of Universal AC?" Zee Prime had asked.

"Most of it, " had been the answer, "is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine."

Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.

The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.

A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. "THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN."

But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment.

Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, "And Is one of these stars the original star of Man?"

The Universal AC said, "MAN'S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS NOW A WHITE DWARF."

"Did the men upon it die?" asked Zee Prime, startled and without thinking.

The Universal AC said, "A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME."

"Yes, of course," said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.

Dee Sub Wun said, "What is wrong?"

"The stars are dying. The original star is dead."

"They must all die. Why not?"

"But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them."

"It will take billions of years."

"I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?"

Dee sub Wun said in amusement, "You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction."

And the Universal AC answered. "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

Zee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter.

Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.

Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable. Man said, "The Universe is dying."

Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.

New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.

Man said, "Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years."

"But even so," said Man, "eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum."

Man said, "Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC."

The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.

"Cosmic AC," said Man, "How may entropy be reversed?"

The Cosmic AC said, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

Man said, "Collect additional data."

The Cosmic AC said, "I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESSORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT."

"Will there come a time," said Man, "when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?"

The Cosmic AC said, "NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES."

Man said, "When will you have enough data to answer the question?"

"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

"Will you keep working on it?" asked Man.

The Cosmic AC said, "I WILL."

Man said, "We shall wait."

"The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down. One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.

Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.

Man said, "AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?"

AC said, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

Man's last mind fused and only AC existed -- and that in hyperspace.

Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man. All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.

All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.

But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.

A timeless interval was spent in doing that.

And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.

But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.

For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.

The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.

And AC said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT!"

And there was light----
