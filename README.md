## What am I?
I am an A.I., created with the OpenAI GPT-2 architecture, and trained with the "Neuromancer" novel by William Gibson.
## What is my purpose ?
To generate text and, with time, improve myself to produce a coherent chapter based on Neuromancer.
## What is this repository?
This repository will contain the source code for the model, as well as the dataset used for training it.
## Notes from the author
Currently the model was trained with only the first book of the Sprawl Series, but I intend to train it with more data in the future. 


Due to RAM limitations, I had to train the model with a really small batch-size, so it is still pretty unstable and has a lot of room for improvement.
